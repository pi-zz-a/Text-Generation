PHOEBE:
  hi guys! 

ALL:
 hey, pheebs! hi! 

ROSS:
 hey. oh, oh, how'd it go? 

PHOEBE:
 um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!' 

ALL:
 ohh. ouch. 

RACHEL:
 what? he said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 

MONICA:
 uh, no. loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'. 

RACHEL:
 since when? 

JOEY:
 since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'. 

CHANDLER:
 or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 

PHOEBE:
 or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'. 

RACHEL:
 and everybody knows this? 

JOEY:
 yeah. cushions the blow. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 

ROSS:
 that's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 

MONICA:
 uh, ross. 

ROSS:
 what? wh- hello? the millners' farm in connecticut? the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....oh my god, chi chi!  opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 "so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 

JOEY:
 "warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 

CHANDLER:
 hey, that was really good! 

JOEY:
 thanks! let's keep going. 

CHANDLER:
 okay. "so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?" 

JOEY:
 "i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke." 

CHANDLER:
 "smoke away."  (joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.  he fumbles and drops the lighter.  then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)

CHANDLER:
 i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone. 

JOEY:
 what? 

CHANDLER:
 relax your hand!   

CHANDLER:
 not so much! 

JOEY:
 whoah! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

JOEY:
 hey! 

CHANDLER:
 alright, now try taking a puff.   

CHANDLER:
 alright.. okay. no. give it to me. 

JOEY:
 no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette. 

CHANDLER:
 it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here.   

CHANDLER:
 don't think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. when you're holding it, you feel right. you feel complete. 

JOEY:
 y'miss it? 

CHANDLER:
 nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke.  oh.. my.. god.   

MONICA:
 no, no, no. they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.   

JOEY:
 that's ridiculous! 

ROSS:
 can i use.. either thumb? 

RACHEL:
  alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  decaf cappucino for joey.. coffee black.. late.. and an iced tea. i'm getting pretty good at this! 

ALL:
 yeah. yeah, excellent. 

RACHEL:
  good for me!  (the gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as phoebe enters.  she sits down without saying hi.)

JOEY:
 y'okay, phoebe? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah- no- i'm just- it's, i haven't worked- it's my bank. 

MONICA:
 what did they do to you? 

PHOEBE:
 it's nothing, it's just- okay. i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement- 

ROSS:
 easy. 

PHOEBE:
 - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, satan's minions at work again... 

PHOEBE:
 yes, 'cause now i have to go down there, and deal with them. 

JOEY:
 what are you talking about? keep it! 

PHOEBE:
 it's not mine, i didn't earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 

PHOEBE:
 okay. okay, let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what i'd hear, with every step i took? 'not-mine. not-mine. not-mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... 

MONICA:
 we're with you. we got it.   

PHOEBE:
 okay. i'd- just- i'd never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt. 

RACHEL:
 chandler, what are you doing? 

MONICA:
  hey. whaddya doing?  (chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)

ALL:
 oh! oh, god! 

ROSS:
 what is this?! 

CHANDLER:
 i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years! 

CHANDLER:
 and this- is my reward! 

ROSS:
 hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, so this time i won't quit! 

ALL:
 ohhh! put it out! 

CHANDLER:
 all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out. (he drops it in phoebe's coffee.) 

PHOEBE:
 oh, no! i- i can't drink this now! 

MONICA:
 alright. i'm gonna go change, i've got a date. 

RACHEL:
 this alan again? how's it goin'? 

MONICA:
 's'going pretty good, y'know? it's nice, and, we're having fun. 

JOEY:
 so when do we get to meet the guy? 

MONICA:
 let's see, today's monday... never. 

ALL:
 oh, come on! come on! 

MONICA:
 no. not after what happened with steve. 

CHANDLER:
 what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry. 

MONICA:
 look, i don't even know how i feel about him yet. just give me a chance to figure that out. 

RACHEL:
 well, then can we meet him? 

MONICA:
 nope. schhorry.  

MONICA:
 i mean, why should i let them meet him? i mean, i bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. i mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. 

PAULA:
 listen. as someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, i'll

TELL YOU:
 that is not such a terrible thing. i mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. 

MONICA:
 i know. i just wish that once, i'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. 

PAULA:
 well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..  

JOEY:
 let it go, ross. 

ROSS:
 yeah, well, you didn't know chi chi. 

MONICA:
 do you all promise? 

ALL:
 yeah! we promise! we'll be good! 

MONICA:
  chandler? do you promise to be good?  (chandler makes a 'cross my heart' sign.  it starts to rain and he taps on the window.)

JOEY:
 you can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!   (phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)

ROSS:
 hey, pheebs. 

PHOEBE:
 'dear ms. buffay. thank you for calling attention to our error. we have credited your account with five hundred dollars. we're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' do you believe this?! now i have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 

RACHEL:
 what bank is this?   

MONICA:
 hey. it's him.  who is it? 

ALAN:
  it's alan. 

JOEY:
  chandler! he's here!   

MONICA:
  okay, please be good, please. just remember how much you all like me.   

MONICA:
 hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan. 

ALAN:
 hi. 

ALL:
 hi, alan. 

ALAN:
 i've heard schho much about all you guyschh!   

MONICA:
  okay. okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin. who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?   

MONICA:
 c'mon! 

ROSS:
 ...i'll go. let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, i'm sorry, i can't do this, can't do this. we loved him. 

ALL:
 loved him! yeah! he's great! 

MONICA:
 wait a minute! we're talking about someone that i'm going out with? 

ALL:
 yeah! 

RACHEL:
 and did you notice...?  

THE GUYS:
  yeah. 

JOEY:
 know what was great? the way his smile was kinda crooked. 

PHOEBE:
 yes, yes! like the man in the shoe! 

ROSS:
 ...what shoe? 

PHOEBE:
 from the nursery rhyme. 'there was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile, who lived in a shoe, for a... while...'   

ROSS:
 ...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 

RACHEL:
 what future boyfriends? nono, i th- i think this could be, y'know, it. 

MONICA:
 really! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah. i'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  

ROSS:
 you know what i like most about him, though? 

ALL:
 what? 

ROSS:
 the way he makes me feel about myself. 

ALL:
 yeah...  commercial break    

MONICA:
 hi.. how was the game? 

ROSS:
 well.. 

ALL:
 we won!! thank you! yes! 

MONICA:
 fantastic! i have one question: how is that possible? 

JOEY:
 alan. 

ROSS:
 he was unbelievable. he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first base-alan, second base-alan, third base-... 

RACHEL:
 i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 

CHANDLER:
 yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 

MONICA:
 can i ask you guys a question? d'you ever think that alan is maybe.. sometimes.. 

ROSS:
 what? 

MONICA:
 ..i dunno, a little too alan? 

RACHEL:
 well, no. that's impossible. you can never be too alan. 

ROSS:
 yeah, it's his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 

CHANDLER:
 i personally could have a gallon of alan.  

PHOEBE:
 hey, lizzie. 

LIZZIE:
 hey, weird girl. 

PHOEBE:
 i brought you alphabet soup. 

LIZZIE:
 did you pick out the vowels? 

PHOEBE:
 yes. but i left in the ys. 'cause, y'know, "sometimes y". uh, i also have something else for you.  

LIZZIE:
 saltines? 

PHOEBE:
 no, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 

LIZZIE:
 what?  oh my god, there's really money in here. 

PHOEBE:
 i know. 

LIZZIE:
 weird girl, what are you doing? 

PHOEBE:
 no, i want you to have it. i don't want it. 

LIZZIE:
 no, no, i ha-i have to give you something. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, that's fine, no. 

LIZZIE:
 would you like my tin-foil hat? 

PHOEBE:
 no. 'cause you need that. no, it's okay, thanks. 

LIZZIE:
 please, let me do something. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. okay? 

LIZZIE:
 okay. 

PHOEBE:
 okay.   of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  he types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.   while not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a  

LIZZIE:
 keep the change.  sure you don't wanna pretzel? 

PHOEBE:
 no, i'm fine. 

LIZZIE:
  see ya.   

PHOEBE:
 huh!  

ROSS:
 a thumb?!   

ALL:
 eww! 

PHOEBE:
 i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 

CHANDLER:
 well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five? 

PHOEBE:
 does, um, anyone wanna see? 

ALL:
 nooo!  

ALL:
 oh, hey, don't do that! cut it out! 

RACHEL:
 it's worse than the thumb! 

CHANDLER:
 hey, this is so unfair! 

MONICA:
 oh, why is it unfair? 

CHANDLER:
 so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?  

JOEY:
 ...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 

RACHEL:
 well, i-i could live without it. 

JOEY:
 well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?  

ROSS:
 oh, now, don't listen to him, pheebs, i think it's endearing. 

JOEY:
 oh,  "you do, do you"?   

ROSS:
 you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 

RACHEL:
 "indeed there isn't"... i should really get back to work. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 

RACHEL:
 ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on.   

MONICA:
 did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 

PAULA:
 no. 

MONICA:
 okay.. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 

PAULA:
 waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? all right, a cow got through! 

MONICA:
 can you believe it? ...y'know what? i just don't feel the thing. i mean, they feel the thing, i don't feel the thing. 

PAULA:
 honey.. you should always feel the thing. listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him! 

MONICA:
 i know.. it's gonna be really hard. 

PAULA:
 well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. 

MONICA:
 no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about.  

JOEY:
 do you have any respect for your body? 

ROSS:
 don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 

CHANDLER:
 hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 

RACHEL:
  chandler? it's alan, he wants to speak to you. 

CHANDLER:
 really? he does?  hey, buddy, what's up! oh, she told you about that, huh. well, yeah, i have one now and then. well, yeah, now. well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. well, okay, thanks!  

RACHEL:
  god, he's good. 

ROSS:
 if only he were a woman. 

RACHEL:
 yeah.   

CHANDLER:
 ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 

ROSS:
 okay. i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.  

MONICA:
  hey. where's joey? 

CHANDLER:
 joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong? 

RACHEL:
 i think he's across the hall. 

MONICA:
 thanks.  

ROSS:
  there y'go. 

CHANDLER:
  ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now. 

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that pop-tart?.. pheebs? 

PHOEBE:
 does anyone want the rest of this pop-tart? 

ROSS:
 hey, i might! 

PHOEBE:
 sorry. ..y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 

ALL:
 you're kidding. oh my god. 

PHOEBE:
 and on my way over here, i stepped in gum. ...what is up with the universe?! 

JOEY:
  what's going on? 

MONICA:
 nothing. i just think it's nice when we're all here together. 

JOEY:
 even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 

RACHEL:
 uh, joey.. 

JOEY:
 oh, god!  

MONICA:
  okay.. 

ALL:
 oh! that was lambchop! 

MONICA:
 please, guys, we have to talk. 

PHOEBE:
 wait, wait, i'm getting a deja vu...no, i'm not. 

MONICA:
 alright, we have to talk. 

PHOEBE:
 there it is! 

MONICA:
 okay. it's-it's about alan. there's something that you should know. i mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. i've decided to break up with alan.  

ROSS:
 is there somebody else? 

MONICA:
 no, nononono.. it's just.. things change. people change. 

RACHEL:
 we didn't change.. 

JOEY:
 so that's it? it's over? just like that? 

PHOEBE:
 you know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and i just- i-  

MONICA:
 look, i- i could go on pretending- 

JOEY:
 okay! 

MONICA:
 -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to alan- it wouldn't be fair to you! 

ROSS:
 who-who wants fair? y'know, i just want things back. y'know, the way they were. 

MONICA:
 i'm sorry.. 

CHANDLER:
  oh, she's sorry! i feel better! 

RACHEL:
  i just can't believe this! i mean, with the holidays coming up- i wanted him to meet my family- 

MONICA:
 i'll meet somone else. there'll be other alans. 

ALL:
 oh, yeah! right! 

MONICA:
 are you guys gonna be okay? 

ROSS:
 hey hey, we'll be fine. we're just gonna need a little time. 

MONICA:
  i understand.  

ALAN:
 wow. 

MONICA:
 i'm, i'm really sorry. 

ALAN:
 yeah, i'm sorry too. but, i gotta tell you, i am a little relieved. 

MONICA:
 relieved? 

ALAN:
 yeah, well, i had a great time with you.. i just can't stand your friends.  closing credits  

RACHEL:
 remember when we went to central park and rented boats?.. that was fun. 

ROSS:
 yeah. he could row like a viking. 

MONICA:
  hi. 

ALL:
 mmm. 

ROSS:
 so how'd it go? 

MONICA:
 oh, y'know.. 

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 he said he's really gonna miss you guys.  

ROSS:
 you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (she sits down and ross strokes her forehead.) 

CHANDLER:
 ...that's it. i'm getting cigarettes. 

ALL:
 no no no! 

CHANDLER:
  i don't care, i don't care! game's over! i'm weak! i've gotta smoke! i've gotta have the smoke! 

PHOEBE:
  if you never smoke again i'll give you seven thousand dollars!
