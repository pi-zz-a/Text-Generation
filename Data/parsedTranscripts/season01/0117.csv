rachel: ow ow ow. ow ow ow ow. ow ow ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. 
monica: hi. uh, my friend here was taking down our christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
nurse: my god. you still have your christmas lights up? 
nurse: fill this out and bring it back to me. 
rachel: ow ow ow. ow ow ow. ow ow ow. 
monica: okay, ooh, alright. name, address... okay, in case of emergency, call?
rachel: you.
monica: really?
rachel: yeah.
monica: oh, that is so sweet. (touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) oh gosh, love you. insurance?
rachel: oh, yeah, check it. definitely, i want some of that.
monica:  you don't have insurance?
rachel: why, how much is this gonna cost?
monica: i have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
rachel: wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
monica: well there's not much we can do.
rachel:  um... unless, unless i use yours.
monica: hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
rachel:"  well, now, wait a second, who did i just put as my ""in case of emergency"" person?"
monica: (looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway) that's insurance fraud.
rachel: well, alright, then, forget it.  might as well just go home. ow ow ow ow!
monica:  okay, okay. i hate this.
rachel: thank you. thank you. i love you.
monica:  um, i'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms .
nurse: why?
monica:  you see, i was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information,  i put mine.
nurse: you are an idiot. .
monica:  i am that stupid (tiny laugh).  
ross: i had a dream last night where i was playing football with my kid.
chandler and joey: that's nice.
ross: no, no, with him.  i'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and i, i know i've gotta do something 'cause the tampa bay defence is comin' right at me.
joey: tampa bay's got a terrible team.
ross: right, but, it is just me and the baby, so i'm thinkin' they can take us. and so i uh, hah-hah, i just heave it down field.
chandler: what are you crazy? that's a baby!
joey: he should take the sack?
ross: anyway, suddenly i'm down field, and i realise that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? only i know there is no way i'm gonna get there in time, so i am running, and running, and that, that is when i woke up. see i, i am so not ready to be a father.
chandler: hey, you're gonna be fine. you're one of the most caring, most responsible men in north america. you're gonna make a great dad.
joey: yeah, ross. you and the baby just need better blocking. 
joey: oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the rainbow room? is it real expensive?
chandler: well, only if you order stuff.
joey: i'm takin' ursula tonight. it's her birthday.
ross: wo-wo-whoa. what about phoebe's birthday?
joey: when's that?
ross: tonight.
joey: oh, man. what're the odds of that happening? 
ross: you take your time. 
chandler: there it is! so what're you gonna do?
joey: what can i do? look, i don't want to do anything to screw it up with ursula.
chandler: and your friend phoebe?
joey: well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. i mean, wouldn't you guys?
chandler: man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.   
dr. mitchell: ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference. 
dr. mitchell: okay, errrr, monica?
monica: yes?  ..yes, she is.
rachel : hi, this is my friend rachel.
monica : hi.
dr. mitchell:  hi, err rachel. i'm dr.mitchell.
dr. rosen:  and i'm his friend, dr.rosen. 
rachel: aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
dr. rosen: excuse me?
rachel: i meant er,  young, young, i meant young, young to be a doctor. oh good, rach.
monica : thank you.
rachel : right.  surprise birthday party.  rachel and monica is telling chandler about rachel's 
rachel: ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
monica: uh, you left out the stupid part.
rachel:" not stupid. the very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and i said ""yes."""
monica: i think it's totally insane, i mean, they work for the hospital. it's like returning to the scene of the crime. you know, i say we blow off the dates.
rachel: what? monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
chandler: alright, what have we learned so far? (there is a knock at the door. someone turns the music off, then the whole party runs and hides, except for monica and rachel who answer their door. ross stands in the doorway, holding a box, but everyone is too keyed up to notice that it's him.)
the whole party:  surprise!!! (ross is so startled that he throws his arms up to defend himself. the box takes off, then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. ross is not pleased.)
ross: what the hell are you doing? you scared the crap outta me.
rachel: was that the cake?
ross: yeah, yeah. i got a lemon schmush.
monica: come on, she'll be here any minute. 
rachel: i hope it's okay. 
monica: oh...
chandler:"  ""happy birthday peehe."""
monica: well maybe we can make a, a, a 'b' out of one of those roses. 
ross:  yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
phoebe: hey, what's going on?
ross: oh, we just...
phoebe's friends:  surprise!
phoebe:  oh, oh, oh! this is so great! oh my god! this was not at all scary. hi everybody. hi betty! betty, hi!  you found betty! oh my god! (hugging people) this is great. everybody i love is in the same room,  where's joey? (the party falls flat. chandler tries to think of a witticism, but even he can't help...)
chandler:" did you see betty? (betty waggles her fingers to say ""hi"", but phoebe feels her birthday has been ruined by her twin.)  "
mr. geller:" i tell you one thing, i wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, i'd say ""get out of my office!"""
ross: dad, before i was born, did you freak out at all?
mr. geller: i'm not freaking out, i'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
ross:" dad, dad, dad, i'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""oh my god i'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
mr. geller: no. your mother really did the work. i was busy with the business. i wasn't around that much. is that what this is about?
ross: no, no, dad, i was just wondering.
mr. geller: 'cause there's time to make up for that. we can do stuff together. you always wanted to go to that colonial williamsburg. how 'bout we do that?
ross: thanks, dad, really, i ju... you know, i just, i just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
mr. geller: oh, well, i, i guess it musta been the day after you were born. we were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. you were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. and you squeezed it, so tight. and that's when i knew. 
mr. geller: so you don't wanna go to williamsburg?
ross: no, we can go to williamsburg.
mr. geller: eat your fish.  
monica: rachel, the cute doctors are here.
rachel:  okay, coming! 
monica: hi, come on in.
dr. mitchell: hey.
monica: hi, geoffrey.
rachel: hi.
dr. rosen: ah here, we brought wine.
dr. mitchell: look at this, it's from the cellars of ernest and tova borgnine, so how could we resist?
rachel: oh, that's great. look at that.
dr. rosen: so, monica, how's the ankle?
monica: it's uh... 
monica : ..well, why don't you tell them? after all it, is your ankle.
rachel : you know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay...  stat! (rachel joins monica who is in the kitchen area, opening the wine bottle. rachel checks that the doctors aren't listening, then lowers her voice anyway.)
rachel: okay, listen, i'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? i mean, it'll be fine, i really think it'll be fine.
monica: it will not be fine. we'll get in trouble.
rachel: oh, monica! would you stop being such a wuss?
monica: a wuss? excuse me for living in the real world, okay? 
dr. mitchell: so?
dr. rosen: so... they sss-still seem normal.
dr. mitchell: that's because they are.
dr. rosen:  okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... women we meet at the hospital... it turns into...
dr. mitchell: willya relax? look around. no pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine.  go like this.  
monica: i said we are not going to do it, okay? sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
rachel:  i am not a baby! you know what? i swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
monica: sure, every time, you're such a princess...
rachel: you know what?
monica: what?
rachel: you know what?
monica: what!?
rachel: you know what?
monica:  what!!?
rachel: every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother. (rachel brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute doctors, leaving an open-mouthed monica in her wake.)
rachel: hello! here we go!
dr. rosen: this is a great place. how long have you lived here?
rachel:  thanks! i've been here about six years, and rachel moved in a few months ago.
monica:  ..see, i was supposed to get married, but, um, i left the guy at the altar. 
dr. mitchell: really?
monica:  yeah... yeah, i know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me.  why don't you try the hummus?
dr. rosen: so, monica, what do you do?
rachel:  aahh, i'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
dr. rosen: good for you.
rachel:  yeah it is, mostly because i get to boss people around, which i just love to do.
dr. rosen: this hummus is great.
dr. mitchell: god bless the chickpea.
monica:  oh, god, i am so spoiled... that's it! 
rachel:  and by the way, have i mentioned that back in high school, i was a cow?
monica:  i used to wet my bed.
rachel:  i use my breasts to get other people's attention.
monica:  we both do that! (rachel lets her anger show too. hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses in the vicious pause which follows. the telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. finally both guys jump up, and michael wins.)
dr. mitchell:  monica and rachel's apartment. err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second...  ..ah, rachel, it's your dad.
monica:  hi, dad. no, no, it's me. (getting up to move further away from rachel) li-listen, dad, i can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that i've been meaning to tell you... 
rachel: would you excuse me for a second?
monica:  remember back in freshman year? (talking fast before rachel can catch her) well, billy dreskin and i had sex on your bed. (completely undone by monica's verbal destruction, rachel almost loses her balance as she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned dr. mitchell looks philosophically at dr. rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan altar.) commercial break  round the coffee table, playing scrabble. rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading 
rachel:"  daddy... daddy... daddy, why whyyy would i sleep with billy dreskin? his father tried to put you out of business! (rachel turns to monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so dr.green can't hear, while mouthing ""you are..."") ...dead! (monica smiles a sweet apology of regret, until she's distracted by marcel as he clambers all over her nice furniture.)"
monica: ross, he's got the remote again.
ross: good. maybe he can switch it back. 
ross: maybe not. (meanwhile, rachel has taken another call, from a nurse she'd hoped never to hear from again.)
rachel: hello?  um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at ross who takes the remote from marcel, then turns off the tv) okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here. (all animosity forgotten, rachel holds the receiver out as she limps quickly over to her friend, who stands up in concern.)
rachel: it's the woman from the hospital admissions office. she says there's a problem with the form. oh, god, oh god...
rachel and monica: oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
monica: i don't know! why don't you just explain? what do they want? find out what they want!
rachel: okay  no, you do it.
monica:  hello, this is monica... yeah??? oh... (smiles at rachel to reassure her) okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. thank you. 
rachel: what?
monica: we forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
rachel: ohhh...  okay, you were right. you were right! this was just not worth it.
monica: thank you.
rachel: okay, let me just change.
monica: yes. 
joey:  hey.
ross and chandler: hey!
monica: hi.
phoebe: trouble?
joey: your sister stood me up the other night.
phoebe: oh, no. don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
ross: well did you try calling her?
joey: i've been trying for two days. when i called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. i can't believe she's blowin' me off. (phoebe wants to be angry with joey, but as she watches him shaking his head in pain and disbelief, she knows that it isn't his fault.)  
phoebe: hey. 
ursula: oh!
phoebe: um you, you got a minute?
ursula: um, yeah, i'm just...  ..working. (ursula points out a vacant table, so the twins walk over, side by side, to sit down. departing customers walk right past the pair. sitting at the back, a hungry gentleman looks most annoyed as ursula sets his meal down in front of her. the girls sit.)
phoebe: so.
ursula: uh-huh. (ursula is genuinely pleased that her sister has visited her, after so many years. phoebe hesitates over how best to begin.)
phoebe: um, oh, i got you a birthday present. (ursula picks up a fork and begins eating the meat, while phoebe removes a present from her bag.)
ursula: oh, wow! you remembered!  oh! it's a judy jetson thermos! 
phoebe: right, like the kind you...
ursula: right... oh, i got something for you, too. 
phoebe: how'd you know i was coming?
ursula: um, yeah, um, twin thing. 
phoebe: i can't believe you did this. 
phoebe: i can't believe you...  ..did this. 
phoebe: so... what's the deal with umm, you and joey?
ursula: oh, right. he is so great. but that's over. 
phoebe: does he know?
ursula: who?
phoebe: joey. you know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
ursula: he is? why?
phoebe: you got me.
ursula: right. 
ursula: excuse me. doesn't this come with a side salad? 
phoebe: so, um, are you gonna call him?
ursula: what?  do you think he likes me?
phoebe: no, joey.
ursula: oh. no, no, he is so smart. he'll figure it out. (offering to share her food) do you want some chicken?
phoebe: no. no food with a face.
ursula: you have not changed! 
phoebe: yeah, you too. (trying not to wrinkle her nose, phoebe smiles back realising it's down to her to make up for her negligent sister. meanwhile, ursula still hasn't received her side salad, but when she attempts to attract the waiter's attention, he ignores her.)  monica enter, looking worried. as they approach the desk, rachel adopts a winning smile, 
rachel:  hi, remember us?
nurse:  mmm hmmm.
monica:  um, okay. you just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. well, it turns out we need a whole new one  'cause um...
nurse: you're that stupid.
monica: 
rachel:  yeah, and and, i'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
nurse: well, you know your insurance will cover that.
rachel:  ..i'm i'm just not that bright either.   he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help ross. marcel chitters 
chandler: okay, worst case scenario. say you never feel like a father.
ross: uh-huh.
chandler: say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this.
ross: do you have a point?
chandler: you know, you think i would. (instead of scampering, marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an unvoiced noise from his throat.)
chandler: what's up with the simian?
ross: it's just a fur ball.
chandler: okay...  ..whose turn is it?
ross: yours, i just got 43 points for 'kidney'.
chandler: no, no, you got zero points for 'idney'.
ross: i had a 'k'. where's where's my 'k'? (the unvoiced hissing continues. in alarm, ross and chandler look at the monkey, who is now in some distress.)  at last. ross and chandler hurtle in. little marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled 
ross: you've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'k'! (hearing her brother's voice, monica gets up to stand behind chandler, followed by rachel.)
nurse:  you go get that animal outta here.
ross: no, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking i don't know what else to do.
monica: what's goin' on? 
chandler: marcel swallowed a scrabble tile.
rachel: oh. (..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and ross and chandler whip around once more. monica and rachel recoil slightly.)
nurse: excuse me... this hospital is for people!
ross: lady, he is people. he has a name, okay? he watches jeopardy! he he touches himself when nobody's watching. please, please have a heart! 
dr. mitchell: i'll take a look at him. 
rachel and monica: oh, thank you.
monica: michael.
dr. mitchell: rachel.
rachel: what?
monica:  monica.
rachel:  oh.
monica:  hi.
rachel:  hi.   the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. she hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. nervously, she smooths out the 
phoebe:  hey.
joey: urse... 
joey: ..ah, what're you doing here? i've been trying to call you.
phoebe:  listen, um...
joey:" no, no, no, don't say ""listen."" i know that ""listen."" i've said that ""listen."""
phoebe:  i'm sorry.
joey: i don't get it. what happened? what about everything you said under the bridge? 
phoebe:  you know you, you should just forget about what i said under the bridge, i was talkin' crazy that night, i was so drunk!
joey: you don't drink.
phoebe:  that's right, i don't... but i was, i was drunk on you!
joey: oh, urse... 
phoebe:  okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
joey: why? is it because i'm friends with phoebe?
phoebe:  if it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
joey:  no. no, i, i couldn't do that.
phoebe:  um, then yes, it's 'cause of phoebe! so, you know, it's either her or me.
joey: then, uh, then i'm sorry. (he sinks to the sofa, saddened by ursula's ultimatum, while phoebe follows, touched by joey's good heart.)
phoebe:  you're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
joey: i know... (he looks up at her face and phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him. joey's voice becomes soft and warm.)
joey: i don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
phoebe:" really? (phoebe smiles, when joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. phoebe silently shouts ""oh, whoa!!"" to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. a thoughtful joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various angles, then...)"
joey: pheebs?
phoebe:   anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. ross sits beside him, 
ross: he looks so tiny. 
joey: we just got the message.
phoebe: is he alright?
ross: yeah. the doctor got the 'k' out. he also found an 'm' and an 'o'.
chandler: we think he was trying to spell out 'monkey.' 
ross: well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
chandler:  so, you feel like a dad yet?
ross: no, why?
chandler: hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad. 
monica: oh, look, he's waking up!
ross:  hey, fella! how you doing? (all of a sudden, marcel grabs ross's finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that ross finally knows what it is to be a father. he looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, rachel tenderly resting her chin upon monica's shoulder. ross realises that chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad!) closing credits  of the window and ross is handing out some chinese takeout.  there's a small sap in 
ross: aqui está. 
monica: ¿a quién pidio el pollo general tso? (who ordered general sal's chicken?)
chandler: ¡pudo aver sido general tso!  
rachel: ¡mira, mira, el viejo desnudo está haciendo el hula hoop! (look, look, ugly naked guy is doing the hula!) 
all:¡ewww!  
all: ¡hola, joey! 
joey: ¡hola, amigos!  
monica: mira, ross, marcel se llevo el control remoto. (look, ross, marcel's got the remote.)
