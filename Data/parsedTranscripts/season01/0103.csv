phoebe|  hi guys! 
all| hey, pheebs! hi! 
ross| hey. oh, oh, how'd it go? 
phoebe| um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!' 
all| ohh. ouch. 
rachel| what? he said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
monica| uh, no. loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'. 
rachel| since when? 
joey| since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'. 
chandler| or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
phoebe| or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'. 
rachel| and everybody knows this? 
joey| yeah. cushions the blow. 
chandler| yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
ross| that's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 
monica| uh, ross. 
ross| what? wh- hello? the millners' farm in connecticut? the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....oh my god, chi chi!  opening credits  
chandler|" ""so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"" "
joey|" ""warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."" "
chandler| hey, that was really good! 
joey| thanks! let's keep going. 
chandler|" okay. ""so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?"" "
joey|" ""i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke."" "
chandler|" ""smoke away.""  (joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.  he fumbles and drops the lighter.  then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)"
chandler| i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone. 
joey| what? 
chandler| relax your hand!   
chandler| not so much! 
joey| whoah! 
chandler| hey! 
joey| hey! 
chandler| alright, now try taking a puff.   
chandler| alright.. okay. no. give it to me. 
joey| no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette. 
chandler| it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here.   
chandler| don't think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. when you're holding it, you feel right. you feel complete. 
joey| y'miss it? 
chandler| nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke.  oh.. my.. god.   
monica| no, no, no. they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.   
joey| that's ridiculous! 
ross| can i use.. either thumb? 
rachel|  alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  decaf cappucino for joey.. coffee black.. late.. and an iced tea. i'm getting pretty good at this! 
all| yeah. yeah, excellent. 
rachel|  good for me!  (the gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as phoebe enters.  she sits down without saying hi.)
joey| y'okay, phoebe? 
phoebe| yeah- no- i'm just- it's, i haven't worked- it's my bank. 
monica| what did they do to you? 
phoebe| it's nothing, it's just- okay. i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement- 
ross| easy. 
phoebe| - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
chandler| oh, satan's minions at work again... 
phoebe| yes, 'cause now i have to go down there, and deal with them. 
joey| what are you talking about? keep it! 
phoebe| it's not mine, i didn't earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing. 
rachel| yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 
phoebe| okay. okay, let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what i'd hear, with every step i took? 'not-mine. not-mine. not-mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... 
monica| we're with you. we got it.   
phoebe| okay. i'd- just- i'd never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt. 
rachel| chandler, what are you doing? 
monica|  hey. whaddya doing?  (chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)
all| oh! oh, god! 
ross| what is this?! 
chandler| i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking. 
phoebe| oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years! 
chandler| and this- is my reward! 
ross| hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
chandler| okay, so this time i won't quit! 
all| ohhh! put it out! 
chandler| all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out. (he drops it in phoebe's coffee.) 
phoebe| oh, no! i- i can't drink this now! 
monica| alright. i'm gonna go change, i've got a date. 
rachel| this alan again? how's it goin'? 
monica| 's'going pretty good, y'know? it's nice, and, we're having fun. 
joey| so when do we get to meet the guy? 
monica| let's see, today's monday... never. 
all| oh, come on! come on! 
monica| no. not after what happened with steve. 
chandler| what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry. 
monica| look, i don't even know how i feel about him yet. just give me a chance to figure that out. 
rachel| well, then can we meet him? 
monica| nope. schhorry.  
monica| i mean, why should i let them meet him? i mean, i bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. i mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. 
paula| listen. as someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, i'll
tell you| that is not such a terrible thing. i mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. 
monica| i know. i just wish that once, i'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. 
paula| well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..  
joey| let it go, ross. 
ross| yeah, well, you didn't know chi chi. 
monica| do you all promise? 
all| yeah! we promise! we'll be good! 
monica|  chandler? do you promise to be good?  (chandler makes a 'cross my heart' sign.  it starts to rain and he taps on the window.)
joey| you can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!   (phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)
ross| hey, pheebs. 
phoebe| 'dear ms. buffay. thank you for calling attention to our error. we have credited your account with five hundred dollars. we're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' do you believe this?! now i have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 
rachel| what bank is this?   
monica| hey. it's him.  who is it? 
alan|  it's alan. 
joey|  chandler! he's here!   
monica|  okay, please be good, please. just remember how much you all like me.   
monica| hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan. 
alan| hi. 
all| hi, alan. 
alan| i've heard schho much about all you guyschh!   
monica|  okay. okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin. who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?   
monica| c'mon! 
ross| ...i'll go. let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, i'm sorry, i can't do this, can't do this. we loved him. 
all| loved him! yeah! he's great! 
monica| wait a minute! we're talking about someone that i'm going out with? 
all| yeah! 
rachel| and did you notice...?  
the guys|  yeah. 
joey| know what was great? the way his smile was kinda crooked. 
phoebe| yes, yes! like the man in the shoe! 
ross| ...what shoe? 
phoebe| from the nursery rhyme. 'there was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile, who lived in a shoe, for a... while...'   
ross| ...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 
rachel| what future boyfriends? nono, i th- i think this could be, y'know, it. 
monica| really! 
chandler| oh, yeah. i'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  
ross| you know what i like most about him, though? 
all| what? 
ross| the way he makes me feel about myself. 
all| yeah...  commercial break    
monica| hi.. how was the game? 
ross| well.. 
all| we won!! thank you! yes! 
monica| fantastic! i have one question: how is that possible? 
joey| alan. 
ross| he was unbelievable. he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first base-alan, second base-alan, third base-... 
rachel| i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
chandler| yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 
monica| can i ask you guys a question? d'you ever think that alan is maybe.. sometimes.. 
ross| what? 
monica| ..i dunno, a little too alan? 
rachel| well, no. that's impossible. you can never be too alan. 
ross| yeah, it's his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
chandler| i personally could have a gallon of alan.  
phoebe| hey, lizzie. 
lizzie| hey, weird girl. 
phoebe| i brought you alphabet soup. 
lizzie| did you pick out the vowels? 
phoebe|" yes. but i left in the ys. 'cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". uh, i also have something else for you.  "
lizzie| saltines? 
phoebe| no, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 
lizzie| what?  oh my god, there's really money in here. 
phoebe| i know. 
lizzie| weird girl, what are you doing? 
phoebe| no, i want you to have it. i don't want it. 
lizzie| no, no, i ha-i have to give you something. 
phoebe| oh, that's fine, no. 
lizzie| would you like my tin-foil hat? 
phoebe| no. 'cause you need that. no, it's okay, thanks. 
lizzie| please, let me do something. 
phoebe| okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. okay? 
lizzie| okay. 
phoebe| okay.   of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  he types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.   while not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a  
lizzie| keep the change.  sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
phoebe| no, i'm fine. 
lizzie|  see ya.   
phoebe| huh!  
ross| a thumb?!   
all| eww! 
phoebe| i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
chandler| well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five? 
phoebe| does, um, anyone wanna see? 
all| nooo!  
all| oh, hey, don't do that! cut it out! 
rachel| it's worse than the thumb! 
chandler| hey, this is so unfair! 
monica| oh, why is it unfair? 
chandler| so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?  
joey| ...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
rachel| well, i-i could live without it. 
joey| well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?  
ross| oh, now, don't listen to him, pheebs, i think it's endearing. 
joey|" oh,  ""you do, do you""?   "
ross| you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
rachel|" ""indeed there isn't""... i should really get back to work. "
phoebe| yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 
rachel| ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on.   
monica| did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
paula| no. 
monica| okay.. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 
paula| waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? all right, a cow got through! 
monica| can you believe it? ...y'know what? i just don't feel the thing. i mean, they feel the thing, i don't feel the thing. 
paula| honey.. you should always feel the thing. listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him! 
monica| i know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
paula| well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. 
monica| no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about.  
joey| do you have any respect for your body? 
ross| don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
chandler| hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
rachel|  chandler? it's alan, he wants to speak to you. 
chandler| really? he does?  hey, buddy, what's up! oh, she told you about that, huh. well, yeah, i have one now and then. well, yeah, now. well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. well, okay, thanks!  
rachel|  god, he's good. 
ross| if only he were a woman. 
rachel| yeah.   
chandler| ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 
ross| okay. i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.  
monica|  hey. where's joey? 
chandler| joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong? 
rachel| i think he's across the hall. 
monica| thanks.  
ross|  there y'go. 
chandler|  ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now. 
ross| hey pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that pop-tart?.. pheebs? 
phoebe| does anyone want the rest of this pop-tart? 
ross| hey, i might! 
phoebe| sorry. ..y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 
all| you're kidding. oh my god. 
phoebe| and on my way over here, i stepped in gum. ...what is up with the universe?! 
joey|  what's going on? 
monica| nothing. i just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
joey| even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
rachel| uh, joey.. 
joey| oh, god!  
monica|  okay.. 
all| oh! that was lambchop! 
monica| please, guys, we have to talk. 
phoebe| wait, wait, i'm getting a deja vu...no, i'm not. 
monica| alright, we have to talk. 
phoebe| there it is! 
monica| okay. it's-it's about alan. there's something that you should know. i mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. i've decided to break up with alan.  
ross| is there somebody else? 
monica| no, nononono.. it's just.. things change. people change. 
rachel| we didn't change.. 
joey| so that's it? it's over? just like that? 
phoebe| you know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and i just- i-  
monica| look, i- i could go on pretending- 
joey| okay! 
monica| -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to alan- it wouldn't be fair to you! 
ross| who-who wants fair? y'know, i just want things back. y'know, the way they were. 
monica| i'm sorry.. 
chandler|  oh, she's sorry! i feel better! 
rachel|  i just can't believe this! i mean, with the holidays coming up- i wanted him to meet my family- 
monica| i'll meet somone else. there'll be other alans. 
all| oh, yeah! right! 
monica| are you guys gonna be okay? 
ross| hey hey, we'll be fine. we're just gonna need a little time. 
monica|  i understand.  
alan| wow. 
monica| i'm, i'm really sorry. 
alan| yeah, i'm sorry too. but, i gotta tell you, i am a little relieved. 
monica| relieved? 
alan| yeah, well, i had a great time with you.. i just can't stand your friends.  closing credits  
rachel| remember when we went to central park and rented boats?.. that was fun. 
ross| yeah. he could row like a viking. 
monica|  hi. 
all| mmm. 
ross| so how'd it go? 
monica| oh, y'know.. 
phoebe| did he mention us? 
monica| he said he's really gonna miss you guys.  
ross| you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (she sits down and ross strokes her forehead.) 
chandler| ...that's it. i'm getting cigarettes. 
all| no no no! 
chandler|  i don't care, i don't care! game's over! i'm weak! i've gotta smoke! i've gotta have the smoke! 
phoebe|  if you never smoke again i'll give you seven thousand dollars!
