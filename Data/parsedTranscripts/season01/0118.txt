ROSS:

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 there was chocolate on the three. it looked like an eight, alright?

ROSS:
 oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'read 'em and weep.'

CHANDLER:
 and then he did.

RACHEL:
 well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, what is that? like, some kind of guy thing? like, some kind of sexist guy thing? like it's poker, so only guys can play?

ROSS:
 no, women are welcome to play.

PHOEBE:
 oh, ok, so then what is it? some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?

CHANDLER:
 there just don't happen to be any women in our games.

JOEY:
 yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.

GIRLS:
 oh, yeah, right.

MONICA:
 oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!

RACHEL:
 really.

MONICA:
 i mean, that's a typical guy response.

ROSS:
 excuse me, do any of you know how to play?

GIRLS:
 no.

RACHEL:
 but you could teach us.

GUYS:
 no. 

CHANDLER:
  ok, so now we draw cards.

MONICA:
 so i wouldn't need any, right? cause i have a straight.

RACHEL:
 oh, good for you!

PHOEBE:
 congratulations! 

CHANDLER:
 ok phoebs, how many do you want?

PHOEBE:
 ok, i just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh wait, i have the ten of spades! here!  

ROSS:
 no, no. uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.

RACHEL:
 oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's ok, i don't need them. i'm going for fours.

ROSS:
 oh, you're...  

MONICA:
 alright, here we go. we've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.

PHOEBE AND RACHEL:
 ooooooo!

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, monica, what're you doin'? this is a poker game. you can't serve food with more than one syllable. it's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...

CHANDLER:
  ok, so at this point, the dealer...

MONICA:
 alright, you know, we got it, we got it. let's play for real. high stakes... big bucks...

ROSS:
 alright, now, you sure? phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...

PHOEBE:
 but... i'm ready, so, just deal.

CHANDLER:
 ok, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) joey... three... eight. eight... three.  alright babe, deal the cards. 

MONICA:
  dammit, dammit, dammit!

PHOEBE:
 : oh i see, so then, you were lying.

JOEY:
 about what?

PHOEBE:
 about how good your cards were.

JOEY:
 heh... i was bluffing.

PHOEBE:
 a-ha! and... what is bluffing? is it not another word for... lying?

RACHEL:
 ok, sorry to break up this party, but i've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... 

GUYS:
 whoa, whoa, whoa!

CHANDLER:
 rach, rach, we gotta settle.

RACHEL:
 settle what?

CHANDLER:
 the... jamestown colony of virginia. you see, king george is giving us the land, so...

ROSS:
 the game, rachel, the game. you owe us money for the game.

RACHEL:
 oh. right.

JOEY:
 you know what, you guys? it's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?

MONICA:
 hell no, we'll pay!

PHOEBE:
 ok, monica? i had another answer all ready.

MONICA:
 and you know what? we want a rematch.

ROSS:
 well that's fine with me. could use the money.

RACHEL:
 : so basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.

ROSS:
 ...yeah.

CHANDLER:
 yes, and i get my ya-yas from ikea. you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.

ROSS:
 look, rachel, this is poker. i play to win, alright? in order for me to win, other people have to lose. so if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' ok? cause once those cards are dealt... 

JOEY:
 ...yeah?

ROSS:
 i'm not a nice guy. 

ROSS:
 alright boys, let's eat.

CHANDLER:
 oh, did you get that from the 'i love rachel' pizzeria?

ROSS:
 you still on that?

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on. what was with that whole black bart speech? : "when i play poker, i'm not a nice guy!"

ROSS:
 you are way off, pal.

JOEY:
 no, i don't think so, see ross, because i think you love her.

ROSS:
 um.... no. see, i might've had feelings for her at one time—not any more. i just—i... 

ROSS:
 marcel! where are you going with that disc? 

ROSS:
 you are not putting that on again! marcel, ok—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.  

RACHEL:
  can you believe what a jerk ross was being?

MONICA:
 yeah, i know. he can get really competitive.

PHOEBE:
 ha. ha, ha.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh, hello, kettle? this is monica. you're black.

MONICA:
 please! i am not as bad as ross.

RACHEL:
 oh, i beg to differ. the pictionary incident?

MONICA:
 that was not an incident! i-i was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.

RACHEL:
 oooooh. : oh! i got an interview! i got an interview!

MONICA:
 you're kidding! where? where?

RACHEL:
 : sak's... fifth... avenue.

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

AUNT IRIS:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

AUNT IRIS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

AUNT IRIS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending trident?

RACHEL:

ALL:

RACHEL:
 oh god, oh, and then she told the funniest story...

MONICA:
 ok, great. you'll tell us and we'll laugh. let's play poker.

JOEY:
 alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.

CHANDLER:
 oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, i don't know... pictionary? 

MONICA:
 ha, ha, very funny, very funny. but i think we'd like to give poker another try. shall we, ladies?

PHOEBE AND RACHEL:
 yes, we should. i think we should.

ROSS:
 uh, rach, do you want me to shuffle those?

RACHEL:
 no, no, thats ok. y'know, i think i'm gonna give it a go.

ROSS:
 alright.

RACHEL:
 alright...  commercial break 

ROSS:
 so, phoebs owes $7.50, monica, you owe $10, and rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.

JOEY:
 but hey, thanks for teachin' us cross-eyed mary. you guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.

PHOEBE:
 alright, here's my $7.50.  but i think you should know that this money is cursed.

JOEY:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i cursed it. so now bad things will happen to he who spends it.

CHANDLER:
 that's alright, i'll take it. bad things happen to me anyway. this way i can break 'em up with a movie.

ROSS:
 well, that just leaves the big green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

RACHEL:
 mmm-hmmm. oh, so typical. ooo, i'm a man. ooo, i have a penis. ooo, i have to win money to exert my power over women. 

MONICA:
 you know what? this is not over. we will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.

RACHEL:
 hmm. kinda stepped on my point there, mon. 

ROSS:
 so, you gals wanna hand over your money now? that way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.

RACHEL:
 ooooh, that's fine. we'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

MONICA:
 ok, we done with the chit-chat? are we ready to play some serious poker?

PHOEBE:
  hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever i go.  right, ok, serious poker. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:
