CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

GIRLS:
 oh, yeah, right.

MONICA:
 oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 i mean, that's a typical guy response.

ROSS:
 excuse me, do any of you know how to play?

GIRLS:
 no.

RACHEL:
 but you could teach us.

GUYS:
 no. 

CHANDLER:
  ok, so now we draw cards.

ROSS:

MONICA:

PHOEBE AND RACHEL:
 ooooooo!

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, monica, what're you doin'? this is a poker game. you can't serve food with more than one syllable. it's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...

CHANDLER:
  ok, so at this point, the dealer...

MONICA:
 alright, you know, we got it, we got it. let's play for real. high stakes... big bucks...

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
  dammit, dammit, dammit!

PHOEBE:
 : oh i see, so then, you were lying.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 about how good your cards were.

JOEY:
 heh... i was bluffing.

PHOEBE:
 a-ha! and... what is bluffing? is it not another word for... lying?

RACHEL:

GUYS:
 whoa, whoa, whoa!

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 the game, rachel, the game. you owe us money for the game.

RACHEL:
 oh. right.

JOEY:
 you know what, you guys? it's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?

MONICA:
 hell no, we'll pay!

PHOEBE:
 ok, monica? i had another answer all ready.

MONICA:
 and you know what? we want a rematch.

ROSS:
 well that's fine with me. could use the money.

RACHEL:
 : so basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.

ROSS:
 ...yeah.

CHANDLER:
 yes, and i get my ya-yas from ikea. you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.

ROSS:
 look, rachel, this is poker. i play to win, alright? in order for me to win, other people have to lose. so if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' ok? cause once those cards are dealt... 

JOEY:
 ...yeah?

ROSS:
 i'm not a nice guy. 

ROSS:
 alright boys, let's eat.

CHANDLER:
 oh, did you get that from the 'i love rachel' pizzeria?

ROSS:
 you still on that?

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on. what was with that whole black bart speech? : "when i play poker, i'm not a nice guy!"

ROSS:
 you are way off, pal.

JOEY:
 no, i don't think so, see ross, because i think you love her.

ROSS:
 um.... no. see, i might've had feelings for her at one time듩ot any more. i just들... 

ROSS:
 marcel! where are you going with that disc? 

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh, hello, kettle? this is monica. you're black.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 alright, here's my $7.50.  but i think you should know that this money is cursed.

JOEY:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i cursed it. so now bad things will happen to he who spends it.

CHANDLER:
 that's alright, i'll take it. bad things happen to me anyway. this way i can break 'em up with a movie.

ROSS:
 well, that just leaves the big green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

RACHEL:
 mmm-hmmm. oh, so typical. ooo, i'm a man. ooo, i have a penis. ooo, i have to win money to exert my power over women. 

MONICA:
 you know what? this is not over. we will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.

RACHEL:
 hmm. kinda stepped on my point there, mon. 

ROSS:
 so, you gals wanna hand over your money now? that way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.

RACHEL:
 ooooh, that's fine. we'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

MONICA:
