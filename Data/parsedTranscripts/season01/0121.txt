JOEY:
 how could someone get a hold of your credit card number?

MONICA:
 i have no idea. but look how much they spent!

RACHEL:
 monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.

MONICA:
 i know. it's just such reckless spending.

ROSS:
 i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.

CHANDLER:
 wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.

MONICA:
 that's me.

PHOEBE:
 oh! the yuk! ross, he's doing it again! (points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)

ROSS:
 marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back-  come here, marcel-

RACHEL:
 oh no, not in my room! i'll get him.

MONICA:
 ross, you've got to do something about the humping.

ROSS:
 what? it's, it's just a phase.

CHANDLER:
 well, that's what we said about joey...

ROSS:
 would you all relax? it's not that big a deal.

RACHEL:
  stop it! marcel! bad monkey!

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 let's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious. opening credits  

RACHEL:
 oh, monica. you are not still going over that thing.

MONICA:
 this woman's living my life.

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! look at this, look. she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see. she, she buys clothes from stores that i'm intimidated by the sales people. she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.

RACHEL:
 you're not an artist.

MONICA:
 yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't.

RACHEL:
 oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things.

MONICA:
 oh really? okay, let's compare, shall we.

RACHEL:
  oh, it's so late for 'shall we'...

MONICA:
 do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school?

RACHEL:
  nooo...

MONICA:
 this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother. 

CHANDLER:
 how about joey... pepponi?

JOEY:
 no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.

CHANDLER:
 joey... switzerland? 

JOEY:
 plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big.  which i'm not.

CHANDLER:
 joe...joe...joe...stalin?

JOEY:
 stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.

CHANDLER:
 well, it does not ring a bell with me...

JOEY:
  joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good.

CHANDLER:
 might wanna try joseph. 

JOEY:
 joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that!

CHANDLER:
 oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof. 

RACHEL:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hi.  hi, uh, yes, this is monica geller. um, i believe i'm taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were.

PHOEBE:
 what are you doing?

MONICA:
  i'm going to tap class.

RACHEL:
 what, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?

MONICA:
 this woman's got my life, i should get to see who she is.

RACHEL:
 go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up! ...okay, monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! i mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.

PHOEBE:
 this is madness. it's madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, don't do it!! ...thank you. 

MONICA:
 what d'you think?

PHOEBE:
 lotsa things. 

RACHEL:
 which one do you think she is? 

TEACHER:
 may i help you?

MONICA:
 oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.

TEACHER:
 you don't observe a dance class. you dance a dance class. spare shoes are over there.

RACHEL:
 what does she mean?

PHOEBE:
 i think she means  'you dance a dance class'. oh, c'mon, c'mon. (they put on some spare shoes)

MONICA:
 okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?

TEACHER:
  people! last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. let's not have that happen again!

RACHEL:
 she could be you. 

TEACHER:
 let's get started. five, six, a-five six seven eight... 

MONICA:
 okay, i'm not getting this!

PHOEBE:
  i'm totally getting it!

MONICA:
 did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? 

RACHEL:
 what? you just click when they click.

TEACHER:
 alright people, now everyone grab a partner. 

PHOEBE:
 okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. i'm with rachel.

MONICA:
 great. it's gym class all over again.

PHOEBE AND RACHEL:
 aww.

TEACHER:
 well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.

MONICA:
 why don't i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. (she starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. the teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. suddenly a woman bursts in)

WOMAN:
 it's okay, it's okay, i'm here, i'm here. sorry i'm late, okay, here i am. who's the new tense girl?

TEACHER:
 she's your partner.

WOMAN:
 hi. i'm monica.

MONICA:
 oh. monica! ...hi. i'm mo- ...nana.

WOMAN:
  monana?

MONICA:
 yeah. it's dutch.

FAKE MONICA:
 you're kidding! i-i spent three years in amsterdam. (asks her something in dutch)

MONICA:
 um, pennsylvania dutch.

TEACHER:
 and we're dancing. a-five, six, seven, eight... 

ROSS:
  hi.

CHANDLER AND JOEY:
 hey.

JOEY:
 where've you been?

ROSS:
 at the vet.

CHANDLER:
 she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?

ROSS:
 she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he's reached sexual maturity.

JOEY:
  hey! he beat ya.

ROSS:
 she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.

CHANDLER:
 so what does this mean?

ROSS:
 i'm gonna have to give him up. commercial break  

JOEY:
 i can't believe it, ross. this sucks!

CHANDLER:
 i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?

ROSS:
 i know. i know. i mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg.

JOEY:
 isn't there any way you can keep him?

ROSS:
 no, no. the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. i've just gotta get him into a zoo.

JOEY:
 how do you get a monkey into a zoo?

CHANDLER:
 i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen.

ROSS:
 well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo. 

PHOEBE:
 hey. we found her, we found the girl.

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 did you call the cops?

RACHEL:
 nope. we took her to lunch.

CHANDLER:
 ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.

ROSS:
 what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she's a stealer.

MONICA:
 y'know what? after you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.

ROSS:
 yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.

CHANDLER:
 ...take off their hats!

PHOEBE:
 popes in a volkswagen! ...i love that joke. 

RACHEL:
 no way. no way did you do this.

FAKE MONICA:
 monana was very brave.

MONICA:
 it was so wild. we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen. only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!

FAKE MONICA:
 so once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...

MONICA:
 ...they threw us out! i was thrown out of a hotel! me!

RACHEL:
 go monana! well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up. 

FAKE MONICA:
 oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show.

MONICA:
 'scuse me?

FAKE MONICA:
 there's an open call for cats. i'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say?

MONICA:
 nononononono. think who you're dealing with here. i mean, i'm not like you. i-i can't even stand in front of a tap class.

FAKE MONICA:
 well, that's just probably 'cause of your amish background.

MONICA:
 what?

FAKE MONICA:
 well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right?

MONICA:
 right. till i bought a blow dryer, then i was shunned.

FAKE MONICA:
 i-i used to be just like you. and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life. did you ever see dead poets' society?

MONICA:
 uh-huh.

FAKE MONICA:
 i thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? what was that?! it's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, 'now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back.' and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do.

MONICA:
 wow. then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire. 

ROSS:
  we didn't get into scranton. (to the others) that was like our safety zoo. they take like dogs and cows. see? i don't know who this is harder on, me or him.

PHOEBE:
 i'd say that chair's taking the brunt.

ROSS:
 marcel! marcel! marcel, no! good boy. see, how can nobody want him?

RACHEL:
 oh, somebody will.

JOEY:
  you know there already is a joseph stalin?

CHANDLER:
 you're kidding.

JOEY:
 apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that!

CHANDLER:
 y'know, you'd think i would've.

JOEY:
 phoebe. whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?

PHOEBE:
 ...flame boy. 

ROSS:
 where exactly is your zoo?

DR. BALDHARA:
 well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel?

ROSS:
 yes.

DR. BALDHARA:
 does he, uh, fight with other animals?

ROSS:
 no-no, he's, he's very docile.

DR. BALDHARA:
 even if he were... cornered?

ROSS:
 well i, i don't know. why?

DR. BALDHARA:
 uh, how is he at handling small objects?

ROSS:
 he can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...

DR. BALDHARA:
 how about a hammer, or a small blade?

ROSS:
 why- why- why would he need a blade?

DR. BALDHARA:
 well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. otherwise it's just cruel. 

CHANDLER AND JOEY:
 he- he- he got in, he- he got in to san diego.

JOEY:
 we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...

CHANDLER:
 ...he's in.

ROSS:
 he's in! oh, did you hear that, marcel? san diego. san diego!

DR. BALDHARA:
 you're making a big mistake here. i mean, san diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, i'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.  magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. monica bursts in, 

MONICA:
 yo- hooo!

RACHEL:
 where the hell've you been?

MONICA:
 monica and i just crashed an embassy party.

RACHEL:
 are you drunk?!

MONICA:
 noooo!  i'm lying. i am so drunk.

RACHEL:
 oh god, oh. great, monica, y'know what, you could've called, i have been up here, i've been worried... 

RACHEL:
 monica? monica!

MONICA:
 water rules!

RACHEL:
 yes, yes, it does. okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?

MONICA:
 nope. going to the big apple circus today.

RACHEL:
 okay monica, what are you doing? you're gonna lose your job! this is not you!

MONICA:
 no, it is me! y'know, i'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! y'know, when i'm with her, i am so much more than that. i'm- i'm monana! 

RACHEL:
 hello? yes, she is, hold on a second, please. monana, it's for you, the credit card people.

MONICA:
 helloooo? yeah. oh my god. thanks.

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 they've arrested monica. 

MONICA:
 hi.

FAKE MONICA:
 hey.

MONICA:
 how are you?

FAKE MONICA:
 i'm not too bad. fortunately, blue's my colour. how-how did you know i was here?

MONICA:
 because... i'm monica geller. it was my credit card you were using.

FAKE MONICA:
 that i was not expecting.

MONICA:
 i want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.

FAKE MONICA:
 oh. thanks.

MONICA:
 no, thank you! you have given me so much! i mean, if it wasn't for you, i would never have gotten to sing memories on the stage at the wintergarden theater!

FAKE MONICA:
 well, actually, you only got to sing 'memo-'.

MONICA:
 i just can't believe you're in here. i mean, what am i gonna do without you? who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? who's gonna take me to the big apple circus?

FAKE MONICA:
 monica, i started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus?

MONICA:
 well, not... worried, just... wondering.

FAKE MONICA:
 there's nothing to wonder about, monica. you're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.

MONICA:
 not necessarily...

FAKE MONICA:
 yes necessarily! i mean, i dunno what it is, maybe it's the amish thing.

MONICA:
 um, i'm not actually amish.

FAKE MONICA:
 really? then why are you like that? 

TEACHER:
 you by the door. in or out?

MONICA:
 in. 

TEACHER:
 you in the back, you're getting it all wrong!

MONICA:
 yeah, but at least i'm doing it! 

PA:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 uh, if you guys don't mind, i'd like to take a moment, just me and him.

ALL:
 oh, sure. sure, absolutely. (they just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)

ROSS:
 marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (he sits down and marcel jumps down and sits beside him) well buddy, this is it. there's just a coupla things i want to say. i'm really gonna miss you, and i'm never gonna forget about you. you've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  okay, marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! marcel, would- okay, just take him away. just take him.  closing credits
