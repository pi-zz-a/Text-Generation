PHOEBE:
 i could do that. 

RACHEL:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 no, i didn't tell anybody that i knew you.

CHANDLER:
 why not?

PHOEBE:
 oh, because, you know... they don't like you.

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 i thought you knew that.

CHANDLER:
 noho. who doesn't they like me?

PHOEBE:
 everyone. except for uh... no everyone.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 i can't belive it.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, yeah. they even do you.

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 'the hills were alive with the sound of music.' 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 that is so not... that is so not... that... oh, shut up!  

MONICA:

YOUNG ETHAN:
 i am telling you, up until i was, like nine, i thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.

MONICA:
 how was that possible?

YOUNG ETHAN:
 well, think about it. it's always on the news. 'a man is being held

UP, AT GUNPOINT.' 'TOURISTS ARE BEING TERRORISED, AT GUNPOINT.' AND I JUST KEPT THINKING:
 why does people continue to go there?  oh, ah. i should go.

MONICA:
 okay. 

YOUNG ETHAN:
 okay.

MONICA:
 unless...

YOUNG ETHAN:
 what?

MONICA:
 uh, ah. unless you wanna stay over? i mean, i'm going to, so...

YOUNG ETHAN:
 yeah, i'd really like that. 

YOUNG ETHAN:
 uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.

MONICA:
 okay, is this like 'i have an early class tomorrow' or 'i'm secretly married to a goat?'

YOUNG ETHAN:
 well it's somewhere in between. you see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, i'm not uh..., well i, i mean i haven't ever uh...

MONICA:
 ethan?

YOUNG ETHAN:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 are you a virgin?

YOUNG ETHAN:
 well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes i am. i uh, i've kinda been waiting for the right person.

MONICA:
 really?

YOUNG ETHAN:
 yeah. you do know i was talking about you, right?  

YOUNG ETHAN:
 wow!

MONICA:
 you keep saying that.

YOUNG ETHAN:
 you know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. 

MONICA:
 listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. and i, i-i figured if you could be honest, then i can to.

YOUNG ETHAN:
 oh god, don't tell me, i did it wrong.

MONICA:
 no-no. nothing wrong about that. 

YOUNG ETHAN:
 oh.

MONICA:
 um, okay, here it goes. i'm not 22. i'm, i'm 25... and thirteen months. 

YOUNG ETHAN:
 huh!

MONICA:
 but i figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. i mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. 

YOUNG ETHAN:
 uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, i have another one for you. i'm a little younger than i said.

MONICA:
 you're not a senior?

YOUNG ETHAN:
 oh, i'm a senior... in high school.

MONICA:
 ok...ay. commercial break 

MONICA:
 what we did was wrong. oh god, i just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

YOUNG ETHAN:
 i just had sex.

MONICA:
 ethan, focus. how could you not tell me?

YOUNG ETHAN:
 well, you never told me how old you were.

MONICA:
 well, that's different. my lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. what were you thinking?

YOUNG ETHAN:
 i wasn't thinking. i was too busy fallin'...

MONICA:
 don't say it. 

YOUNG ETHAN:
 ...in love with you.

MONICA:

YOUNG ETHAN:
  sorry.

MONICA:
 well,fall out of it. you know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. oh god, oh god. i'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named chad. i'm joan collins.

YOUNG ETHAN:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

YOUNG ETHAN:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

YOUNG ETHAN:

MONICA:

YOUNG ETHAN:

MONICA:
 ethan, it's um... it's icky.

YOUNG ETHAN:
 icky? you're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?

MONICA:
 this isn't easy for me either. i wish things were different, i... if you were a few years older, or if i was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, i would really...

YOUNG ETHAN:
 no, don't say it. 

MONICA:
