joey| how could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
monica| i have no idea. but look how much they spent!
rachel| monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
monica| i know. it's just such reckless spending.
ross| i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
chandler| wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.
monica| that's me.
phoebe| oh! the yuk! ross, he's doing it again! (points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)
ross| marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back-  come here, marcel-
rachel| oh no, not in my room! i'll get him.
monica| ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
ross| what? it's, it's just a phase.
chandler| well, that's what we said about joey...
ross| would you all relax? it's not that big a deal.
rachel|  stop it! marcel! bad monkey!
ross| what?
rachel| let's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious. opening credits  
rachel| oh, monica. you are not still going over that thing.
monica| this woman's living my life.
rachel| what?
monica| she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! look at this, look. she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see. she, she buys clothes from stores that i'm intimidated by the sales people. she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
rachel| you're not an artist.
monica| yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't.
rachel| oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
monica| oh really? okay, let's compare, shall we.
rachel|  oh, it's so late for 'shall we'...
monica| do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school?
rachel|  nooo...
monica| this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother. 
chandler| how about joey... pepponi?
joey| no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.
chandler| joey... switzerland? 
joey| plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big.  which i'm not.
chandler| joe...joe...joe...stalin?
joey| stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.
chandler| well, it does not ring a bell with me...
joey|  joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good.
chandler| might wanna try joseph. 
joey| joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that!
chandler| oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof. 
rachel| hey.
phoebe| hey.
monica| hi.  hi, uh, yes, this is monica geller. um, i believe i'm taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were.
phoebe| what are you doing?
monica|  i'm going to tap class.
rachel| what, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
monica| this woman's got my life, i should get to see who she is.
rachel| go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up! ...okay, monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! i mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
phoebe| this is madness. it's madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, don't do it!! ...thank you. 
monica| what d'you think?
phoebe| lotsa things. 
rachel| which one do you think she is? 
teacher| may i help you?
monica| oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
teacher| you don't observe a dance class. you dance a dance class. spare shoes are over there.
rachel| what does she mean?
phoebe| i think she means  'you dance a dance class'. oh, c'mon, c'mon. (they put on some spare shoes)
monica| okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
teacher|  people! last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. let's not have that happen again!
rachel| she could be you. 
teacher| let's get started. five, six, a-five six seven eight... 
monica| okay, i'm not getting this!
phoebe|  i'm totally getting it!
monica| did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? 
rachel| what? you just click when they click.
teacher| alright people, now everyone grab a partner. 
phoebe| okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. i'm with rachel.
monica| great. it's gym class all over again.
phoebe and rachel| aww.
teacher| well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
monica| why don't i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. (she starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. the teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. suddenly a woman bursts in)
woman| it's okay, it's okay, i'm here, i'm here. sorry i'm late, okay, here i am. who's the new tense girl?
teacher| she's your partner.
woman| hi. i'm monica.
monica| oh. monica! ...hi. i'm mo- ...nana.
woman|  monana?
monica| yeah. it's dutch.
fake monica| you're kidding! i-i spent three years in amsterdam. (asks her something in dutch)
monica| um, pennsylvania dutch.
teacher| and we're dancing. a-five, six, seven, eight... 
ross|  hi.
chandler and joey| hey.
joey| where've you been?
ross| at the vet.
chandler| she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
ross| she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
joey|  hey! he beat ya.
ross| she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
chandler| so what does this mean?
ross| i'm gonna have to give him up. commercial break  
joey| i can't believe it, ross. this sucks!
chandler| i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?
ross| i know. i know. i mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg.
joey| isn't there any way you can keep him?
ross| no, no. the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. i've just gotta get him into a zoo.
joey| how do you get a monkey into a zoo?
chandler| i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen.
ross| well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility.
chandler| yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo. 
phoebe| hey. we found her, we found the girl.
chandler| what?
joey| did you call the cops?
rachel| nope. we took her to lunch.
chandler| ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
ross| what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she's a stealer.
monica| y'know what? after you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
ross| yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
chandler| ...take off their hats!
phoebe| popes in a volkswagen! ...i love that joke. 
rachel| no way. no way did you do this.
fake monica| monana was very brave.
monica| it was so wild. we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen. only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
fake monica| so once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
monica| ...they threw us out! i was thrown out of a hotel! me!
rachel| go monana! well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up. 
fake monica| oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show.
monica| 'scuse me?
fake monica| there's an open call for cats. i'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say?
monica| nononononono. think who you're dealing with here. i mean, i'm not like you. i-i can't even stand in front of a tap class.
fake monica| well, that's just probably 'cause of your amish background.
monica| what?
fake monica| well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right?
monica| right. till i bought a blow dryer, then i was shunned.
fake monica| i-i used to be just like you. and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life. did you ever see dead poets' society?
monica| uh-huh.
fake monica| i thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? what was that?! it's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, 'now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back.' and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do.
monica| wow. then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire. 
ross|  we didn't get into scranton. (to the others) that was like our safety zoo. they take like dogs and cows. see? i don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
phoebe| i'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
ross| marcel! marcel! marcel, no! good boy. see, how can nobody want him?
rachel| oh, somebody will.
joey|  you know there already is a joseph stalin?
chandler| you're kidding.
joey| apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that!
chandler| y'know, you'd think i would've.
joey| phoebe. whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
phoebe| ...flame boy. 
ross| where exactly is your zoo?
dr. baldhara| well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel?
ross| yes.
dr. baldhara| does he, uh, fight with other animals?
ross| no-no, he's, he's very docile.
dr. baldhara| even if he were... cornered?
ross| well i, i don't know. why?
dr. baldhara| uh, how is he at handling small objects?
ross| he can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
dr. baldhara| how about a hammer, or a small blade?
ross| why- why- why would he need a blade?
dr. baldhara| well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. otherwise it's just cruel. 
chandler and joey| he- he- he got in, he- he got in to san diego.
joey| we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
chandler| ...he's in.
ross| he's in! oh, did you hear that, marcel? san diego. san diego!
dr. baldhara| you're making a big mistake here. i mean, san diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, i'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.  magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. monica bursts in, 
monica| yo- hooo!
rachel| where the hell've you been?
monica| monica and i just crashed an embassy party.
rachel| are you drunk?!
monica| noooo!  i'm lying. i am so drunk.
rachel| oh god, oh. great, monica, y'know what, you could've called, i have been up here, i've been worried... 
rachel| monica? monica!
monica| water rules!
rachel| yes, yes, it does. okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
monica| nope. going to the big apple circus today.
rachel| okay monica, what are you doing? you're gonna lose your job! this is not you!
monica| no, it is me! y'know, i'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! y'know, when i'm with her, i am so much more than that. i'm- i'm monana! 
rachel| hello? yes, she is, hold on a second, please. monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
monica| helloooo? yeah. oh my god. thanks.
rachel| what?
monica| they've arrested monica. 
monica| hi.
fake monica| hey.
monica| how are you?
fake monica| i'm not too bad. fortunately, blue's my colour. how-how did you know i was here?
monica| because... i'm monica geller. it was my credit card you were using.
fake monica| that i was not expecting.
monica| i want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
fake monica| oh. thanks.
monica| no, thank you! you have given me so much! i mean, if it wasn't for you, i would never have gotten to sing memories on the stage at the wintergarden theater!
fake monica| well, actually, you only got to sing 'memo-'.
monica| i just can't believe you're in here. i mean, what am i gonna do without you? who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? who's gonna take me to the big apple circus?
fake monica| monica, i started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus?
monica| well, not... worried, just... wondering.
fake monica| there's nothing to wonder about, monica. you're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
monica| not necessarily...
fake monica| yes necessarily! i mean, i dunno what it is, maybe it's the amish thing.
monica| um, i'm not actually amish.
fake monica| really? then why are you like that? 
teacher| you by the door. in or out?
monica| in. 
teacher| you in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
monica| yeah, but at least i'm doing it! 
pa| this is the final boarding call for flight 67 to san diego, boarding at gate 42a.
phoebe| okay. good-bye, little monkey guy. alright, i wrote you this poem. okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
ross| aww. thank you, aunt phoebe.
phoebe| oh!
chandler| okay, bye, champ. now, i know there's gonna be a lot of babes in san diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
joey| i dunno what to say, ross. uh, it's a monkey.
ross| just, just say what you feel.
joey| marcel, i'm hungry.
ross| that was good.
rachel|  marcel, this is for you. it's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
ross| uh, if you guys don't mind, i'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
all| oh, sure. sure, absolutely. (they just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)
ross| marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (he sits down and marcel jumps down and sits beside him) well buddy, this is it. there's just a coupla things i want to say. i'm really gonna miss you, and i'm never gonna forget about you. you've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  okay, marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! marcel, would- okay, just take him away. just take him.  closing credits
