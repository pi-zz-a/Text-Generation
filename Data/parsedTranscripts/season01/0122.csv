chandler: hello rachel.
rachel: get off.
phoebe:  uh, uh, gimme. can you see me operating a drill press?
joey: i don't know. what are you wearing? 
ross: pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
phoebe: just for some short-term-work. you know, until i get back some of my massage clients.
chandler: pirates again?
phoebe:" no, nothing like that. i was just...such a dummie. i taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" and they are."
joey: hey, hey, chan. she could work for you.
chandler:  thanks joey, that's a good idea.
phoebe: what... i could, i could do it. what is it?
chandler: well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused.  it's a whole big boob story.
phoebe: i could be a secretary.
chandler: well, you know phoebs. i don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day.
phoebe: i could do that. 
rachel: what are you playing with?
ross: oh, it's my new beeper.
joey: what the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
monica: is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
ross: no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo.
chandler: a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
monica: all right, i'll see you guys later. 
rachel: off to see young ethan?
monica: thank you.
joey: how young is young ethan? young?
monica: he's... our age.
chandler: when we were?
monica: okay, he's a senior in college.
ross: college?
chandler: whoa! and this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
monica: no, of course not. it's not even an issue. cause i told him i was 22.

monica: oh, i can't pass for 22?
phoebe: well, maybe 25-26.
monica: i am 26.

rachel: just a touch. mon, i don't understand. i mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? i mean, why all the sudden are you so... oh.
monica: what?
rachel: could tonight be the night?
monica: i don't know. look he's a great guy and i love being with him but... you know. things happen, and they happen. you don't plan these things.
rachel: so, did you shave your legs?
monica: yeah.
rachel: a-ha! 
joey: would you let it go ross. it was just a dream. it doesn't mean... 
ross: oh, oh. oh, oh. oh this is it. oh my god it's baby time. baby time.

ross:  no, andré is not here.  yes, i'm sure... no, sir. i don't perform those kind of services.
joey: services?  oh, services.
ross:  yeah, you want 55-jumbo. yeah, that's right. that's right, jumbo with a u, sir.  no, belive me, you don't want me. judging by his number, i'd be a huge disappointment.  all rightie, bye bye. 
joey: hey, hey. how was the first day?
phoebe: oh, exellent. everyone was so, so nice.
chandler: see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (joey and ross wonder what he means) me.
phoebe: no, i didn't tell anybody that i knew you.
chandler: why not?
phoebe: oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
chandler: what?!
phoebe: i thought you knew that.
chandler: noho. who doesn't they like me?
phoebe: everyone. except for uh... no everyone.
chandler: what are you talking about?
phoebe:" don't feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""mr. boss man"". you know, mr. bing. mr. bing, ""boss man bing"". "
chandler: i can't belive it.
phoebe: yeah, yeah. they even do you.
chandler: they do me?
phoebe: you know like... uh okay... uh... 'could that report be any later?' 
chandler: i don't sound like that.
ross: oh, oh chandler...
joey: oh... yeah, you do.
ross: 'the hills were alive with the sound of music.' 
joey:  my scones.
phoebe, joey, and ross: 'my scones.' 
chandler: okay, i don't sound like that. that is so not true. 
chandler: that is so not... that is so not... that... oh, shut up!  
monica: did not.
young ethan: i am telling you, up until i was, like nine, i thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
monica: how was that possible?
young ethan: well, think about it. it's always on the news. 'a man is being held
up, at gunpoint.' 'tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' and i just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?  oh, ah. i should go.
monica: okay. 
young ethan: okay.
monica: unless...
young ethan: what?
monica: uh, ah. unless you wanna stay over? i mean, i'm going to, so...
young ethan: yeah, i'd really like that. 
young ethan: uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
monica: okay, is this like 'i have an early class tomorrow' or 'i'm secretly married to a goat?'
young ethan: well it's somewhere in between. you see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, i'm not uh..., well i, i mean i haven't ever uh...
monica: ethan?
young ethan: yeah?
monica: are you a virgin?
young ethan: well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes i am. i uh, i've kinda been waiting for the right person.
monica: really?
young ethan: yeah. you do know i was talking about you, right?  
young ethan: wow!
monica: you keep saying that.
young ethan: you know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. 
monica: listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. and i, i-i figured if you could be honest, then i can to.
young ethan: oh god, don't tell me, i did it wrong.
monica: no-no. nothing wrong about that. 
young ethan: oh.
monica: um, okay, here it goes. i'm not 22. i'm, i'm 25... and thirteen months. 
young ethan: huh!
monica: but i figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. i mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. 
young ethan: uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, i have another one for you. i'm a little younger than i said.
monica: you're not a senior?
young ethan: oh, i'm a senior... in high school.
monica: ok...ay. commercial break 
monica: what we did was wrong. oh god, i just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the bicentennial.
young ethan: i just had sex.
monica: ethan, focus. how could you not tell me?
young ethan: well, you never told me how old you were.
monica: well, that's different. my lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. what were you thinking?
young ethan: i wasn't thinking. i was too busy fallin'...
monica: don't say it. 
young ethan: ...in love with you.
monica: really?
young ethan:  sorry.
monica: well,fall out of it. you know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. oh god, oh god. i'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named chad. i'm joan collins.
young ethan: who?  
ross:  okay, andré should be there in like 45 minutes. all rightie, bye bye.  just easier that way.
chandler: oh, come on. you told me about the last dream.
rachel: no, forget it.
chandler: oh, why not. was i doing anything particularly... saucy?
rachel: all right, fine. um, you were not the only one there. (camera fades to ross, who's listening very carefully) joey was there too.
joey: all right. 
ross: was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
rachel: no.
ross: you're sure? nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
rachel: no, it was just the three of us.
ross: huh!
joey: so, tell me. was it like you and chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and chandler?
rachel:  you know what?
joey: what?
rachel: there were times when it wasn't even me. 
phoebe: that is so sweet, you guys.  
ross, rachel, and phoebe: hey, mon.
rachel: mon, ethan called again. mon?
all:  mon! 
monica: what?
rachel: ethan called again.
monica: oh.
ross: are you not seeing him anymore?
monica: no. you know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
chandler: and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym. 
rachel: i, i didn't say any... i sw... i did not say anything, i swear. he stopped by.
joey: listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest power ranger is? 
ross: oh, yeah.
monica: ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. could we drop it now?
joey, chander, and ross: sorry.
ross: it's morphin time!

rachel: where are you going?
phoebe: um, oh, i've got a birthday party, with some work people.
chandler: work people? nobody told me.
phoebe: no, i know. that's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
chandler: you know, i don't get this. a month ago, these people were my friends. you know, just because i'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person.
phoebe: well, then you should come tonight. you know, just hang out with them. let them see what a great guy you still are.
chandler: you think i should?
phoebe: i really do, yeah.
chandler: okay.
phoebe: okay.
chandler: okay.
phoebe: oh, but, could we not go together? i,i don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss. 
chandler: i think last night was great. you know, the karaoke thing. tracy and i doing ebony and ivory.
phoebe: you were great. but they still made fun of you.
chandler: what?
phoebe:" you know, now you're more like, you know like, ""mr. caring boss,"" ""mr."", you know, ""i'm one of you, boss,"" ""mr., i wanna be your buddy, boss man bing!"""
chandler: then, i don't get it.
phoebe: well, you know what chandler? i think you've gotta face it. you're like, the guy in the big office, you know. you're the one that hires them, that fires them... they still say you're a great boss.
chandler: they do?
phoebe: uh huh. but they're not your friends anymore.
chandler: i just wan't to...
phoebe: no, but you can't.
chandler: but i just wa...
phoebe: uh uh.

ross: oh, carol and i have a new system. if she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise i just ignore it.
joey: what about andré?
ross: oh, well this morning he got a call from who i think was our cousin nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than i needed to know. 
young ethan: hey.
monica: that was gonna be my opener.
rachel:  hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
ross: i thought that was just a rumour.
rachel: true story.
joey: they're here already? 
young ethan: all right, look. i've gotta tell you something. i'm not 17. i only said so that you'd think i was cute and vunerable. i'm actually 30, i have a wife, i have a job, i'm your congressman. monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. we can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but i thought that was great.
monica: it was.
young ethan: then, what's the problem?
monica: ethan, it's um... it's icky.
young ethan: icky? you're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
monica: this isn't easy for me either. i wish things were different, i... if you were a few years older, or if i was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, i would really...
young ethan: no, don't say it. 
monica: ...love you. (ross, rachel and joey come back from the bathroom. they discover that monica and ethan aren't finished talking to each other yet.)
ross: are you're hands still wet?
joey: uh, moist, yeah.
