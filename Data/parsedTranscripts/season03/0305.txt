CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 well relax, he’ll be here.

PHOEBE:
 no, i know, i’m just nervous. y'know it’s just y'know mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. it’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. you’re so sweet to wait with me.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 ah, kim basinger, cindy crawford, halle berry, yasmine bleeth, and ah, jessica rabbit.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 hey, monica, who would yours be?

MONICA:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 you know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 oh monica, listen, i ah, i saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. if you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.

MONICA:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 i highly doubt that. 

JOEY:
 oh yeah. if you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.  yeah.

MONICA:
 i can’t live like this! what are we gonna do? what are we gonna do?

JOEY:
 relax. here hold this . this old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)

MONICA:
 that’s a little more than i wanted to see.

JOEY:
  aw! look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. it’d take forever to pry this up. you should ah, you should just leave it. 

MONICA:
 i can’t leave it! you gouged a hole in my dingy floor. (joey places the toliet brush and holder over the hole, which is in the middle of the floor.)

JOEY:
 eh! there you go.

MONICA:
 you know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon! 

PHOEBE:
  oh, ew!

FRANK:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 yeah i know what i wanted to ask you. um, can you roll your tongue? because i can, and my mom couldn’t, and i thought y'know, i figured that was something i got from our dad.

FRANK:

PHOEBE:

FRANK:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 and!! isabella rosselini.

CHANDLER:
 ooh-hoo. very hot, very sexy. but ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.

RACHEL:
 so?

CHANDLER:
 so, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.

RACHEL:
 yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get isabella rosselini, geography. 

PHOEBE:
 okay so, by melting, you meant melting.

FRANK:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 so how’s it going with you guys?

PHOEBE:
 so far, it kinda blows. i don’t know, i just thought y'know that he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and ross, just like close and connected and....

MONICA:
 oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(phoebe shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) that’s where the waistband actually goes over your head. 

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.

PHOEBE:
 oh, how do you play the shadow game?

MONICA:
 oh, how do you play the shadow game?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 i just asked you.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 no, that is what the game is.

PHOEBE:
 which you just gave up really quickly.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 what’s the matter?

CHANDLER:
 oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.

JOEY:
  hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

FRANK:

PHOEBE:
 whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.

FRANK:
 oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and i can’t believe that i screwed it up so bad.

PHOEBE:
 you really thought it was perfect?

FRANK:
 well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?

FRANK:
 well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how i told you about my likes and my dislikes...

PHOEBE:
 i don’t....

FRANK:
 how-how i like to melt stuff, and how i dislike stuff that doesn’t melt.

PHOEBE:
 right, okay, um-mm.

FRANK:
 yeah, y'know i feel like i can really talk to you ‘cause y'know you’re my sister, y'know.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i guess i do, yeah.

FRANK:
 then i go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.

PHOEBE:
 well, i-i wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.

FRANK:
 you hopped a little bit. yeah, i really sorry.

PHOEBE:
 okay. all right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.

FRANK:

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh.

FRANK:
 oh come on we went, we went to time square, we found ninja stars, i almost got arm broken by a hooker...

PHOEBE:
 she wasn’t a hooker.

FRANK:
 well, when i tell my friends about her she will be.   

CHANDLER:
 okay, on three. one....two....

JOEY:
 why don’t we just go on two.

CHANDLER:
 why two?

JOEY:
 because it’s faster.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.

RACHEL:
 oh!

JOEY:
 all right, but in the future...

ROSS:
 okay!! okay!!

RACHEL:
 come on!

ROSS:
 heavy thing, not getting lighter!

CHANDLER:
 okay, one...two...

JOEY:
 so we are going on two?

ALL:
 all right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem, the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)

CHANDLER:
 oh, good job joe.

JOEY:
 wow, it’s big!

CHANDLER:
 yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! 

JOEY:
 maybe, my ruler’s wrong.

PHOEBE:
 maybe all the rulers are wrong.

JOEY:
 look it’s not that bad. so what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, y'know what i got a better idea. how-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn’t move.)

JOEY:
 yeah, listen, before i forget that side is still wet. 

RACHEL:
 okay sir, um-mm, let see if i got this right. ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) okay, great.  you freak. 

ROSS:
  thank you.

ISABELLA:
  um, coffee to go, please. (ross recognises her and goes over to the couch, mouthing ‘oh my god’

ROSS:
 isabella rosselini. 

MONICA:
 are you serious?  oh my god.

ROSS:
 damn! i can’t believe i took her off my list.

MONICA:
 why? ‘cause otherwise you’d go for it?

ROSS:
 yeah, maybe.

RACHEL:
 oh-oh, you lie.

ROSS:
 what you don’t think i’d go up to her?

RACHEL:
 ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.

ROSS:
 yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.

RACHEL:
 you know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.

ROSS:
 okay, hold my crawler.

RACHEL:
 okay.

MONICA:
 rach, are you really gonna let him do this?

RACHEL:
 honey, he’s about to go hit on isabella rosselini. i’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.

ROSS:
  hi! hi, i’m ross, you don’t know me, but i’m a big, big fan of yours. i mean, blue velvet, woo-oo hoo! um, i was wondering if i could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee?  or maybe reimburse you for that one? 

ISABELLA:
 aren’t you with that girl over there? (points at rachel, who waves back)

ROSS:
 well, yeah, kinda. um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so i’m allowed to sleep with you. no, no, no, it’s flattery.

ISABELLA:
 i’m sorry. 

ROSS:
 oh no, no, no, wait, wait, isabella. don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. i mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...

ISABELLA:
 yeah, for you. is that the list?

ROSS:
 um, yeah.

ISABELLA:
 may i see it?

ROSS:
 um, no.

ISABELLA:
 come on! 

ROSS:
 but, okay.

ISABELLA:
  i’m not on the list!

ROSS:
 um, see, but that’s not the final draft.

ISABELLA:
 it’s laminated!

ROSS:
 yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so i bumped you for wynona rider, local.

ISABELLA:
 y'know it’s ironic...

ROSS:
 what?

ISABELLA:
 ...because i have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday i bumped you for that guy over there. 

ROSS:
  we’re just gonna be friends. closing credits 

JOEY:
 y'know what?

CHANDLER:
 umm?

JOEY:
 i bet ‘ya ya i could fit in there. 

CHANDLER:
 i’ve got five bucks says you can’t.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 oh, i think i have the cash. (joey successfully enters the entertainment center, and chandler closes the door on joey.)

JOEY:
 you are dogged man! i totally fit!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) i’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) here you go.
