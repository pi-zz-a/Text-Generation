ross: i’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
janice: come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
joey: well, that’s really a different question.
janice: i’m sorry i find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
joey: well, there was that one time that monica and rachel got together.
monica and rachel: what?!!

monica: oh, then it must’ve been you. bye. 
phoebe:  that’s why i moved out.
ross: hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
phoebe: i think on some levels she already knows.
ross: phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your grandmother’s for a week now.
phoebe: okay, well maybe not on those levels.
chandler:  hey.
ross: hey.
chandler: i’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.
phoebe: why, nobody good?
chandler: well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. the spitter. oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. nice to meet you, chandler bing bing! great apartment chandler bing, bing!
ross: so how many more do you have tomorrow?
chandler: two. this photographer, who seemed really dull. and this actor guy, who i’m not sure about, because when he called and i answered the phone ‘chandler bing,’ he said ‘whoa-whoa, short message.’
monica: , foot on the floor or come over no more!
ross:  sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
monica: what?

phoebe: oh, really?
ross: yeah, y'know how i have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, susan something, and they really hit it off, and i-i-i think it’s gonna make a difference

chandler: yes, that is cool. because i have models here y'know......never.
eric: oh, yeah, during the summer, i spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. although, i should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.

ross: i don’t know, something girlie.
phoebe:  hey, you’re early.
monica: what are you doing with the lamp?
phoebe: i’m just taking it to be re-wired.
monica: oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week. 
phoebe: no, no, mr. heckles no one is making any noise up here.
mr. heckles: you’re disturbing my oboe practice.
phoebe: you don’t play the oboe!
mr. heckles: i could play the oboe!
phoebe: then i’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.) 
mr. heckles:  who are you?
eric: hi, i’m eric, i’m gonna be chandler’s new roommate.
mr. heckles: i’m chandler’s new roommate.
eric: i-i-i don’t think so.
mr. heckles: i could be chandler’s new roommate.
eric: but, he told me over the phone.
mr. heckles: he told me in person.
eric: that’s weird.
mr. heckles: well, i’m going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to the door and opens it) ehh!  (inside chandler’s apartment, chandler is coming in from his bedroom, sees mr. heckles, and screams.) 
monica: hi, again.
joey: hey! 
chandler:  hey!
monica: thank you soo, much.
chandler: oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. okay, i gotta get to get to work. 
monica: you want some help with that?
joey: oh, no thanks, i got it.  no i don’t!
monica: whoa! are you okay?
joey: whew! stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
monica: it’s the heat.  and-and the humidity.
joey: that’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.
monica: do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
joey: like you wouldn’t believe.  wow! this is a great place.
monica: thank you. just make yourself comfortable.
joey: gotcha.
monica: this place is really my grandmother’s. (joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) i got it from her when she moved to florida, otherwise i could never afford a place like this. so if the landlord ever asks, i’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her vcr. so are you thirsty?
joey: oh, you bet i am!
monica:  okay, here’s your penis! commercial break 
monica: oh my god!!! what are you doing?!!
joey: you said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
monica: so?!
joey: whoa, ah!! we’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?
monica: yeah huh!! cover yourself up!
joey: oh right, right.
monica: i don’t believe this! when someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
joey: well usually...yeah! well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. well, sorry, i just, i thought you liked me. i’m such a jerk.
monica: it’s okay. i suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone i know, but... by the way i can still see it. 
monica: pheebs?
phoebe: huh?
monica: where’s your bed?
phoebe: it’s not in the apartment? (monica gives a ‘come on’ look) oh no. i can’t believe this is happening again.
monica: what?
phoebe: okay, enough with the third degree! i-i’ve, i don’t live here anymore.
monica: what are you talking about?
phoebe: i’m sorry, i-i-i-i don’t live here anymore. i-i didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
monica: everybody knows!
phoebe: that was supposed to be a good thing, i forget why. just listen, monica, i, do you know, okay, do you know, i couldn’t sleep for like a month because i got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. 
monica: well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
phoebe: yeah, i would’ve except i had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
monica: what?!?!
phoebe: okay, this is what i’m talking about, this. i-i need to live in a land where people can spill.
monica: you can spill. in the sink.
phoebe: aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and i love you, and i want us to be friends, and if i keep living here i don’t see that happening.
monica: i love you, too. 
phoebe: aww, good.  what?
monica: what? i’m just said.
phoebe: no you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.  
chandler: so ah, whatcha watching?
joey: baywatch.
chandler: what’s it about?
joey: lifeguards.
chandler: well, it sounds kinda stupid...  who’s she?
joey: nicole eggert. you'll like her. 
chandler: wow! look at them run.
joey: they do that a lot. hey, you want a beer?
chandler: yeah, i’ll go get one.
joey: no, no, no, don’t get up, i got a cooler right here.  
chandler: well, hello!
monica: hey.
chandler: do you have any beers? we’re out of beers.
monica:  help yourself.
chandler: you okay?
monica: phoebe moved out.
chandler: right.
monica: i don’t understand, i mean am i so hard to live, is this why i don’t have a boyfriend?
chandler: noo!! you don’t have a boyfriend because....i don’t, i don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. you should have a boyfriend.
monica: well, i think so.
chandler: oh-ho, come here.  listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman i’ve ever known in real life.  
ross:  hi. where is everybody?
phoebe: oh, it’s already closed, chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
ross: my marriage, i think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
phoebe: oh no! why?
ross: ‘cause carol’s a lesbian.  and, and i’m not one. and apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
phoebe: oh my god! i don’t believe it! oh, you poor bunny.
ross: (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) i’m an idiot. i mean shoulda seen it, i mean carol and i’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be ross y'know look at her, and i’d think, god, my wife is cool!
phoebe: aw! hey, do you think that susan person is her lover?
ross: well, now i do!!
phoebe: i’m sorry.
ross: seven years. i mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman i’ve-i’ve ever....
phoebe: aw, god ross. oh. 
chandler: umm, this is nice.
monica: i know, it is isn’t it?
chandler: no, i mean it, this feels really good. is it a hundred percent cotton?
monica: yeah! and i got it on sale, too.
chandler: anyway, i should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
monica: well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
chandler: oh yeah, that sounds great.  oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be....
monica: i know. thanks.  
ross: maybe this would’ve happened if i’d been more nurturing, or i’d paid more attention, or i... had a uterus. i can’t believe this!
phoebe: i know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t ross. you’re, you’re really, you’re so good. 
ross: thanks.
phoebe: and you’re so sweet.  and you’re kind 
ross: thanks.  (they pause, and they the start kissing passionately, and taking off each others clothes, and they start to lie down on the pool table.)
ross: wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
phoebe: huh? (ross tries to clear off the pool table by knocking the balls to the other end of the table, but they all bounce back, and he frantically starts to throw them into the pockets.)
phoebe: okay, it’s okay. (phoebe jumps on to the table and lays down, ross follows her and hits his head on the light hanging over the pool table.)
phoebe: oh. 
ross: wait, wait, wait.
phoebe: what?
ross: my foot is stuck in the pocket.
phoebe: what?
ross: no, i can’t get it out.
phoebe: well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.
ross: no, come on don’t start.  ouch!
phoebe: what?
ross: stupid balls are in the way.  , and sit up. ross hits his head on the lamp again.)
ross: oh well. it probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
phoebe: you have chalk on your face.
ross: huh? 
phoebe: oh, ross you’re right, i don’t know why i always thought this was real grass.
monica: hey, are you okay?
ross: my wife’s a lesbian.
joey: cool!!
chandler: ross-joey, joey-ross. 
ross: hi. closing credits 
chandler: i can’t believe you came back.
rachel: don’t say anything. i don’t wanna speak, i don’t wanna think. i just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now. (she hits the jukebox fonzy style, and it’s that time of season starts to play, as they start to kiss.)
friend no. 2: rachel! rachel! (stirs rachel from her dream, she’s in her car driving back from the city)
rachel: what?
friend no. 2: you missed the exit!
rachel: oh, sorry.
friend no. 1: my god, what were you thinking about?
rachel: um,  barry.
