ROSS:

RACHEL:
 i love how he cares so much about stuff. if i squint i can pretend he’s alan alda.

MONICA:
 oh good, another dinosaur story. when are those gonna become extinct?

CHANDLER:
 if i was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.

GUNTHER:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JANICE:
 oh, i cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.

MONICA:

ROSS:

JOEY:
  i know! 

PHOEBE:
 ugh! i don’t know monica. it feels funny just being here. i mean if you buy a bed from janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying chandler.

MONICA:
 not at these prices.

PHOEBE:
  hi. y'know in england this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) woo!

MONICA:
  oh! ohhhhh! oh! phoebe, come here. aw, this is my new bed. you gotta feel this bad boy.

PHOEBE:
 eh, monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, chandler’s your friend...  oh! oh my god! aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.  he’s done which causes him to write his name with a downward curve, and he then 

JOEY:
 good evening. i’m mr. tribbiani. and i will be teaching acting for soap operas. now um, on my first day as  dr. drake remoray on days of our lives,  i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. and it goes like this.  thanks, thanks, a lot. oh, by the way, before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. all right, moving right along.  

JOEY:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 hey! ooh! how was teaching last night?

JOEY:
 oh it was great. yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, i dismiss you.’

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 oh, yay!

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 hi daddy!

DR. GREEN:
 this where they put it? what, there no table available in the kitchen! hello, baby.

RACHEL:
 you remember ross.

DR. GREEN:
 um-hmm.

ROSS:
 nice to see you again dr. green. 

DR. GREEN:
 so! (they both try to sit next to rachel but dr. green is successful.)  how’s the library?

ROSS:
 ugh, museum.

DR. GREEN:
 what happened to the library?

ROSS:
 there never was a library. i mean there are libraries, its just that i ah, i never worked at one.

DR. GREEN:
 you know what’s really good here, the lobster. what do you say shall i just order three.

ROSS:
 yeah, if you’re really hungry.  it was a joke, i made a joke.

RACHEL:
 yeah, actually daddy ross is allergic to lobster.

DR. GREEN:
 what kind of person is allergic to lobster? i guess the kind of person that works at a library.

ROSS:
 it’s not a library...

DR. GREEN:
  i know!! it’s a museum! what, you’re the only one around here who can make a joke! at least mine was funny. ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.  

ROSS:
 so, dr. green, how’s the old boat.

DR. GREEN:
 they found rust. you know what rust does to a boat?

ROSS:
 it gives it a nice antiquey look.

DR. GREEN:
  rust, is boat cancer, ross.

ROSS:
 wow. i’m sorry, when i was a kid i lost a bike to that. (rachel giggles at that)

DR. GREEN:
 excuse me for a moment, will you please, i want to say good night to the levines, before we go.

RACHEL:
 okay.

ROSS:
 okay! 

RACHEL:
 aw honey stop! it’s not that bad.

ROSS:
 yeah.  op! uh-oh! i think your dad must’ve added wrong. he only tipped like four percent.

RACHEL:
 yeah. that’s daddy.

ROSS:
 that’s daddy?! but doesn’t it bother you? you’re a waitress.

RACHEL:
 yes, it bothers me ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, i’d be serving him sneezers.

ROSS:
 so?

RACHEL:
 so. ross, i’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.

ROSS:
 you really serve people sneezers?

RACHEL:
 well um, i don’t.

DR GREEN:
 you kids ready?

ROSS:
 thanks again, dr. green.

DR. GREEN:
 all right. (ross takes a twenty and slips it underneath the bill when dr. green isn’t looking.)

DR. GREEN:
 oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, i think i forgot my receipt.

ROSS:
 oh, ah, you don’t need that.

DR. GREEN:
 why not?

ROSS:
 the carbon, it’s messy, i mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.

DR. GREEN:
  what is this? who put a twenty down here? huh?

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, that would be me, um, i have, i have a problem i-i tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.

RACHEL:
 yeah it is, it is.  we really, really have to do something about that.

ROSS:
 i know.

DR. GREEN:
 excuse me, you think i’m cheap?

RACHEL:
 oh daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.

ROSS:
 nothing i do means anything, really.

DR. GREEN:
 this is nice. i pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like mr. big shot. you really want to be mr. big shot? here, i’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, mr. big shot, all right. (rips up the bill, and throws it at ross, then leaves)

ROSS:
 well mr. big shot is better than ‘wethead’. 

JOEY:
 okay, some tricks of the trade. now, i’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if i’m in a scene where i have to cry, i cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. or ah, or, let’s say i wanna convey that i’ve just done something evil. that would be the basic ‘i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it’ (does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) okay, let’s say i’ve just gotten bad news, well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  and that’s how it’s done. great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.

STUDENT:
 hey, mr. trib.

JOEY:
 hey-hey.

STUDENT:
 guess what, i got an audition!

JOEY:
 awww, one of my students got an audition. i’m so proud.

STUDENT:
 i was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?

JOEY:
 you bet! what’s the part?

STUDENT:
 oh it’s great, it’s a role on all my children, nick the boxer.  commercial break 

RACHEL:
 you had to do it, didn’t you? you couldn’t just leave it alone.

ROSS:
 four percent. okay. i tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.

RACHEL:
 ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (ross groans and rubs his neck) oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.

ROSS:
 yeah, i’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. 

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 i’m, i’m freaking out! monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! all right, i haven’t lived here in a while, so i have to ask you something. does monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?

RACHEL:
 um. yeah.

PHOEBE:
 i am soo dead. 

RACHEL:
 all right, look, here’s the bottom line ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. so, i’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.

ROSS:
 look, honey, i have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.

RACHEL:
 okay, look, ross, i realise that my father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.

ROSS:
 look sweetie, i could be the bigger man, i could be the biggest man, i could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that i could pick your father up and say ‘like me! like me tiny doctor!’

RACHEL:
 okay, well can’t you just try it one more time ross? for me? for me?

ROSS:
 rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. you gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.

RACHEL:
 okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. because i already got a mother and a father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, i don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! 

ROSS:
 okay, okay, okay.  i’ll get the bagels. 

MONICA:
  what’s this?

PHOEBE:
 isn’t it cool! varoom! varoom!

MONICA:
 this is not the bed i ordered!

PHOEBE:
 i know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!  

MONICA:
 phoebe! 

MONICA:
 why is this car in my bedroom?

PHOEBE:
 i’m sorry, okay, i-i wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...

MONICA:
 when did i sign for it?

PHOEBE:
 when i was you! y'know what, it’s all joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!

MONICA:
 did you make brownies today?

CHANDLER:
 knock, knock.

MONICA:
  quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.

CHANDLER:
 hey, i’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.

PHOEBE:
 it’s monica’s bed. what?

CHANDLER:
 okay.  it’s a racecar.

PHOEBE:
 so. this has always been monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?

CHANDLER:
 okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?

MONICA:
 sometimes i have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.) 

STUDENT:
 look, i just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.

JOEY:
 wow! that was good. that was... tweezers?

STUDENT:
 no.

JOEY:
 whoa. that was really good.

STUDENT:
 thanks, any suggestions?  

CHANDLER:
 you told him to play the boxer gay!!

JOEY:
 well, i-i might’ve said supergay.

CHANDLER:
 you totally screwed him over.

MONICA:
 joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. i mean how could you do this?

JOEY:
 because, monica, the guy’s so good, and i really, really want this part.

PHOEBE:
 well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay. 

RACHEL:
  hi daddy.

DR. GREEN:

ROSS:

DR. GREEN:

ROSS:

DR. GREEN:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

DR. GREEN:

RACHEL:

DR. GREEN:

ROSS:

DR. GREEN:

RACHEL:

DR. GREEN:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 what? it’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.

DR. GREEN:
 come on! you’re just titling!  her legs are fine!

ROSS:
 i know that!

DR. GREEN:
 so, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?

RACHEL:
 i’m sorry, let her?

ROSS:
 what can i do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.

DR. GREEN:
 wait a minute, you don’t have renter’s insurance?!

RACHEL:
 no.

DR. GREEN:
 well what if somebody steals something? how are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?! 

ROSS:
 hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?

DR. GREEN:
 i’d love some juice. thanks.

ROSS:
 okay.  wow! this is going so well. did you see us? did you see?

RACHEL:
 yeah honey, i’m standing right there! why didn’t you just tell him about the mole i haven’t got checked yet.

ROSS:
 excellent! 

JOEY:
  there will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. i had such an opportunity in the recent, present. and i’m ashamed to say that i took it, i advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. and now, he’s got a two year contract opposite susan luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me i’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv. i’m sorry, i’m sorry, i’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) thank you. 

JESTER:
 uh, may i help you?

MONICA:
 yeah, i talked to you on the phone, i’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.

JESTER:
 look, it’s like i told you, there’s nothing i can do. you signed for it, monica velula geller.

JOEY:
 all right, jester man, look we wanna see the king.

JESTER:
 nobody sees the king!

JOEY:
 oh-ho-kay, i’m talking to the king. 

JESTER:
 hey! you can’t go back there! (joey goes to the door, but stops and looks through the window at janice and the mattress king, her ex-husband, kissing.)

JANICE:
 oh my god.  closing credits
