JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
  hey.

CHANDLER AND JOEY:
 hey.

ROSS:
 listen, i-i need a favor. umm, i was in the shower, and as i was cleansing myself, i ah, i-i, well i felt something.

CHANDLER:
 was it like a sneeze only better?

ROSS:
 no, no, i mean, i mean a thing on my body.

JOEY:
  what was it?

ROSS:
 well, i don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... it's not visually accessible to me, and i was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. 

CHANDLER AND JOEY:
 whoa!!!

CHANDLER:
 no!!

ROSS:
 come on you guys, it's no big deal! (he turns around and shows him his thing.)

CHANDLER:
 whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  huh.

ROSS:
 well what is it? is it a mole? (he moves closer to them, and they jump back.)

JOEY:
 no, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

ROSS:
 well, eww. what? is it a pimple?

CHANDLER:
 no, it's... fancier than a pimple. look ross, why don't you just go see a… 

RACHEL:
  hey guys! what's... (sees what they're doing and stops, the guys are stunned)

CHANDLER:
 okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.

ROSS:
 ahhh.

JOEY:
 yeah, right.  opening credits  

PHOEBE:
  okay, and then this is the coffee house. this is where i play my music. 

VINCE:
 good deal.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and these are my friends. people. this is vince, vince the people.

RACHEL:
 hi!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

VINCE:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 vince is a fireman.

RACHEL:
 wow! have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?

VINCE:
 98 hot saves, highest in the force.

CHANDLER:
 well, y'know if joey and i played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred. 

VINCE:
  fire safety is not a joke, son.

CHANDLER:
 you're right, i know.

VINCE:
  see you saturday. 

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

RACHEL:
 wow, he's cute, pheebs! but i thought you just started dating that kindergarten teacher.

PHOEBE:
 oh, jason? yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.

RACHEL:
 what-pheebs?! two dates in one day? that's so unlike you.

PHOEBE:
 i know, i know! i'm like playing the field. y'know? like, juggling two guys, i'm sowing my wild oats. y'know? y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.

JOEY:
 so pheebs, do they know about each other?

PHOEBE:
 does a dog's lips move when he reads? (joey makes an `i don't know' face, and looks to chandler and rachel, who're also stumped) okay, no they don't.

ROSS:
  hey guys!

JOEY:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hi! 

JOEY:
  well?!

CHANDLER:
  okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?

ROSS:
 well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.

JOEY:
 well what is it?!

ROSS:
 he couldn't even tell me! he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what? you should go to my guy, because when i went in there with my third nipple. he just lopped it right off. y'know? so i guess i'm lucky. i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.

ROSS:
 at least they knew what yours was. y'know, yours had a name.

JOEY:
 oh! maybe they'll name yours after you! y'know, they'll call it, the ross. and then people would be like, "awww, he's got a ross."

ROSS:
  yeah, that'd be cool! 

MONICA:
 pete's breaking up with me.

ALL:
 what?!

MONICA:
 i just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from atlanta, we need to talk.

RACHEL:
 and?

MONICA:
 well that's it. people never say `we need to talk' unless it's something bad.

JOEY:
 whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.

MONICA:
 really?!

JOEY:
 yeah, maybe he just cheated on you. 

JASON:
 ...and i know i'll never miss doing it, but i gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.

PHOEBE:
 that is so great! oh, i... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) oh my god!

JASON:
 whoa!

PHOEBE:
  oh my god!!!

JASON:
 ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!

PHOEBE:
  no! no! 

JASON:
 no, no?

PHOEBE:
 well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.  oh my god, here they come! well, we gotta get out of here!

JASON:
 w-w-w-wait! why?!

PHOEBE:
 well look, if i wanted to see a fireman, i would date one. okay? (she drags him away) 

ROSS:
 th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. y'know? just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. y'know? you can take it off. just slice that baby right off!

DR. RHODES:
 take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  what are you doing?

ROSS:
 just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.

DR. RHODES:
 well that's not a third nipple.

ROSS:
 no?

DR. RHODES:
 first of all, it's on your ass.

ROSS:
 well then, what is it?!

DR. RHODES:

DR. JOHNSON:

DR. RHODES:
 he's good with rear things, bring him in too. 

MONICA:
  y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe i won't water his plants.

CHANDLER:
 well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe joey and i should water his plants. if y'know what i mean.

JOEY:
 or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.

PHOEBE:
  …and i-i can't take it! y'know? i'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. it's making me crazy.

RACHEL:
 well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?

PHOEBE:
  uh.

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa-whoa. what ah, what happened to playing the field?

PHOEBE:
 well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. it's like i'm working in the field.

RACHEL:
 so pheebs, pick one of them.

MONICA:
 yeah. which one do you like more?

PHOEBE:
 well, vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. y'know? he's so burly, he's sooo very burly. 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 yes, but this is pete. okay? he’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to rome. for most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.

MONICA:
 well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.

ROSS:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i like vince a lot, y'know? but, it’s just jason’s so sensitive, y'know? and in the long run, i think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt. (her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.)  jason! definitely jason! okay, wish me luck!

ALL:
 good luck! 

RACHEL:
 oh my god!!! (she holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) sorry, i was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.

FIREMAN:

VINCE:

VINCE:
 uh-huh. g-good deal.

PHOEBE:
 i’m sorry.

VINCE:
 no-no it’s okay. it’s just that ah, i thought we had something pretty special here. and y'know i-i felt like you were someone i could finally open up to, and…  that there’s so much in me i have to share with you yet.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, i didn’t…

VINCE:
  i’m sorry, i can’t talk. i’m gonna go write in my journal. 

PHOEBE:
  wait-wait-wait! wait!! 

PHOEBE:
  i’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.

ROSS:
 thank you, but i want to remove it pheebs. i don’t want to make it savory.

MONICA:
 y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.

ROSS:
 gimme this. 

RACHEL:
  hi! okay, don’t be mad at me, but i couldn’t resist.

MONICA:
 brides magazines?

RACHEL:
 yes, and i know that you’d say no if he asked you, but i’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this donna carin. (shows her the picture.)

PHOEBE:
  oh, you so would! oh, you should get that anyway. (they both look at her.) like for clubbing. 

MONICA:
 it is so weird, i know what i said, but uh, this morning, i was lying in bed i was, i was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) i know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean i can’t. right? i mean i’m-i’m crazy about pete, and i know that we want the same things, and when i thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.

RACHEL:
 oh my god.  

MONICA:
 i know. 

PHOEBE:
 hey mon umm, if you do get married, can i bring two guests?

RACHEL:
 you didn’t break up with that fireman?

PHOEBE:
 no, that was my way of telling you. well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.

RACHEL:
 wow!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

MONICA:
 so then, are you going to dump jason?

PHOEBE:
 well, yeah, because i have to break up with someone, and… okay so jason is sensitive,  but now so’s vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) plus, vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the vince side) so… it’s really just about the math. 

PHOEBE:
  jason?

JASON:
 yeah, come on in. (she goes in, and sees jason without his shirt. it turns out that he has a great body too, and is at a loss for words.)

JASON:
 so phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?

PHOEBE:

GURU SAJ:

MONICA:

MONICA:

PETE:
 it’s time for me to conquer the physical world.

MONICA:
 okay. 

PETE:

MONICA:

PETE:
 i want to become the ultimate fighting champion! it’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states!

MONICA:
 what are you talking about?

PETE:
 okay, my trainer, ho chi, is teaching me a combination of gee koon doe and brazilian street fighting, i’ve even had my own octagon training ring designed.

MONICA:
 and i suppose you used a ring designer for that.

PETE:
 yeah. monica, i want you there in the front row when i win. i want you close enough to smell the blood. what do you think?

MONICA:
 my parents will be so happy. 

PHOEBE:
  “crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (jason enters) crazy underwear, always in a rut. crazy under--wear…” (in her head) oh no! what is he doing here? all right, just keep playing, just keep playing. you’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (she tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.)  okay, thank you. and, as always no one talk to me after the show. 

JASON:

VINCE:

JASON:

PHOEBE:

VINCE:

PHOEBE:

JASON:

PHOEBE:
  well, that could’ve been really awkward.

VINCE:
 you made him a candle light dinner in the park?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but i-i-i-i can do that for you, i’m gonna do that for you.

VINCE:
 uh yeah, i can’t believe i ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.  closing credits 

CHANDLER:

GURU SAJ:
