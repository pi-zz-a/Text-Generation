CHANDLER:
  so ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!

BONNIE:
 all right, i was 15, it was my best friend, ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, i don’t know, we were, we were making out.

CHANDLER:
 tell it again.  seriously. 

RACHEL:
  i mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?

JOEY:
 yeah, sure. well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.

MONICA:
 joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.

JOEY:
 well, i think we all learned something.

PHOEBE:
  hey, you guys! look what i found! look at this!  that’s my mom’s writing! look.

CHANDLER:
  me and frank and phoebe, graduation 1965.

PHOEBE:
 y'know what that means?

JOEY:
 that you’re actually 50?

PHOEBE:
 no-no, that’s not, that’s not me phoebe, that’s her pal phoebe. according to her high school yearbook, they were like b.f.f. (ross and bonnie look at her quizzically) best friends forever.

ALL:
 oh!

RACHEL:
 that is so cool.

PHOEBE:
 i know! so this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my dad is. so i looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. so maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?

ALL:
 yeah! yeah, we can!

BONNIE:
  shoot! i can’t go, i have to work!

ROSS:
 that’s too bad.

RACHEL:
  ohh, big, fat bummerrr.

PHOEBE:
 so great! okay! tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to montauk.

JOEY:
 hey, bonnie had sex there!  opening credits  

MONICA:
  would you look at them. am i ever gonna find a boyfriend again? i gonna die an old maid.

CHANDLER:
 you’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.

MONICA:
  thanks!

CHANDLER:
 hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, i’ll be your boyfriend. 

MONICA:
 yeah right.

CHANDLER:
 why is that so funny?

MONICA:
 you made a joke right? so i laughed.

CHANDLER:
 ha-ha-ha. a little to hard. what am i not ah, boyfriend material?

MONICA:
 well, no. you’re chandler. y'know, chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. but theoretically y'know, i mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. i show up at your door, and i’m like  “hey, nice to meet, ya. hey, oh-hey.”

MONICA:
 well i’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.

JOEY:
  hey!

MONICA:
 oh, hey! oh good, you brought food!

JOEY:
 no, it’s just my luggage. 

CHANDLER, MONICA, AND JOEY:
 hey!!

JOEY:
 woo-hoo! all right! yeah!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i am having the best karma this week. first, i find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.

ROSS:
 yeah? what about ah, that bike messenger you hit?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i wasn’t talking about his karma.

RACHEL:
  hey! 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey-hey, check out the hat! (she is wearing this giant straw hat, the brim on it must be at least, least foot wide.)

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 seriously, where did you get the hat?

RACHEL:
 ross gave it to me.

ROSS:
 yeah, i think she looks good.

RACHEL:
 ohh, thank you.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, i am here to tell you that hats are back.

PHOEBE:
 and this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.  

ROSS:
 go, go, go!

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat! 

PHOEBE:
 oy!!

MONICA:
 what’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the floor, which is covered in sand)

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah, bob said there might be flood damage.

ROSS:
 yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.  

PHOEBE SR:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE SR:

PHOEBE:
  well, so, umm, anyway umm, i’ve been, i’ve been looking for my father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?

PHOEBE SR:

PHOEBE:
  oh, okay. well, so tell me everything about my parents. everything.

PHOEBE SR:
 ohh, well. y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE SR:
 the three losers. oh, poor lily. (phoebe notices a picture on the fridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) ohh, y'know i-i heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.

PHOEBE:
  yeah, no, it was great.  rachel is doing monica’s nails, and they’re all drinking margaritas, obviously 

JOEY:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 oh, come on!

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:

THE GUYS:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

ALL:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.

JOEY:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
  well! is everybody else having just the best time?!

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 after he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.

RACHEL:
 well i assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. did you guys hear them last night?

CHANDLER:

BONNIE:

RACHEL:

BONNIE:

RACHEL:

BONNIE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

BONNIE:

RACHEL:

BONNIE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

BONNIE:

BONNIE:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

BONNIE:

RACHEL:

BONNIE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 all right! ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?

ROSS:
 y'know, hey! you’re the one who ended it, remember?

RACHEL:
 yeah, because i was mad at you, not because i stopped loving you!

ROSS:
 you still love me?

RACHEL:
 noo.

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 i just, i feel, i-i just...

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 i feel... (ross leans in and kisses her. they both look at each other for a moment, and then embrace in a more passionate kiss, only to be interrupted by joey and chandler coming outside.)

CHANDLER:
  noo!! i don’t care! i’m not, i’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!  

JOEY:
 but i made cards!!

RACHEL:
 well! good night.  i’m going upstairs.

JOEY AND CHANDLER:
 g’night. (rachel walks inside, stops, and turns back to look at ross for a moment then goes upstairs.)

JOEY:
  wanna play strip poker for practice?  (she throws her bag inside, and starts to climb through the window. she gets halfway in and the window slams shut on her butt.)

PHOEBE:
 ow! my ass. okay. okay. (she manages to climb completely inside and the window slams shut.) oh, shhh! (she starts walking across the darkened room and hits her head on a wind chime hanging from the ceiling, to stop it from making a noise she grabs it and “shhh’s” it. she goes into the kitchen and finds phoebe sr.’s appointment book, to read it she opens the freezer. just as she starts to read, phoebe sr. jumps out from her bedroom with a coat hanger, startling phoebe.)

PHOEBE:
 no! no!! it’s me! it’s me! i-i didn’t want to make any noise!

PHOEBE SR:
 then don't break in!!

PHOEBE:
 i’m sorry.

PHOEBE SR:

PHOEBE:
 i-i, came to fill your ice cube trays.

PHOEBE SR:

PHOEBE:
 umm, okay, okay, look. i took this picture from your fridge. okay, because i know that this is my father. yeah, this is frank buffay and you are standing right there next to him. now, look i deserve to know where i came from. all right? so if you can help me find my father then you should! otherwise, you’re just mean!  so, just tell me the truth!

PHOEBE SR:

PHOEBE:
 my father is chuck magioni?

PHOEBE SR:
 no, no, that’s just chuck magioni, i-i sold him a house last year! and i’m very sorry, but i don’t know where your father is, and that’s the truth.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

PHOEBE SR:
 but umm, you’re right. i think that a person should know where they come from. wh-which is why i ah,  okay. i’m your mother.

PHOEBE:
 heh?

PHOEBE SR:
 y'know i wanted to tell you yesterday, but i just, i kinda felt all floopy, and...    

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 okay, then you gotta back away, all right? you don’t need that kind’ve hurt. take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......

ROSS:

BONNIE:

ROSS:

BONNIE:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 right, and you go with rachel, bonnie’s free tonight?  doors. he looks at the one on the right, then he looks at the one on his left, thinks 

ROSS:
  closing credits  

CHANDLER:
  hi there.

MONICA:
 that’s that weird voice again.

CHANDLER:
 okay! okay! let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date this next guy, i swear! (monica closes the door, chandler knocks, and monica opens it to reveal chandler on his knees.)
