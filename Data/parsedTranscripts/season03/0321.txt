RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 yeah! okay, here you go. 

GUNTHER:

PHOEBE:

GUNTHER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
  hey.

JOEY:
 hey. y'know with that goatee you kinda look like satan.

CHANDLER:
 oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.  okay, listen, you have to cheer up! okay? you should come out with ross and me, i mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about kate.

JOEY:
 hey i was crying because, because nobody believed quincy’s theory. okay?

ROSS:
  hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 yeah. 

JOEY:
 saw a girl with that vest.

CHANDLER:
 thanks. 

ANCHORWOMAN:
  while most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional easter gifts. some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (joey is intrigued by the idea) unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won’t live to see the fourth of july. (joey starts to call a place to buy a little baby chick) because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.

JOEY:
  yeah, hi. you guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘cause i was watching this ah, commercial on tv and man, those guys are cute! 

PETE:
 hi!

MONICA:
 hi! hey, pete you’re back! hey, check this out. (she starts to skate over to him)

PETE:
 wow! skates!  

MONICA:
 wow! you’re a lot sturdier that chandler. he crumpled like a piece of paper. so how was you’re trip?

PETE:
 well... 

MONICA:
 oh, what’d ya bring me?!  awww, hotel toiletries from japan. oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. you want some coffee?

PETE:
 yeah, sure, that’d be great. 

MONICA:
  regular or decaf?

PETE:
 ah, which ever is closest. 

MONICA:
 okay. 

PETE:
 so ask me what i did today.

MONICA:
 so what did you do today pete?

PETE:
 i bought a restaurant and i would like you to be the head chef.

MONICA:
 what?! oh. 

MONICA:
 can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?

RACHEL:
 what a jerk! you want me to kick his ass?

MONICA:
 i mean this has been like my dream since i got my first easy bake oven and opened easy monica’s bakery. i mean i would kill for this job. i mean i can totally do this job, and god knows i paid my dues.  but pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.

RACHEL:
 and you’re still not attracted to him at all?

MONICA:
 hmm, no. i mean how can i accept a restaurant from him? i-i-i-i can’t. i couldn’t even accept a necklace from stu vincent in the seventh grade.

RACHEL:
 yeah, but mon that’s totally different. he was you’re health teacher.

MONICA:
 oh, please.  

MONICA:
 what? honey.

RACHEL:
 oh, i am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.

MONICA:
 oh god, i’m so sorry.

RACHEL:
 i know.  

RACHEL:
 ow!!

MONICA:
 oh god!

ROSS:
  hey, you guys! guess what?

RACHEL:
  got a job on a river boat?

ROSS:
 y'know what i didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. well, guess what? you’re not my girlfriend anymore so...

RACHEL:
 oh i see, so this suit is making a point.

ROSS:
 right.

RACHEL:
 now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.

ROSS:
  you like it right?

MONICA:
 oh absolutely. i like it even more on you than i did on colonel sanders.  ross! ross! i’m kidding!

RACHEL:
 yeah, come here!

MONICA:
 what-what was it you were gonna tell us? 

RACHEL:
 yeah. oh! was how you invented the cotton gin?!

ROSS:
 okay, good bye!  

CHANDLER:
 so um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.

PHOEBE:
 umm, oh, about three months.

CHANDLER:
 okay, so i guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.

JOEY:
  hey!!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 i got you something! open it! open it!

CHANDLER:
 okay.  it’s a chicken.

JOEY:
 it’s cute, huh?

PHOEBE:
 whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?

CHANDLER:
 fowl? no. women? nooo.

PHOEBE:
 okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. they require constant care. they-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.

JOEY:
 oh, well no problem there. (he picks up the chick, hugs it really tight, and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)

CHANDLER:
 easy lenny. 

PETE:
 so? i mean have you thought about it?

MONICA:
 okay. here’s the thing.

PETE:
 oh no, not the thing. i hate the thing. what’s the thing?

MONICA:
 i can’t do it. i’m sorry, i wish i could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....

PETE:
 wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? if that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.

MONICA:
 huh?

PETE:
 no! look, i was gonna tell you this over dinner, but i met somebody else. on my trip.

MONICA:
 oh?

PETE:
 her name’s ann, she’s a journalist. ahh, we met on the plane. she asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, i thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. yeah, i just, i mean i got, i got tired of waiting.

MONICA:
 oh, that’s great! i mean i’m-i’m sorry, but i’m so happy for you. and now i can work for you!

PETE:
 i guess you can.

MONICA:
 oh my god! oh, this is incredible! ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him on the cheek) all right, y'know what? i’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!

PETE:
 all right.

MONICA:
 okay.  can you give me a little push?

PETE:
 yeah, sure. good luck!

MONICA:
  i’m quitting!! woo-hoo! (she rolls through a doorway and out of sight. we then hear a big crash, and see monica roll past the door the other way.) i’m okay!! i’m all right!!

PHOEBE:
  wow! that’s exciting, you went to japan, made up a woman.

PETE:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 i’m just saying, this woman, i mean she’s fictitious. no?

PETE:
 why would you say that?

PHOEBE:
 ‘cause you’re still into monica. so you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...

PETE:
 you’re good. you’re good!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, no, i’m fairly intuitive and psychic. it’s a substantial gift.

PETE:
 listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?

PHOEBE:
 absolutely, oh i promise. tell her what?

PETE:
 thanks a lot.

PHOEBE:
 no i’m serious. i mean i’m intuitive, but my memory sucks. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, but this is the last time.  with a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(joey enters)-chickeeeen.

JOEY:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 how’s she doing?

CHANDLER:
 she?

JOEY:
 well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?

CHANDLER:
 i don’t know. (he picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) i can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.

JOEY:
 well, anyway, i got to go change, i’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.

CHANDLER:
 excuse me?

JOEY:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 i stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!

JOEY:
 hey! who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?

CHANDLER:
 you don’t think i get up when you get up?

JOEY:
 ohhh, here it comes.

CHANDLER:
 yes, here it comes! i’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? well i don’t think so mister!

JOEY:
 hey!! i need to relax! okay? i was working all day!

CHANDLER:
 and you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?

JOEY:
 that’s not what i said. okay, i just meant...

CHANDLER:
 i know what you meant!!  you notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?

JOEY:
 i don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.

CHANDLER:
 i’ll take her back tomorrow.

JOEY:
 do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?

ROSS:
  hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

ROSS:
  ohhh, hey! all right, listen, i-i have that tv thing in like two hours, and i need your help, okay? what do you think?  this blue suit, or this brown one?

JOEY:
 well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.

ROSS:
 really?  

RACHEL:
  oww! (she grabs the bottle, but has trouble opening it. she pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as ross enters.)

ROSS:
 wow! that aspirin dance really works!

RACHEL:
  oww!

ROSS:
 oh my god, is that still...

RACHEL:
 i’m fine, i’m fine.

ROSS:
 no you’re not.

RACHEL:
 yes i am! 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 look, i’m fine. watch.  look at that.  whoa-whoa!

ROSS:
  okay, okay. look, you have got to go to a doctor! okay?

RACHEL:
 no. i have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. it’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there i have to meet.

ROSS:
 and i’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. hi! i’m rachel green. it’s nice to meet you. (he lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands with it, just like how rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) come on, you probably have a broken rib!

RACHEL:
 well, i will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.

ROSS:
 rach...

RACHEL:
 but y'know, i could use a hand getting ready.

ROSS:
 rachel...

RACHEL:
 look, either help me or go.

ROSS:
 fine. i’ll go.

RACHEL:
  okay, but before you go, could you help me first?

ROSS:
  sure. i’ll help you.

CHANDLER:
  oh, good! good! do you guys know how to get a chick out of a vcr?! commercial break  

RACHEL:
  y'know what? i cannot do this with my left hand! would you please, help me with this too?

ROSS:
 ohh. (he drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. he doesn’t like how it tastes.)

RACHEL:
  okay. let’s use this brush. (hands him another one.)

ROSS:
 okay. this stuff? 

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 all right.

RACHEL:
 careful. light. okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. okay? just sweep it.

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 okay, just sweep it.

ROSS:
 i’m sweeping...

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...

ROSS:
 what? what?

RACHEL:
 we don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle. 

ROSS:
 no. no, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (rachel is shocked) what?

RACHEL:
 since when, since when do you think i don’t wear enough of this?

ROSS:
 well i, close your eyes, i just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close... 

RACHEL:
 blow it.

ROSS:
  sorry. ‘cause umm, i think this will make you a little more sophisticated.

RACHEL:
 sophisticated like a hooker? 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 i know.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, i have to tell you something.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 but i can’t tell you.

MONICA:
 okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.

PHOEBE:
 well, sure in a perfect world. but, no, i promised i wouldn’t tell, and i swore to like all my gods.

MONICA:
 okay. does it have to do with ross and rachel?

PHOEBE:
 no.

MONICA:
 does it have to do with joey?

PHOEBE:
 no.

MONICA:
 does it have to do with-with chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?

PHOEBE:
 no, but let’s come back to that later! 

ROSS:
 there you go! good enough for your party, huh? (she turns and looks in the mirror, and it’s way, way over done. she looks like she has two black eyes.)

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 yep?

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
  sure, okay.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 yeah, but that was different. y’know? i mean, we were, we were going out then, now i think it’s weird.

ROSS:
 rach, y'know i can see you naked any time i want.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh, wait, wait. clogs, or claws?

MONICA:
 clogs.

PHOEBE:
 no.

MONICA:
 claws?!

PHOEBE:
 no.

MONICA:
 okay, so it doesn’t involve ross or rachel or chandler or joey. but, what about pete?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 i don’t know! 

MONICA:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 okay, does it involve something to do with pete’s computer company?

PHOEBE:
 oh, just go. you’re never gonna get it!  he’s on one leather chair, the chick is on the other. it’s watching yasmine 

CHANDLER:
 i know. see, yes. that’s yasmine bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. i love you both. but in very different ways.

JOEY:
  hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
  ohhh. (sees he still has the chick) ahh! what are you doing?! i thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.

CHANDLER:
 i did! but the store wouldn’t take her back! so then i took her to the shelter, and you know what i found out?  (joey wants to know, but chandler doesn’t want to discuss it by the chick, so he and joey move over to the windows and away from the chick.) 

CHANDLER:
 if they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! and i’m not gonna let that happen to little yasmine!

JOEY:
 okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause i was kinda having second thoughts too. 

CHANDLER:
 okay. and it’s not just chicks y'know? it’s all kinds of other animals!

JOEY:
 that’s horrible! well, you did the right thing man.

CHANDLER:
 thanks, i’m glad you see it that way. (he hear a duck start quacking, and see it waddle into the living room from the bathroom. joey wants to know what’s with the duck.)

CHANDLER:
 ohhh-hoo, funny story!  

MONICA:
 i don’t believe this! wow, look at this refrigerator! it’s gigantic! i mean i could live in this thing! i’d be cold, but i’m always cold. oh my god, look at these spider burners! i love spider burners.

PETE:
 so you like it?

MONICA:
 oh, it is sooo perfect. thank you so much. 

PETE:
 oh, you’re welcome. 

MONICA:

PETE:

MONICA:

PETE:

MONICA:

PETE:

MONICA:
 pete.

PETE:
 okay, i love you. is that so bad?

MONICA:
 no, it’s not bad. it’s not bad at all. it’s-it’s really nice.

PETE:
 look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. and i’m okay with that.

MONICA:
 you may be okay about getting hurt, but i am not okay with being the one who hurts you. that’s why i can’t take this job.

PETE:
 what?

MONICA:
 and well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. i’m sorry.

PETE:
 okay, yeah. i mean... if that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay.

MONICA:
 okay, bye.  

PETE:
 i’m sorry things didn’t work out...

MONICA:
 all right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (she kisses him back on the lips) oh, wow!   

RACHEL:
 okay, you’d tell me the truth. right?

ROSS:
 rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh my god! 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 eh, ‘cause i knew that if i told you, you’d make me go, and i knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. come on. come on.

RACHEL:

ROSS:
