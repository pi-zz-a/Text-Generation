JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something.

JOEY:
 anyway! her and ross just started yelling at each other.

PHOEBE:
 wait. why was he yelling at her? he’s the one who slept with someone else. 

JOEY:
 well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.

PHOEBE:
 whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after cub scouts.

PHOEBE:
 y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together, they never broke up. and we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....

JOEY:
 i had the same dream!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and nobody slept with that xerox girl. 

JOEY:
 oh, i had the opposite dream.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, i mean it’s been a week.

JOEY:
 yeah, i mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 we’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.

ROSS:
 yeah, that’s okay, i mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend i’m alone by myself, y'know then i totally, totally understand.

PHOEBE:
 y'know what, i can stay, i’m gonna stay. ‘cause the last time i went skiing i was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, i just went around and around.

JOEY:
 uh, pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, i’ll stay.

MONICA:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 well, then, i might as well offer to stay.  

JOEY:
  hey, does anybody else feel bad about ross?

MONICA:
 why? do you think he’s still mad at us?

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 no. thank you.

MONICA:
  no, rachel never pees in public restrooms.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 oh i do! op, no, wait a minute, i took it out of my shirt when i put it on this morning.

MONICA:

JOEY:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.

THE GIRLS:

JOEY:
 if you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.

PHOEBE:
 okay, monica’s are the biggest.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 what, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small i mean, i-i-i actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.

MONICA:
 all right then, your bra would still be big.

RACHEL:
 no, i stuff outside the bra.

CHANDLER:
 ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? phoebe, rachel take off monica’s bra.

PHOEBE:
 all right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine. 

RACHEL:
  chandler, what are you doing? there is a trash can right there.

CHANDLER:
 well, i thought if i littered, that crying indian might come by and save us.

PHOEBE:
  okay, there.

JOEY:
 thank you phoebe, that is very, very generous.

CHANDLER:
 okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.

JOEY:

CAROL:

ROSS:

CAROL:

ROSS:

CAROL:
 ah yeah, but now it’s susan and me in mexico and the hostages coming home.

ROSS:

CAROL:

ROSS:

CAROL:
 umm, yeah, actually, susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary.

ROSS:
 oh! i thought you guys got married in uh, january?

CAROL:
 it’s not that kind of anniversary.

ROSS:
 ah!  oh.

CAROL:
 sooo!! anyway...

ROSS:
 umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so rachel and i broke up.

CAROL:
 oh god, ross i am so sorry.

ROSS:
 yeah, well.

CAROL:
 y'know what, i want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

ROSS:
 oh yeah, i’d love that.

CAROL:
 oh, great! me too.

ROSS:
 i guess it all started when rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.) 

PHOEBE:
 okay, yeah.  triple a can pick us up.

RACHEL:
 great!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, what town are we near?

MONICA:
 freemont. west-westmont, ah westburg?

PHOEBE:
  then why are you answering? do you at least know what route we’re on?

RACHEL:
 yeah, we are definitely on route 27.

PHOEBE:
 okay.  there is no route 27.  okay, either 93 or 76?

RACHEL:
 i don’t know, i’m sorry, i always slept in the back when we drove up here.

PHOEBE:
 okay.  hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?  yeah, no they don’t do that.

RACHEL:
 ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.

MONICA:
 who? i mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? i think we should call ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.

RACHEL:
 no! no, i am not getting in a car with ross, we will just have to live here! 

PHOEBE:
 but if...

RACHEL:
 no you guys, i am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.

PHOEBE:
 oh good, oh joey and chandler are back. 

MONICA:
 so the going for help went well?

JOEY:
 oh yeah, smokey joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.

CHANDLER:
 i have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)

MONICA:
 then why are you smoking?

CHANDLER:
 well it’s very unsettling. 

ROSS:
 ....right? right? i mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, i mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. y'know i don’t, i don’t need them, huh, i’ve got you guys now as friends, you and susan.

CAROL:
 ah, susan will be so pleased. 

ROSS:
  where’s 717? (he gets up to return the page, carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but ross grabs the last piece.) hey, you’ve have more of these for susan right?

CAROL:
 no. but it’s okay, i’ll just put out pickles or something.  

PHOEBE:
  ross, thank god.

ROSS:
 pheebs? what, why are you whispering?

PHOEBE:
 i ate a bug. 

MONICA:
  hey rach, the tampons here are only a penny. let’s stock up. 

PHOEBE:
 listen ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.

ROSS:
 oh, now you want a favour?

PHOEBE:
 yes, please.

ROSS:
 well, oh, i’m sorry your car broke down pheebs, but i’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?

CAROL:
  phoebe, hang on a second.  here, take my car, go pick up your friends.

ROSS:
 no, i’m not gonna pick them up.

CAROL:
 listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. okay? so you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.

ROSS:
 no, rachel doesn’t want me to....

CAROL:
 look, i-i-i am sorry that rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what rachel did to you.

ROSS:
 yeah, you’re right.

CAROL:
  what?  you slept with someone else?!

ROSS:
 we were on a break!!! okay!!  we were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. where are you? i’ll find you. 

CAROL:
 you slept with another woman?

ROSS:
 oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk. 

JOEY:
 okay, done.

MONICA:
  what’s ‘pleh’?

JOEY:

MONICA:
 huh. what’s doofus spelled backwards? 

RACHEL:
  ugh!!!

PHOEBE:
 oh, it’s ross on one of his drives!

CHANDLER AND JOEY:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

JOEY:
