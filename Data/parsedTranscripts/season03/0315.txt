CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 yeah, for sure. okay. probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 ah!! okay! eyes open at all times! oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  be?

CHANDLER:
 right. right. well ah, y'know we could flip for it.

JOEY:
 yeah, i guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?

CHANDLER:
 well it you don’t know that, then i don’t want to do this with you.  

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 no, hey, well, i-i completely understand. you were, you were stressed.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 but i told you, i didn’t have the time!

ROSS:
 yeah, well you never have the time. i mean, i don’t feel like i even have a girlfriend anymore, rachel.

RACHEL:
 wh, ross what do you want from me? you want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

ROSS:
 no, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!

RACHEL:
 just a job!

ROSS:
 yes.

RACHEL:
 ross do you realise this is the first time in my life i’m doing something i actually care about. this is the first time in my life i’m doing something that i’m actually good at. i mean. if you don’t get that...

ROSS:
 no, hey, i get that, okay, i get that big time. and i’m happy for ya, but i’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! okay, i don’t know what to do anymore.

RACHEL:
 well neither do i!

ROSS:
 is this about mark?

RACHEL:
  oh my god.

ROSS:
 okay, it’s not, it’s not.

RACHEL:
 oh my god. i cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.

ROSS:
 oh i’m, i’m making this too hard. okay, what do you want me to do.

RACHEL:

CHLOE:

CHLOE:

ROSS:

CHLOE:

CHANDLER:

ISSAC:

CHLOE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MISCHA:

MISCHA:

MISCHA:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.

JOEY:
 yeah, tell that to my uncle lenny.

CHANDLER:
 why? what happened to him?

JOEY:
 nothing, he’s just really believes in that. 

RACHEL:
 oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. i just, it was awful. i told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then i told him i wanted to take a break, i don’t want to take a break.

MARK:
 wow. i’m sorry. eggroll?

RACHEL:

MARK:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MARK:

CHLOE:

ROSS:

CHLOE:
 oh, okay.   

MISCHA:

MONICA:
 oh.  can i have a tissue?

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah, sure. i just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it. 

MISCHA:
  sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.

PHOEBE:

MISCHA:
  oh, he’s unbelievable. i mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!!  you silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some english, sergei?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
  oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. be home. be home, be home, be home. oh, you’re not home. 

CHLOE:
