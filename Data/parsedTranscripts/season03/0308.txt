RACHEL:
 here you go pheebs. who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 

CHANDLER:
 i will have one.  

CHANDLER:
 okay, i’m not gonna have one.

ROSS:
 neither will i. 

PHOEBE:
 no, no, it’s just my tooth.

CHANDLER:
 all right i’ll have one. 

ROSS:
 so what’s a matter, you need a dentist? i’ve got a good one.

PHOEBE:
 no thanks, i have a good one too. i just, i, i can’t see him.

CHANDLER:
 see that is the problem with invisible dentists.

ROSS:
 why? why can’t you go to him?

PHOEBE:
 because, every time i go to the dentist, somebody dies.

CHANDLER:
 that is so weird, because every time i go to the dentist, i look down the hygienist’s blouse.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, what? umm...what?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt mary, and then there was umm, john, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘albino bob’.

RACHEL:
 and all these people actually died?

PHOEBE:
 yes, while i was in the chair! that’s why i take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, i floss to save lives!

ROSS:
 pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. it’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.

PHOEBE:
 well tell that to them. oh! you can’t, their dead. opening credits 

ROSS:
 thanks, gunther. (takes the plate gunther serves him and rachel comes up and kisses him)  umm, can i get a napkin too?

GUNTHER:
 oh, like you don’t already have everything.

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.

PHOEBE:
 all right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the tv set.

RACHEL:
 i promise.

PHOEBE:
 although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.

JOEY:
  hey, is, is, is chandler here?

ROSS:
  no, no he’s not.

MONICA:
 you guys, joey just saw janice kissing her ex-husband.

ROSS:
 what?  so what are you going to do? i mean how, how are you going to tell chandler?

JOEY:
 well, i was thinking about that and i, i think the best way would be, to not.

RACHEL:
 joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.

JOEY:
 it’ll kill him. i mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.

PHOEBE:
 well, you could wait ‘til i go to the dentist, maybe i’ll kill him. 

JOEY:
  ewww! ugly naked guy is using his new hammock. it’s like a play-doo fat factory. 

PHOEBE:
 well, i’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... all right, just look out! okay, and um, i also just wanna, i just wanna tell you all that um...... 

ROSS:
 okay, i have a problem i have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the homo sapien display.

JOEY:
 what did they do?

ROSS:
 well, they painted over the word ‘sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.

MONICA:
 so, do you want me to watch ben for you?

ROSS:
 yes, that’s what i was going to ask, thank you.

RACHEL:
 whoa! wait! hello! what about me?

ROSS:
 you? you! want to watch ben? (in the background monica mouths ‘don’t worry, i’ll be here the whole time.’ to ross.) yes! that’d be great, no, i just wanted to ask monica, because i know how empty her life is. (monica sarcastically mouths ‘yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)

JOEY:
 hey-hey, ross?

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 i’ve got a science question.

ROSS:
 hmm?

JOEY:
 if the homo sapiens, were in fact ‘homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?

ROSS:
 joey, homo sapiens are people.

JOEY:
 hey-hey, i’m not judging. 

RACHEL:
  spoon. come on! all right, y'know what i think he’s bored.

MONICA:
 here. ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show rachel? come here.  we’re gonna do something fun. okay. (throws ben up in the air a little bit and catches him) weee!! (moves into the living room and does it again) weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits ben’s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.) 

MONICA:
  who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are, you’re so brave.

RACHEL:
 okay. okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him down. come here, ben.  how could you do that to him!! ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!

MONICA:
 he’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.

RACHEL:
 we’re not?!

MONICA:
 no we’re not.

RACHEL:
 all right, i like that. 

MONICA:
 okay.

RACHEL:
 so we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam ben) aren’t we? no, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump, there’s a bump.

MONICA:
 oh my god! well push it in! push it in!

RACHEL:
 i cannot push it in!

MONICA:
 okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.

RACHEL:
 okay, okay, okay.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 okay.

MONICA:
 the second that ross walks in that door, i want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go,  rweee!!

RACHEL:
 or. we could put a hat on his head.

MONICA:
 a hat! yes! we need a hat.

RACHEL:
 we need a hat..

MONICA:
 where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

RACHEL:
 oh, oh, oh, i’ll get ‘rainy day bear’!! 

MONICA:
 because he’ll know what to do? (rachel comes out of her room with a bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) oh my god, you’re a genius!

RACHEL:
 oh god, oh god, it’s sowed on though.

MONICA:
 give it. give it.

RACHEL:

MONICA AND RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today. 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 oh, you want something serious. y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. those are dead serious.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
  no, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, you’re wrong! okay, you’re wrong.

JOEY:
 i’m not wrong! i wish i was. i’m sorry. bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?  

MONICA:
 it just makes more sense as an ensemble.

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 besides, it takes the focus off the hat.

PHOEBE:
  no! oh! you’re alive! you’re alive!

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

BEN:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

JANICE:

CHANDLER:

JANICE:

CHANDLER:

JANICE:

CHANDLER:

JANICE:

CHANDLER:

JANICE:

JANICE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
  okay. if you’re alive you answer your phone! commercial break 

MONICA:
 okay, ben, i won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.

RACHEL:
 monica, number one, i don’t think ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, i...  what?!

JOEY:
 you said number two.

RACHEL:
 i also said number one.

JOEY:
 i know. 

ROSS:
  hey! everyone.

RACHEL:
 hi!

ROSS:
 how’s my little boy?

RACHEL:
 he’s perfect, he’s never been better.

ROSS:
  what’d you do, take him whaling?

BEN:
 monica.

ROSS:
 oh my god, he just said your name, that’s great! good job ben.

BEN:
 monica bang!

MONICA:
 oh that’s right, that’s what i’d sound like if i exploded.

PHOEBE:
 woo-hoo! the curse is broken! i called everybody i know, and everyone is alive.

JOEY:
 uh.

PHOEBE:
 what?

JOEY:
 ugly naked guy looks awfully still.  

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! i killed him! i killed another one! and this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.

RACHEL:
 well maybe he’s just taking a nap.

JOEY:
 i’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.

MONICA:
 all right, we should call somebody.

ROSS:
 and tell them what? the naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.

RACHEL:
 well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.

MONICA:
 how are we gonna do that? there’s no way.

JOEY:
 well, there is one way. his window’s open, i say, we poke him. 

JOEY:
 hey! y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get chinese food?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 well, now we got a reason.

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.

CHANDLER:
 all right.

JOEY:
 hey uh, what’s a matter?

CHANDLER:
 i talked to janice.

JOEY:
 oh my god, is she going back to him?

CHANDLER:
 she doesn’t know. says she loves us both. y'know i woke up this morning and i was in love, well i was happy. y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. and now i can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!

JOEY:
 what are you ah, what are you gonna do?

CHANDLER:
 i don’t know, y'know. what, what, would you do?

JOEY:
 well, it doesn’t matter what i would do.

CHANDLER:
 come on, tell me.

JOEY:
 all right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  i would ah, i would bow out.

CHANDLER:
 what? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) what are you, what are you talking about?

JOEY:
 they have a kid together, y'know. they’re like, they’re like a family, and if, i don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, i know i wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. are you okay? do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?  

ROSS:
 well, he’s finally alseep. about that ah, bump on his head?

RACHEL:
 are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? i mean, no offense, i’ve always thought of ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.

ROSS:
 it’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, i figured you did the best you could.

RACHEL:
  i did!

ROSS:
 i know! i’m saying you have to watch them all the time.

RACHEL:
 i did!! i watched! i watched! i watched monica bang his head against that thing!

ROSS:
 monica did it? 

ROSS:
 monica?

MONICA:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 umm, did you notice anything wierd about ben today?

MONICA:
 no. why?

ROSS:
 well, i was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ it’s like they just ah, i don’t know, fell out of his head.

MONICA:
 really?!

ROSS:
 oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know...  

MONICA:
 oh my god, i wrecked your baby!! 

RACHEL:
 i hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.

MONICA:
  you jerk! you know how much i love that kid! 

ROSS:
 monica bang! monica bang!  ow!

RACHEL:
 i’ll get the hat. 

CHANDLER:
 janice, i have something i need to tell you, and i want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.

JANICE:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 i think you should go back with gary. i don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. whenever i would see him i was always think y'know ‘you’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and i hated that guy. and it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my dad.

JANICE:
 wow!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well. it’s the right thing to do.

JANICE:
 oh! you’re right. oh god. but, before i can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something i really need you to know, chandler. the way i feel about you, it’s like, i finally understand what lionel richie’s been singing about. y'know, i mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and i can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.

CHANDLER:
 then don’t leave me!

JANICE:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 forget what i said, i was babbling! pick me!

JANICE:
 no, you were right, you were right. i mean, i-i-i’ve got to give my marriage another chance.

CHANDLER:
 no you don’t! no, no, no, i say you have to give your divorce another chance.

JANICE:
 

CHANDLER:
 ohhh. don’t go.

JANICE:
 no, i-i-i gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but chandler doesn’t let her go.)

CHANDLER:
 no. no! no! no!

JANICE:
 honey, honey, people are looking.

CHANDLER:
 i don’t care!  i don’t care!!

JANICE:
 yeah, um, i’m, i’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of chandler’s grasp, she finally does, but chandler takes off her shoe.)

CHANDLER:
 you can’t leave! i have your shoe!

JANICE:
 good-bye chandler bing. 

GUNTHER:
 rachel has those in burgendy.  

JOEY:
 all right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately i have a lot of experience in that area.

ROSS:
 can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!

PHOEBE:
 i’m telling you he’s dead. what we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.

JOEY:
 all right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) steady. steady. okay, a little higher. careful of the angle. okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of ugly naked guy, so that we actually see him!) thread the needle. thread the needle.  

PHOEBE:
 he’s alive! he’s a-live!!!

MONICA:
 and yet, we’re still poking him.

JOEY:
 okay, retract the device, retract the device.

ROSS:
 he does not look happy.

RACHEL:
 hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.

JOEY:
 hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! closing credits 

CHANDLER:
  i’ll hold you close in my arms. (phoebe enters) i can’t resist your charms. and love....

PHOEBE:
  love....

CHANDLER AND PHOEBE:
 i’ll be a fool for you. i’m sure, you know i don’t mind.

CHANDLER:
  no you know i don’t mind.

CHANDLER AND PHOEBE:
 yes! you mean the world the world to me. oh...

CHANDLER:
 i know.

PHOEBE:
 i know.

CHANDLER:
 i’ve found.

PHOEBE:
 i’ve found....
