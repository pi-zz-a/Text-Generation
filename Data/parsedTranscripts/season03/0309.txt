THE GUYS:

PHOEBE:

THE GUYS:
 we will. 

MONICA:
 okay, rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.

RACHEL:
 no mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. i want to do this.  (rachel sticks a marshmellow into monica’s nose. monica takes it out of her nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)

MONICA:
 every year. opening credits 

PHOEBE:
 y'know, for once, i am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .

ROSS:
 halftime.

JOEY:
 hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?

RACHEL:
 oh! that would be sooo much fun!

PHOEBE:
 oh, can i play too? i’ve never played football, like ever. 

JOEY:
 great, you can cover chandler.

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no, i don’t, i don’t really wanna play.

JOEY:
 come on man! you never want to do anything since you and janice broke up.

CHANDLER:
 that’s not true! i wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. i wanted to start drinking in the morning. don’t say that i don’t have goals!

JOEY:
 chandler, you have to start getting over her. all right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. come on.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, all right, i’ll play.

PHOEBE:
 yay!!

RACHEL:
 let’s do it! ross?

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 do you wanna play football?

ROSS:
 um, monica and i aren’t supposed to play football.

JOEY:
 says who? your mom?

MONICA AND ROSS:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 well, every, every thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘geller bowl.’

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no, you say that proudly.

MONICA:
 anyway, ross and i were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, geller bowl vi, i accidentally broke ross’s nose.

ROSS:
 it was soo not an accident. she saw i was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. and just keep running.

MONICA:
 to score the winning touchdown, by the way.

ROSS:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.

MONICA:
  i won the game.

ROSS:
 oh yeah! then how come you didn’t get the geller cup?

RACHEL:
 um, there was a geller cup?

ROSS:
 yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. but our dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.

CHANDLER:
 and was the curse lifted?

ROSS:
 anyway. that’s when our mom said we were not to play football ever again.

MONICA:
 y'know what, i think we should play a game. i mean come on, it’s been twelve years.

ROSS:
 can i see you for a second? 

MONICA:
  once!!

ROSS:
 all right, we’re gonna play.

CHANDLER:
 but wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my mom won’t let me cross the street. 

MONICA:
 okay. let’s bring it in.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
  that almost hit me in the face.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 okay, so how do we decide that?

MONICA:
 well, why don’t we just bunny up.

RACHEL, CHANDLER, AND JOEY:

MONICA AND ROSS:
 (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) bunny!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 whoa-ho, whoa! no, i was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over janice thing you were talking about.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 okay. hut! hike! (chandler runs around behind ross, who pitches him the ball. chandler runs upfield, and joey knocks the ball out of his hands.)

JOEY:

JOEY:
 what the hell’s the matter with you?! this is my favourite jersey.

CHANDLER:
 well now you have two. hey, i am good at math.

JOEY:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 woo-yay!!

MONICA:

ROSS:
 okay, first of all, i don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know i had swollen glands!!

MONICA:

ROSS:
 oh really! why is that? 

MONICA:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?

ALL:

CHANDLER:
 okay, good. commercial break 

ROSS:
 okay, where in the hell did you get that?!

MONICA:
 when mom and dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, i swam into the lake and fished it out.

ROSS:

MONICA:
 no it’s not! you want it, you’re gonna have to win it!

RACHEL:
 all right, so are we not having dinner at all?

MONICA:
 come on phoebe, let’s go! come on, it’s time to get serious, huddle up. joey, keep your head in the game.

JOEY:
 it’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to dutch girl.

MONICA:
 all right look, if i take chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?

JOEY:
 what are you gonna do?

MONICA:
 all right, you just make sure that chandler catches the ball, i’ll take care of the rest.

JOEY:
 okay.

MONICA:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 chandler! chandler! 

CHANDLER:
  hi. 

MONICA:
 whoa! whoa!! tackled by a girl! bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?

ROSS:
 whoa! whoa! whoa! what’s with the tackling?

MONICA:
 what?! i just touched him and he went over.

ROSS:
 okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough. (they both stare each other down as we hear ‘let’s get ready to r-r-r-rum-ble!!!’)   for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration. chandler then tackles him, and he     and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. but all she ends up doing is running around   standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. something hits her on the head and   

PHOEBE:
 i love this game!! 

ROSS:
 hey, where’d you get that?

RACHEL:
 i went really long.

MONICA:
 forty-two to twenty-one! like the turkey, ross is done!

ROSS:
 it’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.

MONICA:
 you’re so pathetic! why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because i’m better than you. 

MONICA:
 oh, what a great argument, exhaling! all right, y'know what, i’ll prove it to you, okay. i’ll trade you joey for rachel, and i’ll still win the game.

ROSS:
 what?! the guys against the girls? see, that’s ridiculous monica, because i’m only down by three touchdowns.

MONICA:
 oh, then bring it on! oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.

ROSS:
 fine, fine, rachel your with monica, joey you’re with me.

RACHEL:
 i can not believe your trading me!!

MONICA:
 come on rach, come on. let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.

RACHEL:
 are you gonna let me play?

MONICA:
 all right then. 

MARGHA:
  the game is over, we eat now?

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.

JOEY:
 yeah, chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.

ROSS:
 right. okay, let’s play. let’s go.

CHANDLER:
 no ah, hold on a second joe, where do dutch people come from?

JOEY:
 ah well, the ah, pennsylvania dutch, come from pennsylvania.

CHANDLER:
 and the other ah, dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the netherlands, right?

JOEY:

MARGHA:
 oh, my.

ROSS:

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, no, no, i-i’m not playing with this guy, now.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER AND JOEY:

MARGHA:

ROSS:

MARGHA:
 well, if i had to chose right now, which by the way i find really weird, i would have to say, chandler.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 wait a minute! wait a minute! she obviously didn’t understand the question.

CHANDLER:
 well, you don’t you have captain hook explain it to her.

MARGHA:
 i’m sorry, joey, that is my chose.

CHANDLER:

MARGHA:

CHANDLER:

MARGHA:

JOEY:
 nice going. you just saved yourself a couple months of sex.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. me! from now on i get the dates and you have to stay home on saturday nights watching ready, set, cook!

ROSS:
 save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. the clock is ticking. we have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.

CHANDLER:
 we’re not gonna lose to girls.

ROSS:
 hey! it’s 42-21!

JOEY:
 this sucks, i was just up by that much!

MONICA:
 are we playing football or what? come on you hairy-backed marries. 

MONICA:
 we have to do this. we are playing for women everywhere. okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the tv while you’re making out...

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! you dated someone with a glass eye too?!

MONICA:
 come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. let’s kill ‘um!

RACHEL:
 yeah!!! kill ‘um!!!

PHOEBE:
 all right, no, well i want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?     run up field. rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she doesn’t slow him down. monica and phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop    

MONICA:
 all right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) phoebe you do a button-hook again. rachel, you go long.

RACHEL:
 no! come on! don’t make me go long. use me. they never cover me.

MONICA:
 honey, there’s a reason.

RACHEL:
 god, i’m not lame, okay. i can do something. i can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.

PHOEBE:
 come on mon, let her throw the ball.

MONICA:
 all right rachel, you sweep behind, i’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to phoebe. all right. break.

RACHEL:
 thank you! break!

MONICA:
 thirty-two! seventy-one! hike! 

THE GUYS:
 one-mississippi! two-mississippi! three-mississippi! (they all rush toward rachel, who panics and runs away. she runs out of the park and up along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past monica, as she gets to monica, she throws the ball at monica, and it hits her in the eye.)

RACHEL:
 i’m so sorry! are you okay?

MONICA:
 no! i’m not okay!

RACHEL:
 i’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and i didn’t know what to do.

JOEY:
  thirty seconds left on the timer!

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!

MONICA:
 come on! come on! hurry! we’re running out of time! huddle up!

PHOEBE:
 okay. oooh! oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.

MONICA:
 all right, phoebe get open. rachel, go long.

RACHEL:
  okay.

MONICA:
 break! (in slow motion, phoebe snaps the ball, rachel goes long. joey and chandler and all over phoebe, leaving rachel wide open. ross starts to rush monica, who sees phoebe is double covered, in desperation she throws to rachel. we see flying through the air, and then rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then rachel again, then the ball, then phoebe, chandler, and joey staring at it in shock. then with the grace of jerry rice (no offense to jerry rice), rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. both phoebe and monica erupt in celebration.)

RACHEL:
  i got a touchdown! we did it!!

CHANDLER:
 hey-hey-hey rachel, funny thing. actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!

PHOEBE:
 wait-wait-wait-wait! so, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged rachel, then isn’t the play still going. 

ROSS:
 let go! let go!

MONICA:
 let go! i’m a tiny little woman!!

CHANDLER:
 guys! guys! come on! it’s thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. the important thing is,  the dutch girl picked me! me! not you! holland loves chandler! thank you, amsterdam! good night!!

MONICA:
 ow!! closing credits  

RACHEL:
 we should defiantly play football more often. maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.

PHOEBE:
 isn’t there a national football league.

CHANDLER:
 yes. yes, there is, they play on sundays and monday nights.

RACHEL:
 oh shoot! i work monday nights.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 no! you let go!

MONICA:

ROSS:
 how come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?

MONICA:
 i don’t know. i guess the other people just don’t care enough. 

ROSS:
 hey! it’s starting to snow. (they both look up, and watch it start to snow. then they both start fighting for the ball again.)

ROSS:
 gimme the this!
