RACHEL:

MONICA:
 this bottle opener. 

RACHEL:
 and?

MONICA:
 and it’s a magnet!

RACHEL:
 look at that!

ROSS:
 how weird is that? y’know? you’re moving in with me and have the one thing i don’t have. it’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
  you complete me kitchen, matey!

PHOEBE:
 ross, i know what you’re thinking.

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 that she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. y’know? you’re just, you’re very sad.

ROSS:
 oh…my…god! i-i see what this is! you are in love with rachel!

PHOEBE:
 what?!!

ROSS:
 of course! it all adds up! i mean you you’re obsessed with her. it’s always, "ross, what are you gonna do about rachel?" "ross, why-why are you moving in with rachel?" "when are you gonna confess your secret marriage to rachel?" you want her!

PHOEBE:
 no! 

ROSS:
  hello? 

MONICA:
 hey rach, aren’t these candlesticks  mine?

RACHEL:
 no-no, i bought those.

MONICA:
 ohh! yeah, i forgot.

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

MONICA:
  that you’re a liar. (hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)

ROSS:
  no-no-no, that’s great! i’ll be there monday. and thank you again!  umm, that was the head of the paleontology department at n uh, y, uh u!

MONICA:
 wow! uh what, did he uh, say?

ROSS:
 well remember that paper i had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? they loved it. 

RACHEL:
 well, who wouldn’t?!

ROSS:
 i know! anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! i mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. how great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "professor geller."

PHOEBE:
 yeah, professor and mrs.

RACHEL:
 and mrs.?!

PHOEBE:
 oh! yeah, y’know you and ross are still married.

RACHEL:
 what?!!

PHOEBE:
 just kidding!

RACHEL:
 ohh! oh god!  

PHOEBE:
  saved your ass. opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hi.

MONICA:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 oh, what’s the matter?

PHOEBE:
 well, you know that psychic i see?

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

PHOEBE:
 well, she told me that i’m gonna die this week, so i’m kinda bummed about that.

CHANDLER:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and i know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.

MONICA:
 phoebe that’s crazy!

JOEY:
 i can’t believe she would say that too you.

RACHEL:
 yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?

PHOEBE:
 i don’t—she said y’know that i’d have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black.

CHANDLER:
 just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?

PHOEBE:
 no, ‘cause she didn’t tell me i was gonna die until the very end of the session, and i was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! i mean i’ve only got a week left, y’know? i’ve really gotta start living now! (so she picks up the latest copy of car and driver , leans back, and starts reading.)

ROSS:
  hey everyone!

CHANDLER:
 oh hi!

ROSS:
 hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and i kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind? 

ALL:
 oh that’d be great. sure!

ROSS:
  "there are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…"

PHOEBE:
 oh, this is it. this what’s gonna kill me.

ROSS:
  "…subcategories. the first of these subcategories is…"

JOEY:
  uh ross! are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?

ROSS:
 no! why?

JOEY:
 well, i’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.

ROSS:
 ohh! okay! okay.  "there are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.  each of these theories  into…"

CHANDLER:
 why don’t you open with a joke?

ROSS:
 open with a joke? it’s a university, not a comedy club!

CHANDLER:
 wait a minute, hold the phone! you’re not talking about chuckles university?!

ROSS:
  okay!

ALL:
 ohh! we’re kidding! oh, we’re kidding!

RACHEL:
 ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?

ROSS:
 thank you!

RACHEL:
 some uh, some visual aides.

JOEY:
 oh-ooh-ooh! y’know what’s a good visual aide?

ROSS:
 please don’t say naked chicks.

JOEY:
 why not?!

ROSS:
 i-i-i don’t even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it. y’know what? i’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.

CHANDLER:
 that’s the way i did it ‘til i was 19.  

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey! any good mail?

CHANDLER:
 yes, you got something from the screen actor’s guild.

JOEY:
 ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, i’m kinda….

CHANDLER:
  "benefits lapsed."

JOEY:
 hmm that’s weird. i don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.

CHANDLER:
 okay, it’s not a check. they’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.

JOEY:
 let me see that!

CHANDLER:
 all right.

JOEY:
  oh, i can’t believe this! this sucks! when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? and it wouldn’t matter. now i gotta be careful?!

CHANDLER:
 i’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.

JOEY:
 all right well, i guess i gotta go get a job. i’m gonna go see my agent.

CHANDLER:
 okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.

JOEY:
  …look both ways before you cross the street.  

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey pheebs, you’re still alive! how are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. ohh, by the way, do you think you could—(groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)

RACHEL:
 pheebs, what-what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 i was preparing you for my—didn’t you think i was dead? did that not come off?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. i thought we’d lost you forever. pheebs, you lie down?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, thanks. and listen, can you do me a favor? could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can. (phoebe goes and lies down as rachel opens the drawer monica hid the candlesticks in and as monica walks out of her room.)

RACHEL:
 monica!

MONICA:
 hmm? 

RACHEL:
 did-did you take these back?

MONICA:
 no-no, i-i just, i liked them so much that i went out and bought some for myself.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, they’re really great! aren’t they?

MONICA:
 i loved them!

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

ROSS:
  hello!

MONICA:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey!

MONICA:
 how’d the lecture go?

ROSS:
 it went great! and i didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!

RACHEL:
 wow, that’s great ross, i’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.

ROSS:
 i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself. everyone’s all, "ross you have to be funny and sexy." well, i proved them wrong! and now, i’m gonna pass the news onto joey and chandler.

MONICA:
 that you’re not funny or sexy?

ROSS:
 that’s right! 

JOEY:
  hey estelle, listen…

ESTELLE:
 well! well! well! joey tribbiani! so you came back huh? they think they can do better but they all come crawling back to estelle!

JOEY:
 what are you talkin’ about? i never left you! you’ve always been my agent!

ESTELLE:
 really?!

JOEY:
 yeah!

ESTELLE:
 oh well, no harm, no foul.

JOEY:
 estelle, you gotta get me some work. i-i lost my health insurance.

ESTELLE:
 all right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.

JOEY:
 why?

ESTELLE:
 well, i think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.

JOEY:
 bastard!  

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
  hey! so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and i’ll have my health insurance back in no time.

CHANDLER:
 that’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?

JOEY:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 what’s wrong with you?

JOEY:
 nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. but um, i don’t think it’s anything serious.

CHANDLER:
 this sounds like a hernia. you have to—you-you go to the doctor!

JOEY:
 no way! ‘kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (rolls over and shows chandler.)

CHANDLER:
 that’s a hernia.

JOEY:
 why did i have to start working out again? (looks at the weights he was using.) damn you 15s!  

RACHEL:
 well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.

MONICA:
 yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.

RACHEL:
 yeah, we could. oh hey look! there’s some kappa kappa deltas! i was a kappa.  wow, we really are bitches. (they enter the lecture hall to find ross speaking in an english accent for some unknown reason.)

ROSS:
  right! so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! what he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. imagine his consternation when— oh bloody hell. commercial break  

MONICA:
 what the hell are you doing?!

ROSS:
 look, i was nervous! you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring! i got up there and they were all like staring at me. i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out.

RACHEL:
 yeah, and not a very good one.

ROSS:
 will you-will you please? 

THE PROFESSOR:
 dr. geller, kurt rathman, i’m a professor in the paleontology department here.

ROSS:
 oh.

THE PROFESSOR:
 do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?

ROSS:
  i’m sorry, i’ve got plans with my sister.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
  right, will you excuse us for one moment? (takes monica aside.)  what are you doing?

MONICA:
  oh, you can have an accent and i can’t?! (to an exiting student in accent.) top ‘o the morning to ya laddies!

ROSS:
 just please stop! 

RACHEL:
  yes, yes, bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.  his hernia, is returning with coffee for them both. after a series of grunts and groans he 

CHANDLER:
 hey, will you grab me a cruller?  sit down! will you go to the hospital?!

JOEY:
 dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.

CHANDLER:
 i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.

JOEY:
 thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i don’t want that hanging over my head. okay? besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want! yeah, i’m thinking i’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too. 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 what’s going on?

CHANDLER:
 oh joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!

JOEY:
 look, i’m telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here (he puts his hand down his pants, like al bundy on married…with children always used to do.) it doesn’t hurt that bad.

PHOEBE:
 hey! maybe you’ll die!

JOEY:
 sure, now i’m scared.

PHOEBE:
 no, we can go together! just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘cause i’m outta here sometime before friday.

JOEY:
 yeah, but i don’t wanna die!

PHOEBE:
 no-no, it’ll be fun! we can come back and we can haunt these guys!  

MONICA:
 gimme ‘em!

RACHEL:
 no! they are mine!

MONICA:
 you stole them from me!

RACHEL:
 you stole them from me!!

MONICA:
 gimme them! (with one last mighty tug the combatants lose their grip and split, each holding one candlestick.)

MONICA:
 you just wanna each take one?

RACHEL:
 yeah that seems fair. we never use them.

ROSS:
  look, i really need some help, okay? why? why did i have to speak in a british accent?! what do i do?

RACHEL:
 well…

MONICA:
 why don’t you phase it out? yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in america.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i mean, come on ross, no one will even notice. i mean they’re probably not even listening!

ROSS:
 they’re not listening too me?

RACHEL:
 of course they’re listening to you! everybody listens to you.

ROSS:
 monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing?

MONICA:
 i think you look fine.

CASTING DIRECTOR #1:

JOEY:

THE DIRECTOR:

JOEY:
 hi alex!  and uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. 

THE DIRECTOR:
 okay.  all right uh, alex now when joey says his line, "take good care of your momma son," that’s your cue to cry. got it? (alex nods yes.) all right, let’s do this. 

A CREW MEMBER:
  scene 5, take 1.

THE DIRECTOR:
 and action!

JOEY:
 "take could care of your momma son." (alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "take could care of your momma son."  "come on son! your momma’s good people!"

THE DIRECTOR:

ALEX:

RACHEL:
  hello? 

RUSSELL:
  hello, is ross there?

RACHEL:
 uh no, he’s not. can i take a message?

RUSSELL:
 yes, this russell, ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since i haven’t heard from him, i assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.

RACHEL:
 ross got married again—nooooooo!!!!!!!!! 

ROSS:
  all right, keep going. we are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. so without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the british way) the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . were there any questions at this point? (one student raises his hand.) yes. 

A STUDENT:
 what’s happening to your accent?

ROSS:
   all right, i’m-i’m not english. i’m from long island. i was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. i’m sorry. so, if we could just get back to the lecture. umm, were there any questions?  about paleontology.  all right, look i was just trying to make a good first impression. obviously, i screwed up. but what you guys think of me is really important because i’m-i’m hoping to get a permanent job here. so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression… (at this moment rachel bursts through the door. needless to say, she’s not in the best of moods having just found out ross’s dirty little secret.)

RACHEL:
 ross!! are you crazy?! i am still your wife!! what, were you just never gonna tell me?!! what the hell is wrong with you?!!!! ugh, i could just kill you!!!!

ROSS:
  well, hello rachel! ending credits  rather disgusting scene, joey wants phoebe to beat him senseless. (luckily it isn’t a long trip.) because he’s made a miraculous recovery from his hernia and wants to take advantage of all those free surgeries he can get now since he’s re-established his 

PHOEBE:
 have you really done this before?

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah! yeah! you just take a big, big swing. now, don’t hold back.  and phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as chandler and monica enter.)

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey!

CHANDLER:
 what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 we’re just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.
