CHANDLER:
  whoa, she's pretty. 

JOEY:
  yeah, and oh she's really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.

RACHEL:
  i'm sorry, what?

MONICA:
  what?

ROSS:
  excuse me?

JOEY:
  it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)

CHANDLER:
  oh, ok.

JOEY:
  there's my scene, there's my scene.   "mrs. wallace, i'm dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..."   

JOEY:
  vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (he goes into a song and dance number.)   all you want is a dingle,   what you envy's a schwang,   a thing through which you can tinkle,   or play with, or simply let hang...   and it's also on the soundtrack.  he's joey telling everyone about his big break in 

JOEY:
  i play al pacino's butt. all right? he goes into the shower, and then- i'm his butt. 

MONICA:
  oh my god. 

JOEY:
  c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big! 

CHANDLER:
 oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. 

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
  over the line?! you-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! the line is a dot to you! 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JANICE:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 do you think he’ll ever forgive me?

RACHEL:
 of course he will! but chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!

CHANDLER:
 y’know what? i-i kinda have.

RACHEL:
 already? that’s pretty bad what you did.

MONICA:
 y’know what? he will forgive you. and i like to bring a pad with me when i go answer the phone just in case… (chandler gets that disgusted look back.) okay…

CHANDLER:
 you didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?

RACHEL:
 i’m sure he will forgive you. look, we have all been there! y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.  

ROSS:

ROSS:
 i didn’t know what i was taking full responsibility for! okay?! i didn’t finish the whole letter!

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 y'know i can’t believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!

ROSS:
  fine by me!! (he opens the door and traps chandler behind it)

RACHEL:
 and hey! just so you know, it’s not that common! it doesn’t happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!

CHANDLER:
  i knew it!!!!  part ii.  monica and rachel are fighting over who gets to see jean-claude van 

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 i did not sell you out.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh!  all right.  now, let's not do this! 

PHOEBE:
 happy thoughts!  happy thoughts! (they wrestle on the couch for a little while until monica gets the upper hand and pulls rachel off of the couch by her sock.  monica removes rachel's sock and starts beating her with it.)this leads to wrestling on the floor. this finally angers phoebe.)

PHOEBE:

MONICA AND RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 yeah. whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. i ah, i better not do any, i don't know, lunges.     it's the sequence where joey and chandler are both saddened that they're not living       through a rainy window. the camera zooms out to show it's just his tabletop water   

CHANDLER:
 joey? got you a joey special, two pizzas! joe? (the phone rings and he answers it)  hello?

JOEY:
 wow!  well then i’ll just have to carry you. (suddenly ross jumps up from behind the counter armed with a plastic gun. by the way, he’s overacting too.)

ROSS:
 that’ll be a neat trick, when you’re,  when you’re dead!

JOEY:
 ross, you don’t have to yell.

ROSS:
 there was just an explosion, okay? my hearing would be impaired. 

PHOEBE:
 i thought you were excellent! in fact for a minute there i was like, "ooh, where’d ross go?"

ROSS:
 thank you! and i have to say that first scene when you meet mac…

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

ROSS:
 oh my god. i mean…

JOEY:
