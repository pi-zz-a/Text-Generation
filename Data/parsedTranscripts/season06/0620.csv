joey| yeah, i thought i was pretty good too.
phoebe| oh yeah, you’re solid. yeah, you’re just no me.
joey| y’know what? i think that’s enough for now. yeah. i don’t want to be over rehearsed.

rachel| so mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.
joey| that’s the title! yeah! y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.

phoebe| i am.
rachel| joey, what are you talking about? you’re a terrific actor.
joey| you really think so?
rachel| ugh, how can you even ask that question?!  flashbacks from previous episodes. the first set of auditions feature high lights or low   
chandler|  whoa, she's pretty. 
joey|  yeah, and oh she's really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
rachel|  i'm sorry, what?
monica|  what?
ross|  excuse me?
joey|  it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)
chandler|  oh, ok.
joey|"  there's my scene, there's my scene.   ""mrs. wallace, i'm dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a...""   "
joey|  vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (he goes into a song and dance number.)   all you want is a dingle,   what you envy's a schwang,   a thing through which you can tinkle,   or play with, or simply let hang...   and it's also on the soundtrack.  he's joey telling everyone about his big break in 
joey|  i play al pacino's butt. all right? he goes into the shower, and then- i'm his butt. 
monica|  oh my god. 
joey|  c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big! 
chandler| oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. 
joey| okay, okay, fine! make jokes, i don't care! this is a big break for me! 
ross| you're right, you're right, it is.
monica|  yes.

chandler| so it did go well.
joey| oh, it went amazingly well!

chandler| well, it is overdue.
ross| look, don’t worry. okay? you’re gonna be fine.
joey| there’s just so much pressure. i mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. i don’t know if you’d understand.
ross| yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.   
chandler|  yes, fran. i know what time it is, but i'm looking at the wenus and i'm not happy!  
monica|  alright, well i'm tearing the lettuce.

all|  ohhhhhh!
ross|  oh my god!
phoebe|  and all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (the flashback shows paulo rolling over and showing phoebe his equipment.)
monica|  was it...
phoebe|  oh, boy scouts could've camped under it!

chandler| as crazy as soccer?  
joey|  what are you talking about? the
audition’s not ‘til 5|00! (chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as joey listens.) well, nobody told me!  who’d you talk to? (listens and turns around to see chandler trying to finish the message.) nevermind! 
chandler| you mean you didn’t get it from this?
joey| the allergy guy got the part! thanks!
chandler| well, maybe we can fix it y’know? maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
joey| how could you do this to me chandler?! this part could’ve turned my whole career around!
chandler| i messed up. okay? i’m sorry, i really messed up.
joey| hey, you don’t even live here anymore! what are you doing answering my phone? i have my machine!
chandler| which i bought for ya. taught ya how to use it. you thought it was a copier. look, if there was anything i could do, i would do it. okay? but everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?  starts. the first flashback is from the one with the prom video.  it's chandler telling phoebe how much he hates the bracelet joey bought 
chandler|  you know he coulda gotten me a vcr, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  the eyesore from the liberace house of crap!
phoebe|  it's not that bad.
chandler|  oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the mr. t collection. 
phoebe|  chandler, chandler.
chandler|  i pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, i do, i do. i pity the fool that. . .   
chandler|  yeah, i mean when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking, and one thing to another and…

chandler|  you’re right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line.
joey|  over the line?! you-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! the line is a dot to you! 
chandler| look, i’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! but you’re not perfect! you’ve made some errors in judgment too!
joey| name one!  first flashback is from the one with the cat.   chandler has just returned home to see that their apartment has been cleaned out and finds 
chandler|  what happened?!!
joey|  awww, man! he promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!

chandler| ...and what did you bring?
lorraine| she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for janice.
chandler| janice? (lorraine leaves. joey shakes his head as though to say, 'it can't be the same janice.' janice enters.)
chandler| janice?!
janice| oh.... my.... god.  girlfriend.  chandler is telling ross and joey that joey's tailor took advantage 
chandler| joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
ross| what?
joey| no way!  i've been going to the guy for 12 years.
chandler| oh come on!  he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
ross| what?
chandler| cupping.
joey| that's how they do pants!  ross, will you tell him? isn't that how they measure pants?
ross| yes, yes it is. in prison! 
joey| i said name one! commercial break 
chandler| i can’t believe i did this! what an idiot!
monica| oh, stop beating yourself up! people make mistakes! these things happen! there aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? (chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) apparently you’re not very good at it! i…
chandler| do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
rachel| of course he will! but chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
chandler| y’know what? i-i kinda have.
rachel| already? that’s pretty bad what you did.
monica| y’know what? he will forgive you. and i like to bring a pad with me when i go answer the phone just in case… (chandler gets that disgusted look back.) okay…
chandler| you didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?
rachel| i’m sure he will forgive you. look, we have all been there! y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.  
ross| it took two people to break up this relationship!!
rachel| yeah! you and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
ross| i didn’t know what i was taking full responsibility for! okay?! i didn’t finish the whole letter!
rachel| what?!!
ross| i fell asleep!
rachel|  you fell asleep?!
ross| it was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. front and back!!   oh-oh-oh, and by the way, y-o-u-apostrophe-r-e means ‘you are,’ y-o-u-r means ‘your!’
rachel| y'know i can’t believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
ross|  fine by me!! (he opens the door and traps chandler behind it)
rachel| and hey! just so you know, it’s not that common! it doesn’t happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!
chandler|  i knew it!!!!  part ii.  monica and rachel are fighting over who gets to see jean-claude van 
monica| you had no right to go out with him.
rachel| that is the most ridiculous...
monica| you sold me out.
rachel| i did not sell you out.
monica| yes you did.  you absolutely sold me...
rachel| would you let me talk. 
monica| did you just flick me?
rachel| ok, well, you wouldn't let me finish and i was jus-   ow. that hurt  
phoebe| oh!  all right.  now, let's not do this! 
phoebe| happy thoughts!  happy thoughts! (they wrestle on the couch for a little while until monica gets the upper hand and pulls rachel off of the couch by her sock.  monica removes rachel's sock and starts beating her with it.)this leads to wrestling on the floor. this finally angers phoebe.)
phoebe| ok, now i'm gonna kick some ass.  
monica and rachel| ow! ow! ow!
phoebe| i know!  i know!  i know! 
phoebe| alright, now i will let go if you both stop.

joey| yeah. whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. i ah, i better not do any, i don't know, lunges.     it's the sequence where joey and chandler are both saddened that they're not living       through a rainy window. the camera zooms out to show it's just his tabletop water   
chandler| joey? got you a joey special, two pizzas! joe? (the phone rings and he answers it)  hello? (takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) damnit!  no, joey’s not here right now, but i can take a message i think.  he’s still got a chance for the part?! oh, that’s great news!  well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.  oh well, that’s great. i will give joey the message. thank you!

chandler| i think so. yeah, get off me.

phoebe|  i can’t! my circuits are fried! they’re fried i tell you!!
joey| wow!  well then i’ll just have to carry you. (suddenly ross jumps up from behind the counter armed with a plastic gun. by the way, he’s overacting too.)
ross| that’ll be a neat trick, when you’re,  when you’re dead!
joey| ross, you don’t have to yell.
ross| there was just an explosion, okay? my hearing would be impaired. 
phoebe|" i thought you were excellent! in fact for a minute there i was like, ""ooh, where’d ross go?"""
ross| thank you! and i have to say that first scene when you meet mac…
phoebe| yeah?
ross| oh my god. i mean…
joey| y’know what? i think that’s enough for today. thanks for your help! 
phoebe|  he’s holding us back.
