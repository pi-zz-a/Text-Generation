chandler:" you're right, by saying ""nice"" i'm virtually licking her."
ross: hey, i hear she's single again, d'you think i should ask her out?
chandler: are you asking permission to break the pact?
ross: yes please.   
ross: hey. hey, check out the flyers for the band. i made 'em on a macintosh in the computer room!

chandler: totally. i had sex in high school...
ross: me too. i'm good at it.
chandler: all right, i'd say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.
ross: you got it.
chandler: all right, so that's missy goldberg, phoebe cates and molly ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
ross: those are the pacts!
chandler: oh, and sheena easton. but we probably couldn't get her anyway.
ross: oh, oh... maybe not you!   
chandler: well, i officially give you permission to break the pact.
ross: thank you.  all right, here i go. hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
chandler: your hands are shaking.
ross: i know, and i can't stop sweating.

missy: so how come it took you so long to ask me out?
ross: oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate chandler bing?
missy:" sure, he was in your ""band""? "
ross: it's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
missy: sorry.
ross: that's ok. uh, anyway, well he and i both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
missy: really?
ross: yeah, why?
missy: well, chandler and i used to make out! a lot!
ross: you did?
missy: yeah. we'd go to the science lab after hours!

monica: ...if-you-say-so. 
roy: so where's the young lady who i'm supposed to take 
phoebe: oh, god!

phoebe: rachel?
rachel: yeah?
phoebe: are you kidding?
rachel: all right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
phoebe: how old is your phonebook?
monica: oh my god, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
phoebe: oh god no, i don't wanna see him take his clothes off!

phoebe: this is how i look when i'm turned on!
roy: you were talking about me before! look, i don't need this! i'm outta here! where's my hat?  look, i've been in this business for a long time!
phoebe: shocking!
roy: now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, i'll be on my way!
phoebe: three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
rachel: no, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
phoebe: no, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
roy: didn't do anything? i took a bus all the way from hoboken. i climbed ... i dunno... like a billion stairs... it's not like i can take them two at a time! 
phoebe: i don't care. we're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
roy: well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
phoebe: oh yeah, okay. i'm uptight. yeah, that's why i don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what i can only assume is a child halloween costume! 
roy: i may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man.
phoebe: i'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
roy:  oh, you're mean!
monica:  uh, look, officer... uhm sir...

ross:  you made out with missy goldberg. how could you do that, after you promised me? 
chandler: . that didn't make us sound gay at all!
ross: you broke the pact! 
chandler: ross, that was 16 years ago!
ross: that doesn't matter! we're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
chandler: i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  all right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
ross: i didn't.
chandler: oh really?
ross: no.
chandler: oh really!?
ross: no!
chandler: adrienne turner!! 
adrienne: yes?
chandler and ross: hey! hey adrienne.

ross: listen adrienne, you can't tell chandler about this.
adrienne: oh believe me, ross, i won't be telling anybody about this.
ross: cool!    
ross: i didn't know you knew about that.
chandler:" well, i did and it hurt.  that's when i wrote the song: ""betrayal in the common room""."
ross:  man... i... i'm sorry.
chandler: look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
ross: so, eh. i made out with adrienne and you made out with missy. well i guess we're even.
chandler:  hmm mmmhm..
ross: we are even, right?
chandler:  just one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night that i wanted to get back at you. so i thought, who does ross like the more than anybody?
ross:  what did you do to my mom?
chandler: not her!   
rachel: i am sooo drunk.
monica: that's weird. i've had the same number of beers as you and i don't feel anything at all.

rachel:  i am soo not going to do good on my sats tomorrow. 
chandler: well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
rachel:  oh yeah. there is a plan! why don't i just start taking my smart pills now?
chandler: well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
rachel: 
chandler: so where are you applying to? 
rachel: oh well, you know, i think it's kinda really important that i go somewhere where there's sun, so i'm sort of...  hey!
chandler: i'm in college and i'm in a band. 
rachel:     
roy: what's the matter? you never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
phoebe: you know, it's fine. we'll pay you.
roy: no, no, you're right. who am i kidding? i should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. what am i gonna do? i mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. taking my clothes off in front of people is all i know.
rachel: no, wait. no there's gotta be something else that you can do. i mean, what skills do you have?
roy: i don't know... i can make my pecs dance... i can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... i can go to that special place inside me where i feel no shame.
rachel: so maybe something in an office.
phoebe: or you could teach stripping. you know, share your gift, pass the torch.
roy: you know, actually that's not a bad idea. i can do it out of my apartment. i don't think my mom would mind.
phoebe: there you go. okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
roy: yeah, yeah, yeah... this is so weird. i mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. and i didn't even get a chance to finish it.
phoebe:  finish it!
roy: what?
phoebe: your last dance. do it for us.
roy: really?
rachel:  really?
phoebe: yeah, yeah. he deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.

monica: she and phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
ross: did you know chandler kissed rachel?
monica: what? when was this?
ross: nineteen eighty seven. the weekend you guys visited me at school.
monica: oh my god! that's wild!
chandler: yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
ross: well, it matters to me.
chandler: why?
ross: because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time.
chandler: you kissed her that night too?
monica: two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
chandler: seriously, where did this happen?
ross: okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back. it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and now, now i find out that you kissed her first.
chandler: oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?
ross: mine.
chandler: i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed.
ross: no, she was definitely on my bed. 
chandler: why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
ross: well, then who was on my bed?
monica: 
ross:  no! no, no!
monica: yes! 
ross: you were under the pile of coats?
monica: i was the pile of coats!
ross: oh my god!
monica: you were my midnight mystery kisser?
ross: you were my first kiss with rachel?
monica: you were my first kiss ever?
chandler: what did i marry into?  commercial break
