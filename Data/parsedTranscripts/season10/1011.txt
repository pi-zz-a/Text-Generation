CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 you're right, by saying "nice" i'm virtually licking her.

ROSS:
 hey, i hear she's single again, d'you think i should ask her out?

CHANDLER:
 are you asking permission to break the pact?

ROSS:
 yes please.   

ROSS:
 hey. hey, check out the flyers for the band. i made 'em on a macintosh in the computer room!

CHANDLER:
 i said it first, bro.

ROSS:
 well, i thought it first, holmes.

CHANDLER:
  look, if you did...

ROSS:
 woha! wait... what are we doing? what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. i mean, we can get laid anytime we want.

CHANDLER:
 totally. i had sex in high school...

ROSS:
 me too. i'm good at it.

CHANDLER:
 all right, i'd say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.

ROSS:
 you got it.

CHANDLER:
 all right, so that's missy goldberg, phoebe cates and molly ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.

ROSS:
 those are the pacts!

CHANDLER:
 oh, and sheena easton. but we probably couldn't get her anyway.

ROSS:
 oh, oh... maybe not you!   

CHANDLER:
 well, i officially give you permission to break the pact.

ROSS:
 thank you.  all right, here i go. hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?

ROSS:
 oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate chandler bing?

MISSY:

ROSS:
 it's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.

MISSY:
 sorry.

ROSS:
 that's ok. uh, anyway, well he and i both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!

MISSY:
 really?

ROSS:
 yeah, why?

MISSY:
 well, chandler and i used to make out! a lot!

ROSS:
 you did?

MISSY:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

ROY:

PHOEBE:
 i don't care. we're not paying you 300 dollars for this.

ROY:
 well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, okay. i'm uptight. yeah, that's why i don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what i can only assume is a child halloween costume! 

ROY:
 i may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man.

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?

ROY:

ROSS:
  you made out with missy goldberg. how could you do that, after you promised me? 

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 you broke the pact! 

CHANDLER:
 ross, that was 16 years ago!

ROSS:
 that doesn't matter! we're talking about the foundation of our friendship.

CHANDLER:
 i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  all right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.

ROSS:
 i didn't.

CHANDLER:
 oh really?

ROSS:

ROSS:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 so where are you applying to? 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
     

ROY:
 what's the matter? you never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?

PHOEBE:

ROY:
 no, no, you're right. who am i kidding? i should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. what am i gonna do? i mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. taking my clothes off in front of people is all i know.

RACHEL:
 no, wait. no there's gotta be something else that you can do. i mean, what skills do you have?

ROY:
 i don't know... i can make my pecs dance... i can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... i can go to that special place inside me where i feel no shame.

RACHEL:
 so maybe something in an office.

PHOEBE:
 or you could teach stripping. you know, share your gift, pass the torch.

ROY:
 you know, actually that's not a bad idea. i can do it out of my apartment. i don't think my mom would mind.

PHOEBE:
 there you go. okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?

ROY:
 yeah, yeah, yeah... this is so weird. i mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. and i didn't even get a chance to finish it.

PHOEBE:
  finish it!

ROY:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 your last dance. do it for us.

ROY:

ROSS:
 did you know chandler kissed rachel?

MONICA:
 what? when was this?

ROSS:
 nineteen eighty seven. the weekend you guys visited me at school.

MONICA:
 oh my god! that's wild!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.

ROSS:
 well, it matters to me.

CHANDLER:
 why?

ROSS:
 because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time.

CHANDLER:
 you kissed her that night too?

MONICA:
 two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.

CHANDLER:
 seriously, where did this happen?

ROSS:
 okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back. it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and now, now i find out that you kissed her first.

CHANDLER:
 oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?

ROSS:
 mine.

CHANDLER:
 i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed.

ROSS:
 no, she was definitely on my bed. 

CHANDLER:
 why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?

ROSS:
 well, then who was on my bed?

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
  no! no, no!

MONICA:
 yes! 

ROSS:
 you were under the pile of coats?

MONICA:
 i was the pile of coats!

ROSS:
 oh my god!

MONICA:
 you were my midnight mystery kisser?

ROSS:
 you were my first kiss with rachel?

MONICA:
 you were my first kiss ever?

CHANDLER:
 what did i marry into?  commercial break
