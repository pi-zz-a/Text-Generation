monica|  mmh... this cake is amazing!
rachel| my god, get a room!
monica| i would get a room with this cake. i think i could show this cake a good time!
phoebe| if you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
monica|  sex!
chandler|  seriously, answer faster!
monica|" oh, i'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" i wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!"
chandler|  it's like a giant hug.
phoebe| ross, how about you. what would you give up, sex or food?
ross| food.
phoebe| ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
ross| oh my god. it's like sophie's choice.
rachel| oh god. what about you, joe? what would you give up, sex or food?
joey| uhm... oh... i don't know, it's too hard.
rachel| no, you gotta pick one!
joey| oh... food. no, sex. food! sex! food! se-i don't know! good god, i don't know, i want girls on bread!  opening credits 
rachel| you gotta see these latest pictures of emma.
phoebe| oh, how cute!
rachel| yeah.
phoebe| oh, she looks just like a little doll!
rachel| oh, no, no. that is a doll.
phoebe| oh, thank god, 'cause that thing's really creepy! 
rachel| oh. who is the blonde, she's pretty.
phoebe| oh! he's having an affair.
rachel| he's not having an affair!
phoebe| you know, i'm always right about these things.
rachel| no, you're not! last week you thought ross was trying to kill you!
phoebe| well, i'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  see, there's something going on with them. look, he's getting into the car with her!
rachel| oh, that doesn't mean anything.
phoebe| oh yeah? well, let's see.  
chandler|  hello.
phoebe| oh, hi chandler. it's phoebe. uhm... i know that monica is working today so... ...i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel.
chandler| oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, i'm stuck at the office all day.
phoebe|"  oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""liar, liar"" or ""betrayal"", or... ""an affair to remember""."
chandler| those are all really old!
phoebe| ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
rachel|"  ""dude, where's my car?"" "
phoebe|  what?
rachel| they're in a caaar...
phoebe|  okay, we-we'll talk to you later. okay, bye. 
rachel| geez!
phoebe| ok. quick. we gotta find a cab and follow them.
rachel| oh, yeah, ok. let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
phoebe|  i got them!   
chandler| hi!
monica| hey! you smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
chandler| i was in the car with nancy all day.
monica| nancy doesn’t smoke!
chandler| well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
monica| so? what do you think of the house?
chandler| it’s perfect. it’s everything we’ve been looking for.
monica| isn’t it? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
chandler| and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  what were the things you said?
monica| don’t you love the huge yard?
chandler| and the fireplace in the bedroom.
monica| and nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
chandler| this is bringing out a lovely color in you!
monica| so? do you think we should get it?
chandler| i don’t know. what do you think?
monica| i think we should.
chandler| i do too.
monica| this is huge!
chandler| i know.
monica| how bad you wanna smoke, right now.
chandler| i don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day.
monica| gotcha. when do we tell them about this?
chandler| we don’t. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
monica| okay. right. oh my god that is gonna be so hard.
chandler| i know. gooooood luck with it.   
ross| i just can’t see chandler cheating!
rachel| i’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
joey| chandler? forty-five minutes? well, something is not right. i just can’t believe he would do this to monica!
ross| i know, and with the baby coming?
phoebe| so, should we tell her?
ross| i don’t know. phoebe, if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
phoebe| why? who’d you seen him with?
ross| no one, i’m just saying if... 
phoebe| tell me what you know!
ross|  i know nothing! mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
phoebe| all right. . he is a good guy. you’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
ross| believe me, if i did see with someone, there’s no way i... 
phoebe | who did you see him with?   
rachel| oh, look at her, so happy!
monica| if only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
joey| hey, is uhm... is chandler here?
monica| no, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
phoebe| well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
monica | all right...
ross| we think chandler might be having an affair.
monica| what?
rachel| phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester.
phoebe| they went in together. so sorry.
monica| oh my god! oh my god that’s awful! what did you think of the house? 
phoebe| what?
joey|  monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
monica| yeah, sure... uhm, i'm devastated, obviously... 
chandler| hey!
joey|  you son of a bitch!
chandler| is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
monica|  phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
rachel| who's nancy?
ross| what's going on?
monica|  ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
chandler| yeah  i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.
joey| i knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
phoebe| why do you have a realtor?
monica| uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
joey|  what?
rachel| are you serious?
monica| when we found out that we're gonna get this baby, chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
phoebe| so you're gonna move?
ross| oh my god.
joey| shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
rachel| what is wrong with raising a kid in the city? i'm doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker is doing it!
monica| and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
chandler| ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
ross|  so you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
phoebe| have you thought about what you would be giving up? you can't move out of the city, what if you want chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door?
ross| you know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
joey| no, no, it's not, don't listen to him! 
ross| , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be. 
chandler| actually, we already found a house we love.
ross| what?
monica| and about an hour ago, we made an offer. 
chandler| bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh? time lapse
ross| you put an offer on a house? 
monica| 
phoebe| wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers?
chandler| i know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
joey| is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food?  i really, really think i can! 
chandler| 
monica| we think if you saw it, you'd understand. i mean you guys were there.  it is beautiful, isn't it?
rachel| yeah it is.
joey| what the hell are you doin'?
rachel| well, it is, all right? when we were out there today, all i kept thinking was: i can't believe chandler is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice place to live!
phoebe| yeah, but so is this.
ross| yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. i mean, how can you leave this place?    
rachel|  c'mon daddy, listen to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i don't want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying that i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy!
ross| you can see where he'd have trouble.
rachel| well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. 
monica| well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica...   
ross| that money is mine, green!
rachel| you're fly is open, geller!
phoebe| you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?
chandler| hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'c'!   
phoebe|  
rachel| ow, that had to hurt!   
phoebe| hey, it’s your thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
the guys| we will. 
monica| okay, rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
rachel| no mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. i want to do this.  
monica| every year.   
joey|  it's stuck!!!
phoebe|  easy. step. how did it get on?
joey| i put it on to scare chandler!
phoebe| oh my god! monica's gonna totally freak out!
joey| it smells really bad in here.
phoebe| well, of course it smells really bad. you have your head inside a turkey's ass! 
monica| hey, did you get the turkey bast-oh my god! oh my god!  who is that?
joey| it's joey.   
monica| i got it! how about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
rachel| oooohh that’s interesting.
chandler| if you win, we give up the birds.
joey| 
chandler| but if we win, we get your apartment.
joey| oooooh!
monica| deal! time lapse

ross| 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
monica| it’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
rachel| oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
monica| that’s not even a word! 
monica| nooooooooo!!!!! time lapse 
rachel| y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
joey| hey, don’t get mad at us! no one forced you to raise the stakes!
rachel| that is not true. she did! she forced me!
monica| hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
rachel| well it stupid, unfair question!
ross| don’t blame the questions!
chandler| would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!   
ross| chandler!!! chandler!!!  chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister! now get out here!

joey|  dude! he's right there!
ross|  i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this!
chandler| look, we're not just messing around! i love her. okay, i'm in love with her.
monica| i'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. i'm sorry, but iit-t's true, i love him too. 
ross|     
monica|" well, this is the last box of your clothes. i’m just gonna label it, ""what were you thinking?"""
rachel| funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler.
phoebe| ok, you guys, i don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, i don’t want to live with rachel anymore.
monica and rachel| what?!
phoebe| you’re just so mean to each other! and i don’t want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!
rachel| well, phoebe that’s fine because i’m not moving.
monica| whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! y’know, i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i’d like.
phoebe| what else?
monica| when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
rachel| yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.
phoebe| that’s nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.
monica| when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
rachel| well y’know, i don’t want you to be cold.
monica| and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive.  time lapse 
chandler|  hey.
monica| she really left.
chandler| i know. 
monica| thank you.
chandler| no problem roomie. 
monica| can i ask you a question?
chandler| sure!
monica| what the hell is that dog doing here?!    
chandler| little toast here. i know this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.
all| that's so sweet.
ross| and hey, here's to a lousy christmas.
rachel| and a crappy new year.
chandler| here, here!   
rachel| you can't move. you just... you just can't.
joey| rachel's right. this is where you guys belong. 
phoebe| yeah, you don't wanna live in westchester. that's like the worst of the chesters.
ross| you know, sometimes when i'm alone in my apartment, i look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching tv or something, but... it makes me feel better. and now when i look over, who am i gonna see? the gottliebs, the yangs? they don't make me feel so good. 
rachel| yeah. so don't move, okay? just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night. 
chandler| hello? it's nancy, they responded to our offer.
monica| and? 
chandler|  they passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
monica| we can't afford that.
chandler| i know.
monica| well, there you go. 
joey| i'm really sorry you guys.
ross| yeah. i'm sorry too. i'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before i told you about looking through the window.
rachel| yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
phoebe|  you're gonna be okay?
monica| yeah, we'll be okay.
ross| love you guys. 
joey| you know, i'm really sorry i wasn't more supportive before.
chandler| that's okay, we understand.
joey| and about this nancy thing... if you're not sleeping with her, should i? 
monica| i know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... i love that one so much.
chandler| yeah... well, it's a good thing we got it then.
monica| what?
chandler| we got the house.
monica| oh my god!
chandler| i just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
monica| oh my god! my god! we've got the house !?
chandler| we're getting the house.  we're getting the house.
monica| and a baby...
chandler| we're growing up.
monica| we sure are.
chandler| so who's gonna tell them?
