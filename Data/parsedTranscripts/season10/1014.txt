MIKE:
  thank you guys for having us over.

PHOEBE:
 oh! yeah, this is fun, couples night.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.

MONICA:
 well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.

CHANDLER:
 you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. 

ROSS:
  hey, you guys... i have great news.

MONICA:
 ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.

ROSS:
 oh, well, er, i already ate, but sure...!  guess what happened at work today...

CHANDLER:
 a dinosaur died a million years ago?

ROSS:
 try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... my tenure review board met today and i hear it's looking really good.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 hey mon? was it weird changing your name to geller-bing?

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 where did you go to do it?

MONICA:
 uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...

CHANDLER:
 you never did it!

MONICA:
 i'm sorry. it's just the idea of being an official bing.

CHANDLER:

MIKE:
  here you go.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, come with us. you'll see how close it is to the city.

JOEY:

MONICA:
  i'll pick you up at eleven. so glad you're coming.

PHOEBE:
 good for you. that was really mature.

JOEY:
 what? no, the only reason  i'm going to their stupid new house, is so i can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. i'm gonna make them stay here.

MIKE:
 you're a strange kind of grown-up.

PHOEBE:
 joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. believe me, there's something i've been trying to get mike to do in bed and there's... he's just... 

MIKE:
 woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... can we not talk about that right now?

PHOEBE:
 all right, prude... look, monica and chandler really love this house. you are not gonna talk them into staying here.

JOEY:
 hey, hey... i can convince people to do anything, you know. i bet i can even get mike to do that "thing". what is it? 

JOEY:
 i am not gonna help you do that! goodbye!    

RACHEL:
  hi, i'm here to see mr campbell... with gucci. the reservation is probably under gucci. it's spelled like gukki, which could be confusing.

MAITRE D':
 mr campbell's not here yet. let me show you to his table.  

RACHEL:
 oh my god! that's my boss. you have to seat us somewhere else.

MAITRE D':
 i'm sorry. that's always mr campbell's table.

RACHEL:

MR CAMPBELL:

RACHEL:
  whatever happened to just singing for  no reason? huh?

MR CAMPBELL:

RACHEL:

MR CAMPBELL:

RACHEL:

MR CAMPBELL:

MR CAMPBELL:

MR CAMPBELL:

PHOEBE:

CLERK:
 how can i help you? 

PHOEBE:
 i need to change my name, please. see, i need to change it because i'm-i'm hiding from the law.  you're fun.

CLERK:
 you need to fill out this form.  

PHOEBE:
 okay, well, i just don't, i don't know how it works exactly. see, my name is buffay and my husband's name is hannigan, so is it supposed to be buffay-hannigan or hannigan-buffay?

CLERK:
 it can be anything you want.

PHOEBE:
 well, not anything, i mean...

CLERK:
 yeah... anything.

PHOEBE:
 oh, this could take a while.

CLERK:
 get out of my line.

PHOEBE:
 okay.   

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 oh, not anymore. i changed it today.

MONICA:
 oh, i'm sorry, mrs hannigan.

PHOEBE:
 wrong again! apparently you can change it to anything you want. so i thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. so meet princess consuela banana hammock.

CHANDLER:
 that's what we were gonna name the baby.

MONICA:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 uh! princess consuela.

MONICA:
 you seriously changed your name to that?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh! 

MONICA:
 okay, so from now on we have to call you princess consuela?

PHOEBE:
 uhm, no. i'm gonna have my friends call me valerie. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, how'd the interview go?

RACHEL:
 oh! it's not good.

CHANDLER:
 you know, i always feel that way after an interview. i'll bet it went better than you think.

RACHEL:
 well, i didn't get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren.

CHANDLER:
 that is a bad interview.

PHOEBE:
 what are you, what are you talking about? how did this happen?

RACHEL:
 well, my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview and he heard everything. so later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because i'm not a team player. and i said "wait a minute! yes i am." and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true. 

MONICA:
 oh god. i'm so sorry. 

ROSS:
 hey! wha-hoo! what's this?  well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. why is this here?

PHOEBE:
 ross...

ROSS:
 i guess it's here because i got tenure! all 

ROSS:
 this is the single greatest day of my professional career. gunther, six glasses!

GUNTHER:
 six? you want me to join you?

ROSS:
 oh, i thought joey was here. five is good.  well, i'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. 

CHANDLER:
 ooh! israeli champagne. and it's vanilla!

ROSS:
 i got tenure. i didn't win the lottery... hey rach, so uh... how did your thing go?

RACHEL:
 oh it... good! yeah, but i'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.

ROSS:
 oh, you know what? you're gonna get it. i-i-i-i can feel it.

PHOEBE:
 can you?

RACHEL:
 ah, all right. here's to ross!

ROSS:
 and-and to years of hard work finally paying off.

PHOEBE:
 and to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. 

ROSS:
 but also knowing it means a lot.

MONICA:
 but more importantly to full well-rounded lives.

ROSS:
 ...that center around work.

CHANDLER:
 to ross!

ALL :
 ross! 

ROSS:
 you know what the best part about this is? i can never be fired.

PHOEBE:
 oh god!

ROSS:
 no seriously. i have job security for life. you know, i never have to worry.  oh, look at you. look  how happy you are for me.

RACHEL:
  no, it's not that. i got fired today. and i didn't get the other job.

ROSS:
 rach, i'm so sorry.

RACHEL:
 oh!

ROSS:
 great. i feel like an idiot.

RACHEL:
 no, it's okay, you didn't know.

ROSS:
 oh...  little heads-up would have been nice.   

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 fungus! yeah. place is full of it.

MONICA:
 no it's not. we had an inspection and they didn't find anything.

JOEY:
 okay. then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.

MONICA:
 maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.

JOEY:
 maybe. so this is the living room huh? ooh, it's pretty dark.  

MONICA:
 no it's not!

JOEY:
  are you kiddin'? i think i just saw a bat in the corner!

CHANDLER:
 when your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

JOEY:
  maybe. well, i just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? or any other house for that matter.

MONICA:
 oh joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here. 

JOEY:
 fine, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? i just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... 

MONICA:
 joey, we know that's you.

JOEY:
