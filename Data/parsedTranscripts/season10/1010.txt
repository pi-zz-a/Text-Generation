CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 you know, i'm always right about these things.

RACHEL:
 no, you're not! last week you thought ross was trying to kill you!

PHOEBE:
 well, i'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  see, there's something going on with them. look, he's getting into the car with her!

RACHEL:
 oh, that doesn't mean anything.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah? well, let's see.  

CHANDLER:
  hello.

PHOEBE:
 oh, hi chandler. it's phoebe. uhm... i know that monica is working today so... ...i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel.

CHANDLER:
 oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, i'm stuck at the office all day.

PHOEBE:
  oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "liar, liar" or "betrayal", or... "an affair to remember".

CHANDLER:
 those are all really old!

PHOEBE:
 ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...

RACHEL:
  "dude, where's my car?" 

PHOEBE:
  what?

RACHEL:
 they're in a caaar...

PHOEBE:
  okay, we-we'll talk to you later. okay, bye. 

RACHEL:
 geez!

PHOEBE:
 ok. quick. we gotta find a cab and follow them.

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah, ok. let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.

PHOEBE:
  i got them!   

CHANDLER:
 hi!

MONICA:
 hey! you smell like perfume and cigarettes. 

CHANDLER:
 i was in the car with nancy all day.

MONICA:
 nancy doesn’t smoke!

CHANDLER:
 well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!

MONICA:
 so? what do you think of the house?

CHANDLER:
 it’s perfect. it’s everything we’ve been looking for.

MONICA:
 isn’t it? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 

CHANDLER:
 and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  what were the things you said?

MONICA:
 don’t you love the huge yard?

CHANDLER:
 and the fireplace in the bedroom.

MONICA:
 and nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!

CHANDLER:
 this is bringing out a lovely color in you!

MONICA:
 so? do you think we should get it?

CHANDLER:
 i don’t know. what do you think?

MONICA:
 i think we should.

CHANDLER:
 i do too.

MONICA:
 this is huge!

CHANDLER:
 i know.

MONICA:
 how bad you wanna smoke, right now.

CHANDLER:
 i don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day.

MONICA:
 gotcha. when do we tell them about this?

CHANDLER:
 we don’t. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing.

MONICA:
 okay. right. oh my god that is gonna be so hard.

CHANDLER:
 i know. gooooood luck with it.   

ROSS:
 i just can’t see chandler cheating!

RACHEL:
 i’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!

JOEY:
 chandler? forty-five minutes? well, something is not right. i just can’t believe he would do this to monica!

ROSS:
 i know, and with the baby coming?

PHOEBE:
 so, should we tell her?

ROSS:
 i don’t know. phoebe, if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?

PHOEBE:
 why? who’d you seen him with?

ROSS:
 no one, i’m just saying if... 

PHOEBE:
 tell me what you know!

ROSS:
  i know nothing! mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!

PHOEBE:
 all right. . he is a good guy. you’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.

ROSS:
 believe me, if i did see with someone, there’s no way i... 

PHOEBE :
 who did you see him with?   

RACHEL:
 oh, look at her, so happy!

MONICA:
 if only there were a smaller one to clean this one!

JOEY:
 hey, is uhm... is chandler here?

MONICA:
 no, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?

PHOEBE:
 well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.

MONICA :
 all right...

ROSS:
 we think chandler might be having an affair.

MONICA:
 what?

RACHEL:
 phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester.

PHOEBE:
 they went in together. so sorry.

MONICA:
 oh my god! oh my god that’s awful! what did you think of the house? 

PHOEBE:
 what?

JOEY:
  monica, you understand what we are saying, right?

MONICA:
 yeah, sure... uhm, i'm devastated, obviously... 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
  you son of a bitch!

CHANDLER:
 is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?

MONICA:
  phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.

RACHEL:
 who's nancy?

ROSS:
 what's going on?

MONICA:
  ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.

CHANDLER:
 yeah  i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.

JOEY:
 i knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!

PHOEBE:
 why do you have a realtor?

MONICA:
 uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.

JOEY:
  what?

RACHEL:
 are you serious?

MONICA:
 when we found out that we're gonna get this baby, chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.

PHOEBE:
 so you're gonna move?

ROSS:
 oh my god.

JOEY:
 shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!

RACHEL:
 what is wrong with raising a kid in the city? i'm doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker is doing it!

MONICA:
 and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...

CHANDLER:
 ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.

ROSS:
  so you wanna buy a house in the 50's?

PHOEBE:
 have you thought about what you would be giving up? you can't move out of the city, what if you want chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door?

ROSS:
 you know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.

JOEY:
 no, no, it's not, don't listen to him! 

ROSS:
 , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be. 

CHANDLER:
 actually, we already found a house we love.

ROSS:
 what?

MONICA:
 and about an hour ago, we made an offer. 

CHANDLER:
 bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh? time lapse

ROSS:
 you put an offer on a house? 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers?

CHANDLER:
 i know this is really hard and we're really sorry.

JOEY:
 is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food?  i really, really think i can! 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 we think if you saw it, you'd understand. i mean you guys were there.  it is beautiful, isn't it?

RACHEL:
 yeah it is.

JOEY:
 what the hell are you doin'?

RACHEL:
 well, it is, all right? when we were out there today, all i kept thinking was: i can't believe chandler is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice place to live!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but so is this.

ROSS:
 yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. i mean, how can you leave this place?    

RACHEL:
  c'mon daddy, listen to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i don't want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying that i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy!

ROSS:
 you can see where he'd have trouble.

RACHEL:
 well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. 

MONICA:
 well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica...   

ROSS:
 that money is mine, green!

RACHEL:
 you're fly is open, geller!

PHOEBE:
 you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?

CHANDLER:
 hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'c'!   

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 ow, that had to hurt!   

PHOEBE:
 hey, it’s your thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.

THE GUYS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
  i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this!

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 i'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. i'm sorry, but iit-t's true, i love him too. 

ROSS:
     

MONICA:
 well, this is the last box of your clothes. i’m just gonna label it, "what were you thinking?"

RACHEL:
 funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler.

PHOEBE:
 ok, you guys, i don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, i don’t want to live with rachel anymore.

MONICA AND RACHEL:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 you’re just so mean to each other! and i don’t want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!

RACHEL:
 well, phoebe that’s fine because i’m not moving.

MONICA:
 whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! y’know, i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i’d like.

PHOEBE:
 what else?

MONICA:
 when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.

PHOEBE:
 that’s nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.

MONICA:
 when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.

RACHEL:
 well y’know, i don’t want you to be cold.

MONICA:
 and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive.  time lapse 

CHANDLER:
  hey.

MONICA:
 she really left.

CHANDLER:
 i know. 

MONICA:
 thank you.

CHANDLER:
 no problem roomie. 

MONICA:
 can i ask you a question?

CHANDLER:
 sure!

MONICA:
 what the hell is that dog doing here?!    

CHANDLER:
 little toast here. i know this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.

ALL:
 that's so sweet.

ROSS:
 and hey, here's to a lousy christmas.

RACHEL:
 and a crappy new year.

CHANDLER:
 here, here!   

RACHEL:
 you can't move. you just... you just can't.

JOEY:
 rachel's right. this is where you guys belong. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you don't wanna live in westchester. that's like the worst of the chesters.

ROSS:
 you know, sometimes when i'm alone in my apartment, i look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching tv or something, but... it makes me feel better. and now when i look over, who am i gonna see? the gottliebs, the yangs? they don't make me feel so good. 

RACHEL:
 yeah. so don't move, okay? just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night. 

CHANDLER:
 hello? it's nancy, they responded to our offer.

MONICA:
 and? 

CHANDLER:
  they passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.

MONICA:
 we can't afford that.

CHANDLER:
 i know.

MONICA:
 well, there you go. 

JOEY:
 i'm really sorry you guys.

ROSS:
 yeah. i'm sorry too. i'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before i told you about looking through the window.

RACHEL:
 yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.

PHOEBE:
  you're gonna be okay?

MONICA:
 yeah, we'll be okay.

ROSS:
 love you guys. 

JOEY:
 you know, i'm really sorry i wasn't more supportive before.

CHANDLER:
 that's okay, we understand.

JOEY:
 and about this nancy thing... if you're not sleeping with her, should i? 

MONICA:
 i know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... i love that one so much.

CHANDLER:
 yeah... well, it's a good thing we got it then.

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 we got the house.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
