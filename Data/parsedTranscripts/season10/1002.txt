JOEY:
 okay, ross, i realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. let me explain, okay?

RACHEL:
 we weren't doing anything!

JOEY:
 rach, he just saw us.

RACHEL:
 shhh.

JOEY:
 but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss.

RACHEL:
 no, come on, that is a lie. we also kissed in barbados. joey  okay, we also kissed in  barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie.

RACHEL:
 yeah, you started it! i've got to chill.

JOEY:
 look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..

RACHEL:
 we feel so terrible about this, ross.

JOEY:
 yeah, but it did happen, so... 

JOEY:
 ross?

RACHEL:
 ross?  can we just close the door?  opening credits    

RACHEL:
 ross, say something. anything.

ROSS:
 so you two are..?

JOEY AND RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 and have you .. ed?

JOEY:
 no, no, no!

RACHEL:
 no, no, no!

ROSS:
 but if i hadn't walked in here, would you..?

JOEY:
 probably. 

JOEY:
 no, no!

RACHEL:
 ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  you have every right to go nuts.

ROSS:
 i'm not going nuts. do you see me go nuts?

RACHEL:
 no, but you know what i mean.

ROSS:
 hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then i'm happy for you.   i'm fine!

JOEY:
 really?

ROSS:
 absolutely.  i'm fine! totally fine. i don't know  why   it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,   i'm fine.   i'm not saying i wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. i mean, at first i was like..  but now that i've had time to absorb it; lovin' this.

JOEY:
 ross..

ROSS:
 it's all working out! me & charlie, and you two. you know what   we should do?

RACHEL:
 calm ourselves?

ROSS:
 no. we should all have dinner. yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.   i'll cook!!

JOEY:
 look, don't you think that will be a little weird?

ROSS:
 weird? what? what's weird? the only thing weird would be if   someone didn't like mexican food, because i'm making fajitas!! (storms   off.)

JOEY:
 i do like fajitas.     

MONICA:
 god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's   inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways   to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.

CHANDLER:
 there's a hair in my coffee. 

PHOEBE:
 hey guys!

MONICA:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with   the triplets.

CHANDLER:
 you know, it's funny. every time you say "triplets," i   immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds. 

MONICA:
 that's sweet. drink your hair.

PHOEBE:
 hey, what's all this stuff?

MONICA:
 oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute, get this one!

MONICA:
 that's not really how it works.

PHOEBE:
 oh, how does it work?

MONICA:
 i don't know!

PHOEBE:
 well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my   friends, bill and colleen. they adopted a kid. i'm sure they'd help   you.

MONICA:
 thanks, that would be great. hey, honey, wouldn't that be   great? (chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 tow   joey's porsche. it's the hair in his coffee.) 

FRANK JR.:
 alright, alright, alright. remember what we talked about.   when we're in a public place, there are certain rules. 

FRANK JR.:
 that's not what we talked about!!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

FRANK JR.:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 good to see you.

FRANK JR.:
 good to see you, too.

MONICA:
 hi frank.

FRANK JR.:
 hi, how you doin'?

MONICA:
 oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big! (little chandler is pulling chandler's sweater, while leslie is   throwing bagels at him.)

MONICA:
 which one is which again?

FRANK JR.:
 oh, that's frank jr. jr. pulling the tampons out of the   lady's purse. and that's chandler climbing on chandler, and that's   leslie throwing bagels at him.

MONICA :
 "willing to adopt triplets?" no!     

JOEY:
 ah, can i just say i know we're doing this for ross, and that's   cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our   first date.

RACHEL:
 well, what would we be doing?

JOEY:
 i'd take you out for a romantic night. some champagne, fancy   dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...

RACHEL:
 feel me up?

JOEY:
 in a carriage! 

JOEY:
 hey, charlie!

RACHEL:
 hey.

CHARLIE:
 hi, hi. so.. dreading this?

RACHEL:
 oh, you bet. 

JOEY:
 so, did you bring a little something for ross?

CHARLIE:
 actually.. it's stuff you left at my apartment.

JOEY:
 oh. oh, thanks.

CHARLIE:
 and you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you   want.

JOEY:
 yeah, i didn't throw any of that out.. 

ROSS:
 i thought i heard voices! hi charlie!  hi joey.    and.. oh! you're gonna have to introduce me to your new   girlfriend.  i'm just kidding, i know rachel, i know. (he   squeezes her hand.) come, please come in. come in.

RACHEL:
 okay, well, we brought you some wine.

ROSS:
 oh! that is so thoughtful.  she's a keeper. and what   did you bring me? 

JOEY:
 uh, actually, that's..

ROSS:
 underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd. i can use all these   things!!

CHARLIE:
 gosh, ross, you know, you seem a little...

ROSS:
 what? fine? because i am! aren't you? aren't you? aren't you?   you see? who else is fine?

JOEY:
 okay, listen, hey, ross. why don't you try to relax, okay? maybe   have a drink.

ROSS:
 you know what? that is a very good idea. i'm gonna go make a   pitcher of margaritas.      

PHOEBE:
 oh, god. so adorable. look at them sleeping there like angels.

FRANK JR.:
 yeah, i really cherish these moments, 'cause before you   know it, they're gonna be awake again.

PHOEBE:
 well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.

FRANK JR.:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 oh, god, the last time i babysat them, they did the funniest   thing..

FRANK JR.:
 i haven't slept in four years!

PHOEBE:
 that's a, that's a long time.

FRANK JR.:
 you just don't know how hard it is, phoebe. there's just so   many of them. you know, two i can handle. two's great. you just hold   one in each hand, but what do i do when the third one runs at me with   his bike helmet on. i've got no more hands to protect my area! there's   three of them, phoebe, three!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i know, frank. i counted them when they were coming out   of my area.

FRANK JR.:
 sometimes i think that.. oh, no, no, no, i can't say it,   it's too horrible. no.

PHOEBE:
 what?

FRANK JR.:
 no, i can't.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, frank, are you thinking of leaving? because i   didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!

FRANK JR.:
 oh, no! i would never do that. no. i just was thinking   that, you know, maybe you could take one.

PHOEBE:
 what?! you can't separate them! that's terrible. which one?    

MONICA:
 thank you so much for seeing us. phoebe has told us such great   things about you guys.

COLLEEN:
 oh, please, we're happy to help.

BILL:
 we went through the same thing when we were adopting.

CHANDLER:
 so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this   room, huh? 

CHANDLER:
 i mean, you have a lovely home.

MONICA:
 well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.

COLLEEN:
 well, actually, i think this might help. 

COLLEEN:
 it's pretty much all the information you need.

MONICA:
 oh my god!

COLLEEN:
 everything is broken down into categories, and then   cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms   in the back.

MONICA:
 thank you.  i think i just had a tiny orgasm.

BILL:
 i know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.   adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.

CHANDLER:
 that's great.  can i see the book? 

CHANDLER:
 you want me to wash my hands first, don't you?

MONICA:
 it's.. it's just so pretty and white.

COLLEEN:
 the bathroom is down the hall, to your left. 

COLLEEN:
 i would have told him to do it too.

MONICA:
 can i adopt you? (cut to the hall. owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking   through a box when chandler walks up to him.)

CHANDLER:
 hey, you must be owen.

OWEN:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too.

OWEN:
 you were?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.

OWEN:
 huh?

CHANDLER:
 you know how to use a compass?

OWEN:
 i have a badge in it.

CHANDLER:
 you do? that's fantastic!

OWEN:
 you wanna see it?

CHANDLER:
 i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your   parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you.

OWEN:
 what?!?

CHANDLER:
 what?

OWEN:
 i'm adopted? 

CHANDLER:
 i got nothing.     

ROSS:
 the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second   batch is gooooood.

RACHEL:
 well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.

ROSS:
 oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? you know? just the four of us.   just hangin'.

JOEY:
 dude, are you okay? and when are the fajitas gonna be ready?

ROSS:
 i'm fine! hey, i'm great! i'm just.. i'm just proud of us.   there's no weirdness, no tension.

RACHEL:
 no awareness.

ROSS:
 we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together. ooh!   let's take a trip. okay, where do you think we - we can go? 

ROSS:
 my fajitas!! 

RACHEL:
 look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a   little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he   normally doesn't drink like this.

CHARLIE:
 oh, you know what? this is nothing. my father is a raging   alcoholic. 

CHARLIE:
 oh, i'm sorry, have i made this evening uncomfortable? (ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven   mitts.)

ROSS:
 fajitas! be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!

RACHEL:
 ross, you don't even have oven mitts on! 

ROSS:
 that is gonna hurt tomorrow!     

PHOEBE:
 okay, well, this is crazy. can't seriously be talking about me   taking one of your kids, can we?

FRANK JR.:
 no, of course we're not.

PHOEBE:
 insane.

FRANK JR.:
 i know.

PHOEBE:
 alice would never go for it, right?

FRANK JR.:
 oh, i don't know, she's pretty tired, too, i think we've   got her onboard.

PHOEBE:
 well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,   hypothetically. which one would you be willing to give up?

FRANK JR.:
 huh.

PHOEBE:
 frank jr.jr.?

FRANK JR.:
 oh, you'd be getting a really good one. i mean, you know,   he's really funny. like, the other day he made up this joke.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh.

FRANK JR.:
 what's green and says "hey, i'm a frog"? a talking frog!    oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.

PHOEBE:
 well, alright, that's fine. what about leslie?

FRANK JR.:
 oh, no, no. not leslie. no, she's, she's the only one that   knows how to burp the alphabet.

PHOEBE:
 alright, so that leaves chandler.

FRANK JR.:
 oh, no, no, you can't have chandler, no. no, no. she's my   little genius. i got big hopes for her. she's gonna be a doctor or a   realtor..

PHOEBE:
 wow, frank. i think we just ran out of kids.

FRANK JR.:
 oh, i think you're right. oh, wow. phoebe, i don't think i   can give one of them up. i mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but   they're my babies.

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, frank. i didn't realise things were so bad. you   know, i'll help out more. i can - i can babysit any time you want. you   name the day, and i'll be there.

FRANK JR.:
 how about tomorrow?

PHOEBE:
 well, that's not good. but you know, i can move some stuff   around, and i'll be there. you and alice just take the whole day   together.

FRANK JR.:
 you'd do that for us?

PHOEBE:
 are you kidding? that's what sisters are for.

FRANK JR. :
 look at them! aw. i love you so   much.  oh crap, don't   wake up, don't wake up!     

CHANDLER:
 where are bill and colleen?

MONICA:
 they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you   believe how nice they are?

CHANDLER:
 we have to leave!!

MONICA:
 why? what did you do in the bathroom?

CHANDLER:
 i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way,   and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may   have told him.

MONICA:
 oh my god, where's my purse? no, you know what? i can replace   everything in there. get that binder, and let's go! 

COLLEEN:
 hey.

BILL:
 some little snacks for everybody. oh, you don't have to eat the   sour worms. those are for owen.

COLLEEN:
 i'll go get him in a second. by the way, you should know we   haven't told him he's adopted yet.

CHANDLER:
 but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he   already knows? 

OWEN:
 i'm adopted?!

CHANDLER:
 see? intuitive!

BILL:
 what? where did you hear that?

OWEN:
 he told me! and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

CHANDLER:
 which technically now you should give back!

COLLEEN:
 you told him he's adopted?

CHANDLER:
 i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or   something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the   door. "owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa   is real."

OWEN:
 he isn't?!

CHANDLER :
 we have to get out of here, baby!     

ROSS:
 everyone? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.

RACHEL:
 ooy.

ROSS:
 and to love. ah, love. l-o-v-e, love. l is for life. and what is   life without love?

RACHEL:
 oh my god, are we supposed to answer?

ROSS:
 o is for "oh, wow!" the v is for this very surprising turn   of   events, which i'm still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely   normal i find it. that you two are together. and now one day you might   get married and have children of your own. 

JOEY:
 dude, are you okay?

ROSS:
 totally.

RACHEL:
 ross, you don't seem okay.

ROSS :
 i'm sorry, it must be the pressure of   entertaining. i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.

CHARLIE:
 wait, ross. ross. i - i have to take off.

ROSS:
 no!

CHARLIE:
 i'm sorry, i have a really early class in the morning, but   this has been lovely.

ROSS:
 wasn't it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and   that you never really liked rachel.

CHARLIE:
 you're on fire! i'll call you in the morning, okay?

ROSS:
 okay.

CHARLIE:
 alright. 

CHARLIE:
 god, rachel, what ross just said that is just so..

RACHEL:
 oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.

CHARLIE:
 bye. 

ROSS:
 okay, i guess it's just flan for three! hey, hey, that rhymed!

RACHEL:
 you know what, ross? i think we're gonna take off too.

ROSS:
 oh, oh. of course. god, i'm so stupid. you guys are a couple   now. i mean, you probably just want to be alone.

RACHEL:
 no, no, it's just that it's getting late...

ROSS:
 hey, hey, it's fine. it's totally fine. we've got plenty of   margaritas. it's all good. 

ROSS:
 i don't even know what that's for. 

JOEY:
 you know what? i think i'm gonna stay here and make sure he's   okay.

RACHEL:
 yeah, that's probably a good idea.

JOEY:
 yeah. i'll see you in the morning.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh. okay. you know what, joey, i don't think he's ever   gonna be okay with this.

JOEY:
 it doesn't look good, does it?      

JOEY:
 morning. here you go.

ROSS:
 thanks. did you stay here all night?

JOEY:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 so you took off my pants and shoes?

JOEY:
 no, no, no. you actually did that when you were dancing to the   chicago-soundtrack. look, ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you   don't have to worry about that, okay? because nothing is gonna happen.

ROSS:
 what do you mean?

JOEY:
 well, she and i said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do   anything unless you were okay with it. and clearly..

ROSS:
 hey, what are you talking about? i'm fine!

JOEY:
 it's okay, ross, alright? i totally understand. of course you're   not fine. you're.. you're ross and rachel.

ROSS:
 except we're not. i mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six   years. oh my god, is that right? has it been that long?

JOEY:
 that's what i hear, yeah.

ROSS:
 this is crazy. i mean, six years? and because of me you guys   aren't gonna be together? can i ask you something? really, what is   this thing with you and rachel?

JOEY:
 come on, i mean, you know me, you know...

ROSS:
 joey.

JOEY:
 i'm crazy about her.

ROSS:
 and she feels the same way?

JOEY:
 i think so.

ROSS:
 well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.

JOEY:
 yeah, but, ross, i mean, you're not okay with it.

ROSS:
 no, but i wanna be. hey, i will be. besides, i'm with charlie,   right? oh my god, i'm still with charlie, aren't i? i mean, she didn't   see the dance, did she?

JOEY:
 no, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. are you sure   about this?

ROSS:
 yeah, i'm sure.

JOEY:
 and we're okay? (ross smiles and holds up his hand for a high-five, but he has   forgotten about his burnt hands. he gasps in pain as joey grabs his   hand.)  ending credits     

MONICA:
 hey, phoebs

PHOEBE:
 hey.

MONICA:
 uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate   us.

CHANDLER:
 owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 still, he had to find out sometime.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets   that you gave birth to them?
