JENNIFER ANISTON :
 previously on friends.

MONICA:
 erica, are you okay?

ERICA:
 yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these    stomach-aches. they come and go like every few minutes.

MONICA:
 oh my god!

CHANDLER:
 relax! we'll just get her some antacids.

MONICA:
 she doesn't have a stomach-ache. she's in labor!

CHANDLER:
 oh my god!    

RACHEL:
 so if you think i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't    mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you    mean more to me.

ROSS:
 rach!

RACHEL:
 what?! (he walks over and kisses her. they pull back, rachel looks at him,  and they kiss again.)    

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 shh.. go back to sleep. i have to go home.

ROSS:
 oh. this was amazing.

RACHEL:
 it really was. you've learned some new moves!

ROSS:
 yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "sex for dummies" as a    joke.

RACHEL:
 ah.

ROSS:
 who's laughing now?

RACHEL:
 i know!    opening credits  

MONICA:
 breathe, breathe, breathe... good.

CHANDLER:
 next time, can i say breathe?

MONICA:
 no, last time you said it like dracula, and it scared her! can    i get you anything? you want some more ice chips?

ERICA:
 no, i'm okay.

MONICA:
 alright, i'll be right back.

CHANDLER:
 where are you going?

MONICA:
 to use the bathroom.

CHANDLER:
 you can't leave me alone with her.

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not    comfortable with!

MONICA:
 what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?

CHANDLER:
 it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone    together.

MONICA:
 you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two    minutes.

CHANDLER:
 okay. (monica leaves, and chandler closes the door. erica just looks at    him.)

CHANDLER:
 so, ah... any plans for the summer?

ERICA:
 i don't know. maybe church-camp?

CHANDLER:
 hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which    is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?

ERICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will    ever know, because no one can experience both. 

CHANDLER:
 one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who    knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things?  like this.    

PHOEBE:
 morning.

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 what's that?

JOEY:
 it's my house-warming present for monica and chandler.

PHOEBE:
 it's a baby chick and duck!

JOEY:
 uh-huh. and i named them chick jr. and duck jr.

PHOEBE:
 i did not see that coming.

JOEY:
 yeah, i figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? it    has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to    that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to.

PHOEBE:
 yes.

JOEY:
 yeah. it's a shame people can't visit there.

PHOEBE:
 that is the rule, though. 

PHOEBE:
 guess what? you're almost an uncle!

ROSS:
 what?

JOEY:
 yeah, erica went into labor last night. monica and chandler are    at the hospital right now!

ROSS:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and i have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.

ROSS:
 phoebe, you were sure ben was gonna be a girl.

PHOEBE:
 have you seen him throw a ball?

ROSS:
 is rachel here?

JOEY:
 uh, i think she's still asleep. hey, hey, how did it go with you    guys last night? she seemed pretty pissed at you.

ROSS:
 uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.

PHOEBE:
 what's that smile? did something happen with you two?

ROSS:
 hey, i'm not one to kiss and tell, but i'm also not one to have    sex and shut up. we totally did it!

JOEY:
 oh my god. you and rachel?

ROSS:
 i know, it's pretty great.

JOEY:
 so what does that mean? are you guys getting back together?

ROSS:
 oh, i.. i don't know. we didn't really get to talk.

PHOEBE:
 but do you wanna get back together?

ROSS:
 i don't know. it was incredible. i mean, it just felt so right.    when i was holding her, i mean, i never wanted to let her go. you know    what? yeah, i do. i wanna be together.

PHOEBE:
  yay!

ROSS:
 shhh!

PHOEBE:
  yay!

JOEY:
 so, so is she still going to paris?

ROSS:
 wow, i hadn't thought of that. i hope not.

PHOEBE:
 oh, this is like the best day ever. ever! you guys might get    back together, monica and chandler are getting their baby, there are    chicks and ducks in the world again! oh, i feel like i'm in a musical!     "daa - raa... when the sun comes up, bright and beaming! and    the moon comes..." 

RACHEL:
 morning!

PHOEBE:
 guess we'll never know how it ends.

JOEY:
 okay.

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey. how did you sleep?

RACHEL:
 good. you?

ROSS:
 good.

JOEY:
 i bet you did!

ROSS:
 uh. would you guys mind giving us a minute?

JOEY:
 sure, yeah. will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?

RACHEL:
 chick and the duck? didn't they die...

PHOEBE:
  dive. yeah, they dove head-first into fun on    the farm. 

ROSS:
 so... 

ROSS:
 morning.

RACHEL:
 you too. last night was just wonderful.

ROSS:
 it really was.

RACHEL:
 i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.

ROSS:
 i know, me too. it was... you know, it was like one of those    things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's    everything you want it to be.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh. i know. it was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.     

MONICA:
 it's just a little bit more, honey.

ERICA:
 help me! this hurts!

CHANDLER:
 is it really that bad?

ERICA:
 uh-huh! i think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which    is worse! 

DOCTOR:
 the baby's head is crowning. 

MONICA:
 oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have    ever seen! chandler, you have to see this! 

CHANDLER:
 i'm okay.

MONICA:
 chandler, you don't wanna miss this. this is the birth of your    child! it's the miracle of life!

CHANDLER:
 alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle.

DOCTOR:
 start pushing. here we go. here come the shoulders... 

MONICA:
 it's a... it's a boy!

CHANDLER:
 wow!

ERICA:
 is he okay?

DOCTOR:
 he's just fine.

MONICA:
 oh, you did it!

CHANDLER:
  it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some   other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see.

DOCTOR:
 would you like to cut the umbilical cord? (a nurse gives monica a pair of scissors. monica gives it to chandler,    and they cut it together.)

CHANDLER:
 well, that's spongy.

MONICA:
  oh, hey handsome! oh, i'm gonna love you so much   that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (to chandler, on   the verge of tears) oh, we are so lucky!

CHANDLER:
 i know. he has your eyes. 

CHANDLER:
 i mean, i know that's not possible, but he does.

NURSE:
 we'll just get him cleaned up a bit. (the doctor hands the boy to the nurse, and she walks over to another    part of the room with him.)

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
  oh my god, he's beautiful. thank you so much.

ERICA:
 i'm really happy for you guys.

CHANDLER:
 how do you feel?

ERICA:
 i'm tired!

DOCTOR:
 well, you don't have that much time to relax. the other one    will be along in a minute. (chandler stares at the doctor, completely shocked. monica just    freezes and turns around slowly.)

MONICA:
 i... i'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?

DOCTOR:
 the next baby should be along in a minute.

MONICA:
 we only ordered one!

DOCTOR:
 you know it's twins, right?

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know! commercial break 

DOCTOR:
 i can't believe you didn't know it's twins! this has never    happened before.

CHANDLER:
 well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good.

MONICA:
  wait, did you know it was twins?

DOCTOR:
 yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in    ohio.

MONICA:
  anybody tell you?

ERICA:
 i don't think so. although, they did mention something about    two heartbeats. but i thought that was just mine and the baby's. they    kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and i thought well,    that's good 'cause i'm having a baby.

MONICA:
 this is unbelievable.

ERICA:
 twins actually run in my family.

CHANDLER:
 interesting!  can i see you for a second? 

CHANDLER:
 what do we do?

MONICA:
 what do you mean "what do we do"?

CHANDLER:
  twins! twins!!

MONICA:
 chandler, you're panicking!

CHANDLER:
 uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep   one, and then just like have an option on the other one?

MONICA:
 we can't split them up!

CHANDLER:
 why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and    then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. i mean,    that's a great day for everybody.

MONICA:
 okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?

CHANDLER:
 what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king?

MONICA:
 yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt.

CHANDLER:
 monica, we are not ready to have two babies!

MONICA:
 that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't    care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies! i don't    care if the entire cast of "eight is enough" comes out of there! we    are taking them home, because they are our children!

CHANDLER:
  okay. shhh... 

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 okay!

CHANDLER:
 okay!

DOCTOR:
 it looks like we're about ready over here. 

DOCTOR:
 come on, erica, start pushing again now.

ERICA:
 ow! 

DOCTOR:
 here she comes!

CHANDLER:
  she? it's a girl?

DOCTOR:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
     and that's enough!   

ROSS:
 and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.

JOEY:
 oh my god! what did you say?

ROSS:
 nothing! what do you say to that?

PHOEBE:
 ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!

ROSS:
 no way!

JOEY:
 you can't just give up! is that what a dinosaur would do?

ROSS:
 what?

JOEY:
 dude, i'm just trying to speak your language.

PHOEBE:
 ross, rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. if    she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go.

ROSS:
 you really think so?

PHOEBE:
 i'm telling you! oh, okay! this is the part of the musical    where there'd be a really good convincing song.  "bam-bam,    don't take no for an answer. bam-bam, don't let love fly away.    bam-bam-bam-bam..." 

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 can't a girl finish a song around here?

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi! so i just dropped emma off at my mom's.

ROSS:
 okay.

JOEY:
 oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?

RACHEL:
 no, we decided that i would go ahead and set up first, and    then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday.

PHOEBE:
 wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? good luck, mom.

RACHEL:
 are you kidding? eight hours with my mother talking about    atkins? good luck, emma! 

ROSS:
 alright, you know what? you're right. i should at least tell her   how i feel. 

JOEY:
 ross, wait!

ROSS:
 what? what?

JOEY:
 could you get me a muffin? 

GUNTHER:
 rachel?

RACHEL:
 yeah?

GUNTHER:
 i... i know you're leaving tonight, but i just have to tell   you. i love you. 

GUNTHER:
 i... i don't know if that changes your plans at all, but i   thought you should know.

RACHEL:
  gunther... oh... i love you too. probably not in the   same way, but i do. and, and when i'm in a café, having coffee, or i   see a man with hair brighter than the sun, i'll think of you. aw. 

RACHEL:
 oh... bye guys. 

ROSS:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 unbelievable!

JOEY:
 hey, you know what might help?

ROSS:
 i'm not getting you a muffin!    

MONICA:
 do you think they recognize each other from in there?

CHANDLER:
 maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in    apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're    pushed through a vagina and they meet.

NURSE:
 we're going to take erica to recovery now.

MONICA:
 there's something that we wanna tell you. we decided to name    the girl-baby erica.

ERICA:
 oh my god, that's just like my name!

MONICA:
 son of a gun, it is!

ERICA:
 anyway, i'm gonna go and get some rest. i'm really glad i    picked you guys. you're gonna make great parents. even chandler.

MONICA:
 okay, well, bye!

ERICA:
 bye!

CHANDLER:
 bye!

MONICA:
 we'll call you!

ERICA:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 have fun at church-camp! (the nurses take erica to the recovery room. monica and chandler smile   at each other.)

MONICA:
 oh, look at these little bunnies!

CHANDLER:
 i know! you ready to trade?

MONICA:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 alright, let's see.. (they start trying to trade babies while holding one each. they have    no idea how to do it, so they just shift the babies around in their    arms. they give up pretty quickly.)

CHANDLER:
 we could trade later.

MONICA:
 yeah, i'm good.      there is a white crib decorated with balloons in the middle of the    apartment. also, there are boxes all over the apartment. joey is  

PHOEBE:
 hey, what are you working on?

JOEY:
 it's a... it's a "welcome home" sign for the baby. (he holds up a white poster with huge red letters. it reads, "welcome   home baby." there is also a huge red stain on the left of the poster.)

PHOEBE:
 how sweet! oh, is that the baby? 

JOEY:
 no, i sat in the paint. 

ROSS:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey. so, did you talk to rachel?

ROSS:
 no, and i'm not going to.

PHOEBE:
 what?

JOEY:
 why not?

ROSS:
 because she's just going to shoot me down. you guys saw what    happened with gunther. that did not look like fun.

PHOEBE:
 how can you compare yourself to gunther? i mean, sure, he's    sexy in a more obvious way. you have a relationship with her, you    slept together last night.

ROSS:
 yeah, and she still wants to go! it's pretty clear where she is.

JOEY:
 yeah, i know what you mean. i mean, sometimes... 

PHOEBE:
 uh, joe?

JOEY:
 damn it!

ROSS:
 look, even if i were gonna tell her, i don't have to do it now.    okay? i'll be seeing her again. we've got time.

PHOEBE:
 no, you don't! she's going to paris! she is going to meet    somebody. do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it's...    it's a city of gunthers! 

MIKE:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey! what do you have there?

MIKE:
 oh, i made a little something. if i had more time to work on it,    it'd be better, but.. (he shows them a beautiful banner he has made. it reads, "welcome to    the world, baby bing.")

ROSS:
 oh my god! you did that yourself?

PHOEBE:
 honey, that's gorgeous!

JOEY:
 you know, the baby can't read, mike! 

RACHEL:
 hi! you guys, the car-service just got here. i can't believe   they're not home yet! i have to catch my stupid plane. i wanna see the   baby!

JOEY:
 monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here   any minute. and apparently, there's some big surprise.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'cause my friend ethel's   baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god!

ROSS:
 oh my god! 

RACHEL:
 hi! oh my gosh! 

CHANDLER:
 hey. 

PHOEBE, ROSS, RACHEL:
 hey. (they turn back around to see the baby monica's carrying, but then    they realise what the surprise is. ross, mike, phoebe and rachel gasp    and stare at chandler and his baby. joey hasn't figured it out yet.)

JOEY:
  hey, so what is the big surprise?

RACHEL:
 oh. (joey stares at chandler and monica and finally puts two and two    together. he gasps.)

ROSS:
 oh my god!

RACHEL:
 what... what...

ROSS:
 okay, okay, awkward question. the hospital knows you took two,    right?

MONICA:
 yes, it's twins!

ROSS:
 oh my god.

JOEY:
 oh, they're so cute! now, what, what kinds are they?

MONICA:
  this is a boy, (points at    the baby chandler is holding) and that's a girl.

CHANDLER:
 her name is erica.

RACHEL:
 aw..

JOEY:
 hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica.

CHANDLER:
 yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time   together.

MONICA:
 yeah, we named the boy jack after dad.

ROSS:
 aw, he's gonna be so happy.

PHOEBE:
 oh, jack bing. i love that. ooh, it sounds like a '40s   newspaper guy, you know? "jack bing, morning gazette. i'm gonna blow   this story wide open!" (chandler and monica carry erica and jack over to the crib and put   them down carefully.)

RACHEL:
 oh my gosh. wow, so beautiful.

MIKE:
  i want one.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah? well, tell me which one, and i'll try slip it in my   coat.

MIKE:
 seriously. wanna make one of those?

PHOEBE:
 one? how about a whole bunch?

MIKE:
 really?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the   von trapp family! only without the nazis. although that sounds kinda   dull.

RACHEL:
 oh, you guys, i can't believe this. but i'll leave now, or i'm   gonna miss my plane.

MONICA:
 i'm just so glad you got to see the babies. 

RACHEL:
 me too. oh, i'm just sorry i'm not gonna be around to watch   you two attempt to handle this! alright, i can't say goodbye to you   guys again. i love you all so much.

MONICA:
 i love you.

CHANDLER:
 i love you.

MONICA:
 call us when you get there.

RACHEL:
 i will. ross, come here. 

RACHEL:
 i just want you to know.. last night.. i'll never forget it.

ROSS:
 neither will i. 

RACHEL:
 alright, now i really have to go. okay. au revoir! oh, they're    gonna really hate me over there. 

PHOEBE:
 so, you just let her go?

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 hey, maybe that's for the best.

ROSS:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 yeah. you know? you just... look, you gotta... you gotta think    about last night the way she does, okay? maybe, maybe sleeping    together was the perfect way to say goodbye?

PHOEBE:
 but now she'll never know how he feels!

JOEY:
 maybe that's okay. you know? maybe, maybe it is better this way?    i mean, now, now you can move on. i mean, you've been trying to for so   long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (looks at   phoebe) right? 

JOEY:
 maybe now you can actually do it. you know? you can finally get   over her.

ROSS:
 yeah, that's true. except i don't wanna get over her.

JOEY:
 what?

ROSS:
 i don't! i wanna be with her.

JOEY:
 really?

ROSS:
 yeah, i'm gonna go after her.

JOEY:
 yeah, you are!

PHOEBE:
 woo! 

PHOEBE:
 wait, wait! get your coat! get your coat!

ROSS:
 my coat...

JOEY:
 this is so cool!

CHANDLER:
 i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited!

JOEY:
 but ross, ross. what do you, what do you think she's going to   say?

ROSS:
 i don't know, but i.. look, even if she shoots me down, at least   i won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.   where - where is my coat?!

PHOEBE:
 you didn't bring one! my cab's downstairs, i'll drive you to   the airport.

ROSS:
 okay, guys, wish me luck.

PHOEBE:
 hurry!

JOEY:
 good luck, good luck!     

ROSS:
 there's no seatbelt!

PHOEBE:
 that's okay. if - if we hit anything, the engine will explode,    so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car. 

ROSS:
 alright, alright, let's do this!

PHOEBE:
 okay! 

ROSS:
 hey!

MAN:
 18th and east end.

PHOEBE:
 i - i don't take passengers.

MAN:
 hey! the law says you have to accept any fare.

ROSS:
 no, you don't understand. this isn't a real cab.

MAN:
 alright, i gotta report you. what's your medallion number?

PHOEBE:
 my medallion number is, "get out of the cab!"

MAN:
 what?

ROSS:
  get out of the cab!

PHOEBE:
 get out of the cab!     

JOEY:
 oh, hey, hey, can i give you guys your house-warming present    now?

MONICA:
 now, that you can do.

JOEY:
 alright! (cut to joey's apartment. joey looks inside the cardboard box that   used to be the home of chick jr. and duck jr., but they have   disappeared.)

JOEY:
 ah... chick jr.? duck jr.? don't hide from mama!    

PHOEBE:
 you can open your eyes now.

ROSS:
 are we off the bridge?

PHOEBE:
 yes.

ROSS:
 is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?

PHOEBE:
 yes, she jumped right back up. 

ROSS:
 oh my god, phoebe, slow down!

PHOEBE:
 do you wanna get to rachel in time?

ROSS:
 yes, but i don't wanna die in your cab!

PHOEBE:
 you should have thought of that before you got in! 

PHOEBE:
 toll-booth.

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
  toll-booth! four bucks. there are quarters in the    glove compartment. (ross tries to open a plastic bag filled with quarters, but he's quite   slow.)

PHOEBE:
 hurry!

ROSS:
 okay!

PHOEBE:
 okay. (phoebe tries to throw some quarters out the window, but she has   forgotten to open the window, and she and ross scream.)

PHOEBE:
 damn, that window is clean.   

JOEY:
 quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,   quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack... 

CHANDLER:
 we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but   now we understand you were doing this.

JOEY:
 okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,   i got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck! 

CHANDLER:
 really? you got us a chick and a duck?

MONICA:
 oh, great! just what you want for a new house with infants.   bird feces.

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now   they're gone!

CHANDLER:
 oh, don't worry, we'll find them.

MONICA:
 actually, i'm gonna go check on the twins.

CHANDLER:
 alright. (monica turns around and is about to leave when she steps on   something.)

MONICA:
 oh god! what did i just step on?

JOEY:
 oh!

CHANDLER:
 it's okay, it's just an egg roll.

MONICA:
 oh..

JOEY:
 you stepped on my egg roll?

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, i didn't know to look for chinese food on the    floor.

JOEY:
 just put it on a plate and leave. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, let's find these birds.

JOEY:
 alright. 

JOEY:
 wait, wait. do you hear that? 

JOEY:
 oh! they're in the table!

CHANDLER:
 well, that can't be good!

JOEY:
 we gotta get them out of there!

CHANDLER:
 how?

JOEY:
 oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls?

CHANDLER:
 oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman.

JOEY:
 well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.

CHANDLER:
 joey, wait! the ball!

JOEY:
 oh! (the ball rolls into one of the goals, and chandler and joey listen in    horror as the ball makes its way inside the table. finally, they can    hear the birds again.)

JOEY:
 oh god! so what do we do?

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow.

JOEY:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 no... it's all glued together.

JOEY:
 does that mean we have to bust it open?

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. maybe.

JOEY:
 oh my god!

CHANDLER:
 i know! it's.. it's the foosball table.

JOEY:
 all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would    have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd gotten the part. "those are our    men in there, we have to get them out! even if i have to sacrifice the    most important thing in my life; my time-machine."

CHANDLER:
 did that movie ever get made?

JOEY:
 it did not.   

PHOEBE:
 ross, where are you going?

ROSS:
 to talk to rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the    death-cab?

PHOEBE:
 what? what are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? have    you never chased anyone through the airport before?

ROSS:
 not since my cop-show got cancelled.

PHOEBE:
 you have to get a ticket to get past security.

ROSS:
 what? we're never gonna make it!

PHOEBE:
 not with that attitude! now, haul ass! (they run to the ticket counter, but they get stuck behind a group of    old people who are walking very slowly.)

ROSS:
 okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.      

GATE ATTENDANT #1:
  madame, your passport    please?

RACHEL:
 oh my god! i was so afraid i wasn't gonna remember any of my    high-school french, but i understood every word you just said!

GATE ATTENDANT #1:
 your boarding pass, please.

RACHEL:
 oh. 

RACHEL:
 oh, shoot. i had it. oh, i can't believe this.

GATE ATTENDANT #1:
 madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...

RACHEL:
 i have it, i have it, i have it. oh, okay, i can't find it,    but i remember that i was in seat 32c, because that's my bra-size.

GATE ATTENDANT #1:
 madame, you must have your boarding pass..

RACHEL:
 okay, fine! but you know what? if i was in 36d, we would not  be having this problem.     

ROSS:
 hey, i need a ticket.

PHOEBE:
 just one? i drive you all the way down here, and i don't get    to see how it works out?

ROSS:
 fine, two tickets, i need two tickets.

PHOEBE:
 we're on our honeymoon.

TICKET AGENT:
 and the destination?

ROSS:
 i don't care. whatever is the cheapest.

PHOEBE:
 i'm so lucky i married you.   

RACHEL:
 oh! shoot! damn it! where is it? oh! oh! i found it! i found    it! 

RACHEL:
 hah! i found it! i told you i would find it! in your face!  you're a different person.      

ROSS:
 okay, flight 421 to paris. i don't see it, do you see it?

PHOEBE:
 no, did we miss it?

ROSS:
 no, no, no. that's impossible. it doesn't leave for another 20    minutes.

PHOEBE:
 maybe we have the flight-number wrong. god. 

MONICA:
 hello.

PHOEBE:
 hey, it's me. here's ross.

ROSS:
 what? hey, hey, listen.. 

MONICA:
 oh my god! ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises    the twins are making. listen. 

ROSS:
 monica? monica, monica, monica, monica..?

MONICA:
 oh, i'm sorry. shoot, they were doing it before.

ROSS:
 that's alright. listen, listen.

MONICA:
 oh, wait, wait, wait! here they go again. 

ROSS:
 monica? monica, monica, monica, monica..?

MONICA:
 isn't that cute?

ROSS:
 that is precious! listen! i need rachel's flight information.

MONICA:
 oh, okay. alright, it's flight 421. leaves at 8:40.

ROSS:
 yes, that's what i have. it's not on the board.

MONICA:
 that's what it says here. flight 421, leaves at 8:40, newark    airport.

ROSS:
 what?

MONICA:
 newark airport. why, where are you?

ROSS:
 jfk. (ross sadly hangs up the phone, while phoebe looks at him. cut to rachel at the gate. she gives her boarding pass to the gate    attendant, and she goes onboard. the gate attendant closes the door  and locks it.)     

JOEY:
  don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of    there.

CHANDLER:
 and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids. (joey picks up a hammer and a crowbar and gets ready to destroy the    table.)

JOEY:
 okay. here goes.

CHANDLER:
 what's the matter?

JOEY:
 i need to say goodbye to the table first.

CHANDLER:
 i understand.

JOEY:
 okay. table, you have given us so many great times. and you    guys, jordan, victor, joel... all of you guys. what can i say? you    guys make us look good. you wanna say anything?

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. except that, for one last time... (he touches    the players as he says the following) good game, good game, good game,    good game, good game, good game, good game.

JOEY:
 okay, here we go. i can't do it.

CHANDLER:
 well, i can't do it either. 

MONICA:
 hey! did you find them?

JOEY:
 yeah, they're stuck inside the table!

CHANDLER:
 we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!

MONICA:
 oh, well sure. this gotta be so hard. i'll do it. gimme! (monica grabs the hammer and the crowbar and gets ready to bust it  open.)     

ROSS:
 phoebe! wow! no, no, no! 

PHOEBE:
 well, i've never gone this fast before.

ROSS:
 phoebe, forget it, okay? newark is - is like an hour away.    there's no way we're gonna make it in time.

PHOEBE:
 she's got her cell, you could call her.

ROSS:
 i am not doing this over the phone.

PHOEBE:
 you don't have any other choice! (she lets go of the steering wheel to get her cell-phone from her    purse. ross screams and reaches over in order to hold onto the wheel. cut to the plane. rachel is sitting in her seat when her cell-phone    rings.)

RACHEL:
 hello?

PHOEBE:
 rachel? oh, good. hey, by the way, did you just get on the    plane?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
  for what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.

ROSS:
 yay.

PHOEBE:
 uh, rach, hang on. (phoebe tries to give her phone to ross, but he won't take it. he    mouths "no.")

RACHEL:
 phoebe? is everything okay?

PHOEBE:
 uhm, actually no. no, you've... you have to get off the plane.

RACHEL:
 what? why?

PHOEBE:
 i have this feeling that something's wrong with it. something    is wrong with the left philange.

RACHEL:
 oh, honey, i'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane. (the passenger in the seat next to rachel looks at her and seems a    little nervous.)

RACHEL:
 alright, look, i have to go. i love you, and i will call you    the minute i get to paris. 

PASSENGER #1:
 uhm, what was that?

RACHEL:
 oh, that was just my crazy friend. she told me i should get    off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something    wrong with the left philange.

PASSENGER #1:
 okay, that doesn't sound good.

RACHEL:
 i wouldn't worry about it. she's always coming up with stuff    like this, and you know what? she's almost never right.

PASSENGER #1:
 but she is sometimes.

RACHEL:
 well... (the passenger stands up and gets his suitcase from the overhead    compartment.)

RACHEL:
 wait, what are you doing?

PASSENGER #1:
 well, i can't take this plane now.

AIR STEWARDESS:
 excuse me, sir, where are you going?

PASSENGER #1:
 i have to get off this plane, okay? her friend has a    feeling something's wrong with the left philange.

RACHEL:
 could i get some peanuts?

PASSENGER #2:
 what's wrong with the plane?

AIR STEWARDESS:
 there's nothing wrong with the plane.

PASSENGER #1:
 yeah! the left philange!

AIR STEWARDESS:
 there is no philange!

PASSENGER #1:
 oh my god. this plane doesn't even have a philange!

PASSENGER #2:
 i'm not flying on it!

AIR STEWARDESS:
 ma'am, please sit down!

PASSENGER #3:
 what's going on?

PASSENGER #1:
 we're all getting off. there is no philange! 

RACHEL:
 this is ridiculous! i... 

RACHEL:
 yeah, okay.     

MONICA:
 alright. my job here is done.

CHANDLER:
 that was... impressive.

JOEY:
 yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!

MONICA:
 yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get    back to the babies. i'll see you girls later. 

CHANDLER:
 sorry about the table, man.

JOEY:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 you gonna buy a new one?

JOEY:
 probably not. nah. i don't know how much i'm gonna wanna play    after you go.

CHANDLER:
 well, at least we got these little guys out.

JOEY:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get    used to things crapping in my hand, huh?

JOEY:
 i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds    around again.

CHANDLER:
 hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.

JOEY:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus,    here they'd have their own room.

JOEY:
 i could get a goose!

CHANDLER:
 you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry.

JOEY:
 thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to    stay here! and, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a    reason to come visit.

CHANDLER:
 i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame    cool guy handshake?

JOEY:
 uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah. (they do the lame cool guy handshake. they look at each other, and  then they hug.)      

GATE ATTENDANT #2:
 ma'am, i assure you, the plane is fine.

PASSENGER #2:
 and you fixed the philange?

GATE ATTENDANT #2:
 yes, the philange is fixed. as a matter of fact, we    put a whole lot of extra philanges onboard, just in case. 

ROSS:
 where is she?

PHOEBE:
 i don't see her.

ROSS:
 rachel! rachel green!

PHOEBE:
 there she is!

ROSS:
 rachel! rachel!

GATE ATTENDANT #2:
 wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?

ROSS:
 no, no, i just have to talk to someone.

GATE ATTENDANT #2:
 i'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a    boarding pass.

ROSS:
 no, no, no, but...

PHOEBE:
  rachel!! 

RACHEL:
 oh my god... what.. what are you guys doing here?

PHOEBE:
 okay, you're on.

RACHEL:
 what? what? ross, you're scaring me. what's going on?

ROSS:
 okay, the thing is..

RACHEL:
 yeah?

ROSS:
 don't go.

RACHEL:
 what?

ROSS:
 please, please stay with me. i am so in love with you. please,    don't go.

RACHEL:
 oh my god.

ROSS:
 i know, i know. i shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but    i'm.. that was stupid, okay? i'm sorry, but i'm telling you now. i    love you. do not get on this plane.

GATE ATTENDANT #2:
 miss? are you boarding the plane?

ROSS:
 hey, hey. i know you love me. i know you do.

GATE ATTENDANT #2:
 miss?

RACHEL:
 i - i have to get on the plane.

ROSS:
 no, you don't.

RACHEL:
 yes, i do.

ROSS:
 no, you don't.

RACHEL:
 they're waiting for me, ross. i can't do this right now, i'm    sorry. i'm sorry.

ROSS:
 rachel?

RACHEL:
 i'm so sorry. 

ROSS:
 i really thought she'd stay.

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry.     

MONICA:
 well, that's it. everything's packed.

CHANDLER:
 wow, this is weird.

MONICA:
 i know.

JOEY:
 yeah. uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?

MONICA:
 i put three lasagnas in your freezer.

JOEY:
 i love you! 

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey.

JOEY:
 so did you guys make it in time?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.

CHANDLER:
 where's ross?

PHOEBE:
 he went home. he didn't want to see anybody.   

RACHEL:
  ross, hi. it's me. i just got back    on the plane. and i just feel awful. that is so not how i wanted    things to end with us. it's just that i wasn't expecting to see you,    and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... and... and    now i'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have    said, and i didn't. i mean, i didn't even get to tell you that i love    you too. because of course i do. i love you. i love you. i love you.    what am i doing? i love you! oh, i've gotta see you. i've gotta get    off this plane.

ROSS:
 oh my god!

RACHEL:
  excuse me?

AIR STEWARDESS:
  miss? please, sit down!

RACHEL:
  i'm sorry. i'm really sorry, but i    need to get off the plane, okay? i need to tell someone that i love    love them.

AIR STEWARDESS:
  miss, i can't let you off    the plane.

ROSS:
 let her off the plane!

AIR STEWARDESS:
  i am afraid you are gonna    have to take a seat.

RACHEL:
  oh, please, miss, you don't    understand!

ROSS:
 try to understand!

RACHEL:
  oh, come on, miss, isn't there any    way that you can just let me off... 

ROSS:
 no! no! oh my god. did she get off the plane? did she get off    the plane?

RACHEL:
 i got off the plane.

ROSS:
 you got off the plane. 

RACHEL:
 i do love you.

ROSS:
 i love you too, and i'm never letting you go again.

RACHEL:
 okay. 'cause this is where i wanna be, okay? no more messing    around. i don't wanna mess this up again.

ROSS:
 me neither, okay? we are - we're done being stupid.

RACHEL:
 okay. you and me, alright? this is it.

ROSS:
 this is it. unless we're on a break. 

ROSS:
 don't make jokes now.       holding the twins. joey and phoebe are sitting by the window, while    ross and rachel are standing together. the apartment is completely  

MONICA:
 okay, please be careful with that. it was my grandmother's. be    careful. 

MONICA:
 if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing. 

ROSS:
 wow.

RACHEL:
 i know. it seems smaller somehow.

JOEY:
 has it always been purple?

CHANDLER:
  look around, you guys. this was your first    home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but    more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal! 

PHOEBE:
 hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived    in this apartment?

MONICA:
 oh, yeah, that's true.

ROSS:
 uh, i haven't.

MONICA:
 wait a minute. what about that summer during college that you    lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?

ROSS:
 do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming    up?

MONICA:
 oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our    keys.

CHANDLER:
 oh, okay. (chandler and monica walk over to the kitchen-counter and leave their    keys. then the other four pick out their keys and leave them as well.)

PHOEBE:
 so, i guess this is it.

JOEY:
 yeah. i guess so.

MONICA:
  this is harder than i thought it would be.

CHANDLER:
 oh, it's gonna be okay. (chandler hugs her. monica hugs ross and rachel as chandler gets the stroller with the    twins.)

RACHEL:
  do you guys have to go to the new house right away,    or do you have some time?

MONICA:
 we got some time.

RACHEL:
 okay, should we get some coffee?
