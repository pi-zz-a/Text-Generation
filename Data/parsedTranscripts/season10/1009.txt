CHANDLER:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio.

PHOEBE:
 oh, right! your adoption interview!

MONICA:
 yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.

JOEY:
 i can't believe it. when you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! that is so weird!

CHANDLER:
 and so incorrect!

MONICA:
 she's only a couple of months pregnant. she liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.

ROSS:
 come on, she's gonna love you guys!

CHANDLER:
 uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.

MONICA:
 and a lot could still get in our way.

CHANDLER:
 yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..

PHOEBE:
 what are you gonna name the baby?

CHANDLER:
 i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word.

JOEY:
 but just think, ok? what if everything goes right? what if this woman does pick you guys?

MONICA:
 oh my god. she's gonna pick us!

CHANDLER:
 so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?

MONICA:
 you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna have a baby chandler, a baby!

CHANDLER:
 yes, but...

MONICA:
 oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and 

CHANDLER:
 oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!!  opening credits  

RACHEL:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 oh, that's sarah. no, no. don't you get any ideas, ok? no, i'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!

JOEY:
 ow, why, why, why?

PHOEBE:
 because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!

JOEY:
 oh, name one friend of yours that i did that with.

PHOEBE:
 mandy.

JOEY:
 mandy, uh? uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?

PHOEBE:
 no.

JOEY:
 i know why i don't remember her, huh? 

RACHEL:
 do you think i'm someone else?

JOEY:
 ok, i may not have treated your friends well in the past, but i have grown up a lot, really. honest, rach?

RACHEL:
 well, believe it or not, it's true. when joey and i were together, he was wonderful. he was thoughtful and mature. and for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!

JOEY:
  growth!

PHOEBE:
 fine, i'll give you her number.

JOEY:
 ok, thank you. and i promise you i will not forget this one.  mandy.

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh!

ROSS:
  how does this look?

RACHEL:
 well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  now throw it away!

ROSS:
 c'mon! this looks good!

RACHEL:
 ross, please, trust me. i buy 30 fashion magazines a month. now, i don't know who's running for president or who that... nato guy is, but i do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.

ROSS:
 damnit! i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool!

PHOEBE:
 well, you know, if you want fashion help, rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow. you're more than welcome to come with us, right?

ROSS:
 really? that would be great. i mean, i have to do something, she kinda teased me about how i dress. 

JOEY:
 i can see why, nice shirt!

ROSS:
 you're wearing the same shirt.

JOEY:
 stupid gap on every corner!   

AGENCY GUY:
 please, make yourself comfortable and i will back in a moment with erica.

MONICA:
 ok, thank you. uh, well this is it. are you ok?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. just weird, you know. it's like: "hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?"

MONICA:
 uh, we're gonna be great.

CHANDLER:
 you're gonna be great.

MONICA:
 well... obviously!

AGENCY GUY:
  monica, chandler. i'd like you to meet erica.

MONICA:
 hi. it is so, so nice to meet you.

ERICA:
  hi...

CHANDLER:
 thank you so much for agreeing to see us.

ERICA:
 hi.

AGENCY GUY:
 i'll let you get acquainted.

CHANDLER:
 ok.

ERICA:
 so, it's monica and chandler. i only know you as file 0w33815-d.

CHANDLER:
 that's what our friends call us.

ERICA:
 gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. it's... kind of intimidating.

MONICA:
 i don't know about that.

ERICA:
 you're kidding me? i mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to a reverend?

CHANDLER:
  i don't think that's exactly...

MONICA:
  let her finish, doctor.    

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night.

JOEY:
 well...

PHOEBE:
 yeah! so you're gonna call this one back?

JOEY:
 nope.

PHOEBE:
 what are you talking about? sarah's great!

JOEY:
 oh, really? you know what your great friend did? we're out to dinner, ok?  we're getting along, having a really nice time. i was thinking she was really cool. and then, out of nowhere...  

PHOEBE:
 that’s it? that’s why you won’t go out with her again? so, she took some fries, big deal!

JOEY:
 hey, hey, look! it’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.

PHOEBE:
 what?

JOEY:
 all food!

PHOEBE:
 i’m sorry, i can’t believe i set you up with such a monster!

JOEY:
 hey, hey, hey, hey. look. i take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! the more, the better! all right? just don’t order a garden salad and then eat my food! that’s a good way to lose some fingers! 

PHOEBE:
  oh

RACHEL:
 hi

PHOEBE:
 thank god you’re here. listen to this!

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...

RACHEL:
 oh! oh, no! 

PHOEBE:
 what? you know about the plate thing?

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah. joey doesn’t share food. i mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...

PHOEBE:
  you wouldn’t let her have a grape?

RACHEL:
 oh no! not me! emma! 

JOEY:
  joey doesn’t share food!

PHOEBE:
 well, i still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. you are calling her! and if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!

JOEY:
  what were we talking about?  

PHOEBE:
  this place is awesome!

ROSS:
 you know, we should just go, i’m not gonna find anything here! this stuff is ridiculous!  

RACHEL:
 ah, this place is great!

PHOEBE:
 wow!

ROSS:
 rach, come on, i’m not gonna wear any of this! .

RACHEL:
 ross, look, i know that some of this stuff is out there, but i mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . i mean, this is just beautiful!

ROSS:
 . three hundred and fifty dollars?

RACHEL:
 yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!

ROSS:
 both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.

PHOEBE :
 hey, check this out! it’s totally you!

ROSS:
 wow!

PHOEBE:
 yeah! 

ROSS:
 actually this looks like pretty good! yeah! boys will be boys?

PHOEBE:
 what? they will be!

ROSS:
 all right, that’s it, i’m getting out of here.

RACHEL:
 no, no, no, no! ross, wait! come on! you know, there’s other stuff. here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...

ROSS:
 uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.

RACHEL:
 yes, they will! you know what you should do? just go take a walk, all right? i know your size and i’m... i’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.

ROSS:
 really?

RACHEL:
 yes! and i know what looks sexy on guys. please, just wear what i suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.

ROSS:
 so, you’re saying, uh, if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers?

RACHEL:
  why do men keep talking to me like this?   

CHANDLER:
 so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?

ERICA:
 yeah, i read some great applications, but then i thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”

MONICA:
 amen.

CHANDLER:
 plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!

MONICA:
 uh, good hands.  healing hands.

ERICA:
 reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything about adoption?

MONICA:
 it says “do it!”. and behold she did adopt onto them a baby. and it was good.

ERICA:
 wow.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, wow.

ERICA:
 i was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?

MONICA:
 oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. good flock. flock, flock, flock.

ERICA:
  being a doctor must take up a lot of time.

CHANDLER:
 no-ot for me it doesn’t. 

AGENCY GUY:
 so, how’s everything going in here?

ERICA:
 we’re great, i think i may have asked all my questions.

AGENCY GUY:
 do you have any question for erica?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?

AGENCY GUY:
 yes, our system assures total anonimity. we’re very proud of it.

CHANDLER:
 you should be. you’re really on top of stuff..

AGENCY GUY:
  well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.

ERICA:
 actually, i don’t think we have to.

MONICA:
 we don’t?

ERICA:
 yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty sure i wanted you, but i just thought we should meet face to face. . i've made my decision. i choose them.

MONICA:
 oh my god, this is great! this is so great! . did you hear that?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i did.

MONICA:
 . you are so going to heaven!   

RACHEL:
 we got some really great stuff!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got.

RACHEL:
 oh! really? do you wanna try some of them on for me? 

PHOEBE:
 oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination?

RACHEL:
  oh no! i took one of ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing.

PHOEBE:
 oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.      

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!

ROSS:
  yeah! yeah! rachel picked it out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what? i'm glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way over here.

JOEY:
  dude, i really don't think you should be wearing that.

ROSS:
 oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?

JOEY:
  looks like someone is the ladies!!

ROSS:
 you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me  all eyes on me!    

CHANDLER:
 we are not signing those papers.

MONICA:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else.

MONICA:
 god works in mysterious ways.

CHANDLER:
 you have gotta stop!

MONICA:
 but she liked us.

CHANDLER:
 she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.

MONICA:
 well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor. 

CHANDLER:
 your veal chop is $34,95!

MONICA:
 c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now.

CHANDLER:
 but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?

MONICA:
  because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.

CHANDLER:
 i know..

MONICA:
 i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us?

CHANDLER:
 oh, honey..

MONICA:
  please.. please, we are so close.

CHANDLER:
 monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to.  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.

MONICA:
  maybe she will. uh! why couldn't i have been a reverend?

CHANDLER:
 you're jewish.

MONICA:
 technicality!   

WAITER:
 a garden salad for the lady 

JOEY:
 oh, that looks great! good ordering!

WAITER:
 seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. enjoy!

SARAH:
 mmmh, those fries look delicious.

JOEY:
 oh, i didn't know you liked french fries. help yourself! what's mine is yours. 

SARAH:
  oh wow, are those stuffed clams?

JOEY:
 uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams. 

JOEY:
 how about those fries though, huh? 

SARAH:
 they are delicious 

JOEY:
  you are beautiful, you know that?

SARAH:
 oh, that is so sweet..

JOEY:
 oh  

JOEY:
  now look what you did!!

SARAH:
 what? what is the matter with you?

JOEY:
 i don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?

SARAH:
 but you just said "what's mine is yours"?

JOEY:
 well, i didn't mean it!

SARAH:
 fine, i'm sorry, i didn't think it was that big a deal.

JOEY:
 i'm sorry, i'm overreacting. okay, it's just when it comes to food, i have certain rules, okay, i mean .       

GIRL:
 wow, this place looks great.

ROSS:
 oh! you are gonna love it!  and i'm so glad, we're finally doing this.

GIRL:
 me too! 

ROSS:
 here    

JOEY:
 i really am sorry about, you know..before. i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you.

SARAH:
 sure  just not as much as clams.

JOEY:
  well, stuffed clams. 

WAITER:
 chocolate torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.

JOEY:
 uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

WAITER:
 yes, that's raspberry coule.

JOEY:
  so stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy. 

SARAH:
 

JOEY:
 oh, all right, i'll just have what she's having instead.

WAITER:
 oh, i'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.

SARAH:
 mmmm! mmm! 

SARAH:
 oh, no! this is work. i should call in. can you excuse me?

JOEY:
 oh yeah, sure. no problem. 

SARAH:
 what are you doing? i thought you don't share food.

JOEY:
 sure i do.  coule?

SARAH:
  no. if i can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. this is a two way street.

JOEY:
  really?

SARAH:
 really! now this all better be here when i come back. 

JOEY:
 yeah, of course. i can control myself.  

JOEY:
  stop staring at me! 

JOEY:
 why, just a tiny little... 

JOEY:
 oh-oh! time lapse 

JOEY:
 i'm not even sorry.   

ERICA:
 hi!

ADOPTION AGENCY GUY:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey.

AGENCY GUY:
 so, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. there's a lot to go over, but i'll explain everything as we go through it.

MONICA:
  i-is... is that a picture?

ERICA:
 yeah. it's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. i thought you might want to see it. 

MONICA:
 look, doctor!  we're not who you think we are.

AGENCY GUY:
 i don't understand.

CHANDLER:
 the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor.

ERICA:
 what?

AGENCY GUY:
 that's impossible.

CHANDLER:
 i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.

AGENCY GUY:
 i'll go check your file. excuse me.

ERICA:
 so who are you?

CHANDLER:
 well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york.

MONICA:
 yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. 

ERICA:
 so you lied to me before?

MONICA:
 well, we...  "bore false witness"... see i could be a reverend.

ERICA:
 i can't believe this. 

MONICA:
 but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...

ERICA:
 giving you my baby? you think i'd give you my child after this?

MONICA:
 well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...

ERICA:
 i don't want to look at your file! this is over. 

CHANDLER:
 erica wait!

ERICA:
 i've nothing to say to you. 

CHANDLER:
 you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.

ERICA:
 why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?

CHANDLER:
 erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising.

ERICA:
 oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. 

CHANDLER:
 but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please? 

CHANDLER:
 you still want that baby? 

MONICA:
 god bless you chandler bing! commercial break 

ROSS:
 turns out this sweater is made for a woman.

JOEY:
  so, why are you still wearing it?

ROSS:
 because it's soft... hey, so how was your date?

JOEY:
 ooh... not so good.

ROSS:
 well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?

JOEY:
 yeah, and you know what? we could do a lot worse.
