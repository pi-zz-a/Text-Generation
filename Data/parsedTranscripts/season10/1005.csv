rachel| you know, i'm thinking about letting emma have her    first cookie.
joey| her first cookie? she has cookies all the time!
rachel| i've never given her a cookie. have you?
joey| no! no... and, for the record, i've also never given her a frosting from    a can!
monica| hey rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we    were wondering if you would write one for us.
rachel| of course, i'd be honored!
chandler| thanks!
monica| thank you! 
joey| u-u-um, i think there's been an oversight.
chandler| joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
monica|" yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with    the words""."
joey| whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
monica| clearly we were wrong.
joey| i gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? and i know how    much you wanna have a baby, you know, and i would love to help you get one.
monica| you know what? then, joey, we want you to do it.
joey|" thank you! alright, let me see how i'm gonna start... ""dear baby    adoption decider people..."""
chandler| so excited about your letter! 
phoebe| hey!
all| hey phoebe!
joey| hey!
monica| wow! don't you look nice?!
phoebe| yes, i do! today is mike and my one-year anniversary.
rachel| oh! what's it the anniversary of? your first date, your first kiss,    first time you had sex...
phoebe| yeah!
chandler| so you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
phoebe| uh-uh. ehm, a knicks game.
joey| uhm... aren't you a little overdressed?
phoebe| hey, you know what, i've never had a one-year anniversary before, so    no matter where we go, i'm wearing something fancy pants, and... i'm gonna put    on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
monica| you guys do that? chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
chandler| that's where people make number two!!  opening credits     
charlie| hey! 
ross| hey...
charlie| so, you know... i have a little time. if you... if you want to...
ross|  ohh... i'd love to    but i really have to grade these papers.
charlie| fine, it's fine...  i'll just shower by myself...
ross|  b, b, b, b, b!
charlie| oh, ross, you gave a b to a pottery barn catalogue.
ross| well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt. 
ross| damnit!
amy|  rachel!! open up!! it's your sister!! (she knocks    on the door again) i have to talk to you!!
ross|  hi amy!
amy| you're not rachel.
ross| still sharp as a tack!
amy| um... charlie, this is rachel's sister amy. amy, this is charlie.
charlie| hi!
amy| hi!
charlie| nice to meet you.
amy| h-hi!! and you are...?
ross|  ross? i... i grew up on your block! we had thanksgiving together    last year... i had a baby with your sister!
amy|  n-no... uhm... did i buy a falafel from you yesterday?
ross|  yes, yes, you did.      
ross| hi rachel! here's your sister amy! she thinks i need   pec implants!  
rachel| amy! hi! oh-oh-hoh!  wow! you remember joey?
amy|" yeah! hey, sure! the ""days of our lives"" guy!"
joey| that's right, yeah.
amy| you're not good!
joey| always nice to meet a fan!
rachel| so now, what are you doing here?
amy| well, i have huge news.
rachel|  oh sorry, hold on. let me just    check on the baby!
amy| wait, this is important! can ella wait? 
ross| ehm... her name is emma.
amy| why did you change it, ella was so much prettier!
ross| what do i know? i just sell middle eastern food from a cart!
amy| hey, your english is getting better!!
ross|  oh my god!
joey| i know, she may be the hottest girl i've ever hated.
ross| what... what you working on?
joey|  oh, monica and chandler's recommendation. i want it    to sound smart but.. i don't know any big words or anything, so...
ross| why don't you use your thesaurus?
joey| what did i just say?
ross| watch.  here, you ehm... you highlight the word    you want to change.   go under tools and the thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list    of choices. you can pick the word that sounds smartest.
joey|" oh my god, that's great! i'm smart!! no, no, i'm...     ""brainy, bright, clever"", i love this thing! look out ladies, joey    tribbiani's got the whole package!!      "
 rachel| god!
amy| so beautiful.
rachel| oh, i know, isn't she?
amy| no, i was talking about your bedding.
rachel| all right. what's your news, amy?
amy| oh! um... well... i'm getting married.
rachel| what? oh my god! to who?
amy| this guy! he has a killer apartment.
rachel| a-and??
amy| a-and it's on fifth. and the elevator opens up right into the living room.
rachel| no, what's he like?
amy| oh! he's ok. do you remember my old boyfriend mark?
rachel| yeah.
amy| it's his dad.
rachel| huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
amy| old? yeah! but he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
rachel| sweety, i gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the    apartment more than you like...
amy| myron. hmm... i told you he was old!
rachel| oh... sit down, sit down. oh, honey, you know, i once also almost married    somebody that i didn’t love. do you remember barry?
amy| humpf, remember him? how we used to make out all the time after you went    to sleep.
rachel| sometimes just nodding is ok.  uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying barry was the best decision that i ever, ever   made. honey, you deserve   true love. your soulmate is out there, somewhere. someone that is your age,   that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
amy|  you’re right, you’re right! i’m gonna    do it!
rachel| ok.
amy| i’m gonna marry myron and keep looking   for mr right.
rachel| ok, let’s keep talking.      
phoebe| excuse me, anniversary. excuse me, anniversary. (looking    at her ticket). uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my    seat. it's my anniversary. . can’t believe    it's been a whole year! 
mike| i know. this has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so    he starts yelling) this has been the best year of my life!
phoebe| me too! i never thought i could love someone this much!
mike| i feel the same way!
phoebe| you’re so generous and kind and  you're    amazing in bed  it’s    our anniversary!
announcer| knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the score board. someone has a special question to ask. (on the    screen there’s written ‘julie, will you marry me?’ and goes    on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)
phoebe| oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.
mike| really?
phoebe| oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
mike|  excuse me... (he leaves, then phoebe realizes  what she did).     
joey| hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to    chandler) here. and i think you’ll be very, very happy. it’s the    longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
chandler|  i don’t... uh... understand.
joey|  some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya?
monica|  it doesn’t make any sense.
joey| of course it does! it’s smart! i used the the-saurus!
chandler| on every word?
joey| yep!
monica| alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to    joey)
joey| oh, ‘they are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
chandler| and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...?
joey| yeah, yeah and hey, i really mean it, dude.
monica| hey joey, i don’t think we can use this.
joey| why not?
monica| well, because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani (joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that'    look). hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself!
chandler| you know what? you don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here,  your full sized aortic pump.      
rachel| amy, hi!
amy| i took your advice, i left myron.
rachel| oh, good for you! 
amy| i know! i'm erin brockovich!
rachel| yes you are! oh, i am so proud of you!
amy| thank you! so, can i stay with you?
rachel| but erin brockovich had her own house. (joey comes out of monica’s apartment and sees rachel and amy but does    not notice the huge amount of bags)
joey| ah, look who’s back!  why do you have bags? rach,    why does she have bags?
amy| well, i’m staying with you guys!
joey| what?
amy| we’re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at joey,  snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) come on!      
joey| you slept out here?
rachel| yeah... amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘myron, get    off!’
joey| but uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? rach, please tell me we’re    getting rid of her.
rachel| joey, i can’t do that!
joey|" oh, come on! last night i was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping    amy badly) ""uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!""    i don’t need that kind of talk in my house!"
rachel| well joey, uhm look, i know that she’s difficult, but i think    it’s really good that she’s here.
joey| 'cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
rachel| no, it's just... look, you know, when i first moved to the city i was    a lot like her! i was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me.
joey| yeah, monica made us!
rachel| well, uhm... whatever, i have really appreciated it, 'cause i don’t    think i would be the person that i am today if it wasn’t for you guys.    see, i wanna help amy the way you guys helped me. and i know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok.
amy| good morning.
joey| yeaah.
rachel| amy, that’s what i was supposed to wear today, that’s why    i hung it on the door.
amy| oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off.
rachel| amy, you know what? i was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
amy| oh, i can’t, honey. i’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points    at her eyebrows) i am not happy.     oh... sure you wanna eat that?
joey|  i’m curvy, and i like it!      
phoebe| hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever.
chandler| i doubt that! tell her about us last year.
monica| oh, well, i bought chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song.
ross| seriously?
chandler| word!
phoebe| well, mine was worse than that.
rachel| well, what happened?
phoebe| we were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing...
rachel| oh, that is so tacky.
phoebe| well, that’s what i said, but it turns out, mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night!
monica| oh my god, mike was gonna propose?
rachel| phoebe, that’s huge!
ross| well, do you wanna marry him?
phoebe| yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, i don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! i mean,    i said no in barbados and now this!
chandler| she's right! if i were a guy and... (stops himself   mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) did i just say if i were a   guy..?
monica| maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him!
phoebe| oh, i don't know, i don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
monica| i proposed to chandler!  alright,    moving on...
chandler| oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!
monica| thank you.
phoebe|  well, do you think   i should propose?
rachel| i think it could be kind of great!
ross| absolutely! you'll love the feeling! there's nothing like it!
phoebe| ok, ok, so how should i do it?
monica| how about at a game, on the big screen?
rachel|  uuuh!! how about at a footlocker? (claps her hands    together, faking excitement)
monica| what? what? he obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it!
phoebe| yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two (points    to ross and chandler) like that?
chandler| sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  
amy| 
rachel|  oh! that's interesting, since she died seven years    ago!!
amy| she did? who got her condo in boca?
rachel|  oh, it's our nanny! (goes    back to the phone conversation) hi! oh... god! i hope you feel better! ok, bye!     that's molly, she's sick. can you watch emma today?
ross| no, i can't. i have back-to-back classes. did molly say what she had?    because my throat's been hurting?
rachel| menstrual cramps.
ross| i don't think that's what this is.
rachel|  can any of you watch emma?
monica| no, sorry sweety..
phoebe| no, i've got work and then i'm proposing..
rachel|  great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
amy| well, i can do it.
rachel|  well, actually... 
ross| (he interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other    side of the room) well, can i talk to you for a sec.?
rachel| yeah.
ross| um, i do not want her baby-sitting our child.
rachel| why not?
ross| well, for one thing, she keeps calling her ella! 
rachel|  wha.. well, ella's a nice name!
ross| fine, we'll call the next one ella.
rachel|  wha... the next one?
ross|  okay, um... i don't want her watching our baby.
rachel| ross, i am trying to help her become a better person. this is a huge    breakthrough for her! she just offered to do something for another human being!!
ross| i... i don't know..
rachel| ross, i'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points    at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? do you understand    how important that is in our world? 
amy| um... listen, i couldn't help but overhear... 'cause i was trying to...    listen, let me do this alright? i really wanna help you guys out, and plus rachel's    been so wonderful to me...  
rachel| absolutely.
amy|  oh! great! so how much does it pay? (ross just gives up  and leaves)      
chandler| hey joe! how's the second draft of the letter coming?
joey| great, i'm finished! in fact, i just dropped it off at the agency. 
monica| you dropped it off?
joey| yeah.
chandler| can we read it? can you print out another copy?
joey| no can do amigo. no, i didn't use the computer. felt more personal to    hand-write it. 
monica| you hand-wrote it?
joey| yeah, and don't worry. i didn't try to sound smart at   all! see ya later! 
monica| oh my god, oh my god, that letter is gonna go in our    file! we're never gonna get a kid. no, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
chandler| it's ok, it's ok. you know what?  i'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. 
monica| okay good.
chandler|  hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  uh-huh... uh-huh...    okay... thank you. good-bye. .
monica| ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? you know what? just tell me on the way    to the bird store.
chandler|  they loved it.
monica| what?
chandler| they thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter.
monica|  they thought joey was a child?
chandler| she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. 
amy| hi!
monica| hey, what did you guys do today?
amy| ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
chandler| that sounds like fun.
amy| yeah, not really. babies are dull. 
rachel|  hey! hi, how's my girl?
amy| i'm fine! and, i got you a present for letting me stay with you. ready?
rachel|  yeah! 
amy| ta-daaa! 
rachel|  you pierced her ears!?
amy|  doesn't it make her nose look smaller?  commercial break 
rachel| you pierced her ears? how could you do this without telling me? 
amy| well, if i had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would    it?
chandler| i think she looks cute.     ... but i am wrong!
rachel| oh my god, oh my god, here comes ross. he's gonna flip out.
amy| why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
rachel| ugh.  
ross| hey guys.  
monica and chandler| hi ross.
ross| hey emma. oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? she can barely see.    .
rachel| nah, i don't really want her to see. 
ross| why not?
monica| because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
chandler| like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
ross| come here  oh! there she is! hi! 
ross|  what?
rachel| nothing.
ross|  what... (moves the stroller away from    him so he can get a better look at her. he looks at her confused. finally he    realizes the difference and gasps). please tell me those are clip-ons. 
rachel| oh, they're real!
ross| did she  do this to her? i told you we shouldn't have    left emma with her!
rachel| i know, i know, and you were right ross.    you are soo irresponsible   i am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
amy| hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? she needs    to have a cool fun aunt!
monica| i'm a cool, fun aunt!
amy|  o-okay!
chandler| hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
rachel| i can't believe this. all i wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
amy| well, i don't need you to help me, because i already know what i'm going    to do with my life.
rachel| oh yeah? since when?
amy| since today... i am going to be a baby stylist.
rachel|  what?
ross| that's not a thing!
amy| well, it should be. i'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what    colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
rachel|  babies don't care if they're slim.
amy| enter amy!
ross|  amy, i ju... i just... i just wanna...
amy| what? what are you gonna do?
ross|"  no more falafel for you! (amy looks at ross, angrily. rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant  and looks at ross who gestures ""later"".)      "
mike| great game, huh?
phoebe| uhuh, uhuh... 
mike| why do you keep looking at the screen?
phoebe| i'm not. i'm praying.  please let the knicks win... thank    you thor!  where... where are you going?
mike| going go to the bathroom.
phoebe| well, i think you should wait.
mike| why?
phoebe| well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients.
announcer| knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the scoreboard. someone has a special question to ask.
(we see the screen where it says|" ""mike will you marry me?"" and then    we see phoebe and mike on the screen. phoebe stands up and kneels in front of    mike.)"
phoebe| mike hannigan... will you marry me? 
announcer| get a load of this... she's proposing   to him. guess we know who wears the pants in that family.   (people are laughing, while   mike still seems bewildered)
phoebe| that's not very enlightened! (there's booing around them, and mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand    in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him)
phoebe| hey, hey!  boo us? boo you!      
joey|  hello? yeah, this is joey tribbiani...    oh, hi! well, i'm glad you liked my letter... no my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now...  she was    nice! 
rachel| joey, get amy's bags, she is moving out!
joey| whoo-hoo! 
amy| you're kicking me out? 
rachel| you put holes in my baby's ears!
amy| yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
rachel|  i can't believe i ever even tried to help   you. you are so  beyond help.
amy| you know what? ever since i got here, you have been nothing but negative.
rachel| excuse me?
amy| you didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. then,    i tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing    at her nose) and suddenly i am the bad guy?
rachel|  joey, where are those bags?
joey|  she has a lot of crap!
amy| you know what? when i moved in here i thought: this is gonna be so great.    just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without    that stupid jill... oh! who has gotten fat by the way...
rachel|  seriously?
amy| hm-mmm... mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
rachel| hips or thighs?
amy| ass and face.
rachel|  oh! oh my god! i thought she was on atkins.
amy| she was. carbs found her... see, this is what i wanted. two sisters, talking    about real stuff.
rachel|  oh, i can give you that.
amy| you can?
rachel| yeah. i just, i kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...    you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
amy|  thank you. i've got to admit, emma does look cute.
rachel| did you just say emma?
amy| ugh, i'm sorry... ella.    
phoebe| that woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about. mike, obviously you have balls.
mike| but please, let's just forget the whole thing.
phoebe|  i would love it. consider    it forgotten... but just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    i promise i'll say yes. whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake. 
phoebe| it's in the cake, isn't it?
mike|  where else would lame mr. no balls hide it? (he    takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)
phoebe| what's the matter with me? how do i keep ruining this? i'm sorry, i'm    sorry!
mike| no! it's my fault. i keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and    all i wanna do is tell you that i love you and i want to spend the rest of my    life with you. 
mike| i'm gonna do this now.
phoebe| oh my god! 
mike| phoebe, i...
phoebe| wait! oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring    finger. after that mike starts to kneel again, but then...) oh no! (she was    wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
mike| ready?
phoebe| uh-huh! 
mike| phoebe, i love you. there's no-one else in the world i would ask to marry    me... three times. but i wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow    old with you... phoebe buffay, will you marry me?
phoebe| yes! 
mike| i love you!
phoebe| i love you more!
mike| not possible!  she's gonna    be mrs. no balls.  commercial break      
rachel| so how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
amy| not that great. it's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies    are ugly. 
rachel| that's shocking!
