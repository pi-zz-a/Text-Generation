chandler|  hi!
ross| hey!
monica| hey!
chandler| we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio.
phoebe| oh, right! your adoption interview!
monica| yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
joey| i can't believe it. when you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! that is so weird!
chandler| and so incorrect!
monica| she's only a couple of months pregnant. she liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
ross| come on, she's gonna love you guys!
chandler| uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
monica| and a lot could still get in our way.
chandler| yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
phoebe| what are you gonna name the baby?
chandler| i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word.
joey| but just think, ok? what if everything goes right? what if this woman does pick you guys?
monica| oh my god. she's gonna pick us!
chandler| so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
monica| you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna have a baby chandler, a baby!
chandler| yes, but...
monica| oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and 
chandler| oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!!  opening credits  
rachel|  hey, who's phoebe with?
joey| i'm gonna say someone i'm gonna have sex with.  hey!
phoebe| hey!
joey| so... who's your friend?
phoebe| oh, that's sarah. no, no. don't you get any ideas, ok? no, i'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
joey| ow, why, why, why?
phoebe| because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
joey| oh, name one friend of yours that i did that with.
phoebe| mandy.
joey| mandy, uh? uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
phoebe| no.
joey| i know why i don't remember her, huh? 
rachel| do you think i'm someone else?
joey| ok, i may not have treated your friends well in the past, but i have grown up a lot, really. honest, rach?
rachel| well, believe it or not, it's true. when joey and i were together, he was wonderful. he was thoughtful and mature. and for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
joey|  growth!
phoebe| fine, i'll give you her number.
joey| ok, thank you. and i promise you i will not forget this one.  mandy.
phoebe| sarah!
joey| saraaah.
ross|  hey!
rachel| hi!
ross| hey you guys, i need some fashion advice.
rachel| oh!
ross|  how does this look?
rachel| well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  now throw it away!
ross| c'mon! this looks good!
rachel| ross, please, trust me. i buy 30 fashion magazines a month. now, i don't know who's running for president or who that... nato guy is, but i do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
ross| damnit! i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool!
phoebe| well, you know, if you want fashion help, rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow. you're more than welcome to come with us, right?
ross| really? that would be great. i mean, i have to do something, she kinda teased me about how i dress. 
joey| i can see why, nice shirt!
ross| you're wearing the same shirt.
joey| stupid gap on every corner!   
agency guy| please, make yourself comfortable and i will back in a moment with erica.
monica| ok, thank you. uh, well this is it. are you ok?
chandler|" yeah. just weird, you know. it's like: ""hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?"""
monica| uh, we're gonna be great.
chandler| you're gonna be great.
monica| well... obviously!
agency guy|  monica, chandler. i'd like you to meet erica.
monica| hi. it is so, so nice to meet you.
erica|  hi...
chandler| thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
erica| hi.
agency guy| i'll let you get acquainted.
chandler| ok.
erica| so, it's monica and chandler. i only know you as file 0w33815-d.
chandler| that's what our friends call us.
erica| gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. it's... kind of intimidating.
monica| i don't know about that.
erica| you're kidding me? i mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
chandler|  i don't think that's exactly...
monica|  let her finish, doctor.    
phoebe| hey!
joey| hey.
phoebe| oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night.
joey| well...
phoebe| yeah! so you're gonna call this one back?
joey| nope.
phoebe| what are you talking about? sarah's great!
joey| oh, really? you know what your great friend did? we're out to dinner, ok?  we're getting along, having a really nice time. i was thinking she was really cool. and then, out of nowhere...  
phoebe| that’s it? that’s why you won’t go out with her again? so, she took some fries, big deal!
joey| hey, hey, look! it’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
phoebe| what?
joey| all food!
phoebe| i’m sorry, i can’t believe i set you up with such a monster!
joey| hey, hey, hey, hey. look. i take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! the more, the better! all right? just don’t order a garden salad and then eat my food! that’s a good way to lose some fingers! 
phoebe|  oh
rachel| hi
phoebe| thank god you’re here. listen to this!
rachel| what?
phoebe| joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
rachel| oh! oh, no! 
phoebe| what? you know about the plate thing?
rachel| oh, yeah. joey doesn’t share food. i mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
phoebe|  you wouldn’t let her have a grape?
rachel| oh no! not me! emma! 
joey|  joey doesn’t share food!
phoebe| well, i still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. you are calling her! and if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
joey|  what were we talking about?  
phoebe|  this place is awesome!
ross| you know, we should just go, i’m not gonna find anything here! this stuff is ridiculous!  
rachel| ah, this place is great!
phoebe| wow!
ross| rach, come on, i’m not gonna wear any of this! .
rachel| ross, look, i know that some of this stuff is out there, but i mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . i mean, this is just beautiful!
ross| . three hundred and fifty dollars?
rachel| yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
ross| both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
phoebe | hey, check this out! it’s totally you!
ross| wow!
phoebe| yeah! 
ross| actually this looks like pretty good! yeah! boys will be boys?
phoebe| what? they will be!
ross| all right, that’s it, i’m getting out of here.
rachel| no, no, no, no! ross, wait! come on! you know, there’s other stuff. here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
ross| uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
rachel| yes, they will! you know what you should do? just go take a walk, all right? i know your size and i’m... i’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
ross| really?
rachel| yes! and i know what looks sexy on guys. please, just wear what i suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
ross| so, you’re saying, uh, if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers?
rachel|  why do men keep talking to me like this?   
chandler| so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
erica| yeah, i read some great applications, but then i thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”
monica| amen.
chandler| plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
monica| uh, good hands.  healing hands.
erica| reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything about adoption?
monica| it says “do it!”. and behold she did adopt onto them a baby. and it was good.
erica| wow.
chandler| yeah, wow.
erica| i was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
monica| oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. good flock. flock, flock, flock.
erica|  being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
chandler| no-ot for me it doesn’t. 
agency guy| so, how’s everything going in here?
erica| we’re great, i think i may have asked all my questions.
agency guy| do you have any question for erica?
chandler| yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
agency guy| yes, our system assures total anonimity. we’re very proud of it.
chandler| you should be. you’re really on top of stuff..
agency guy|  well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
erica| actually, i don’t think we have to.
monica| we don’t?
erica| yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty sure i wanted you, but i just thought we should meet face to face. . i've made my decision. i choose them.
monica| oh my god, this is great! this is so great! . did you hear that?
chandler| yeah, i did.
monica| . you are so going to heaven!   
rachel| we got some really great stuff!
phoebe| yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got.
rachel| oh! really? do you wanna try some of them on for me? 
phoebe| oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination?
rachel|  oh no! i took one of ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing.
phoebe| oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.      
ross| 
joey| i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
ross|  yeah! yeah! rachel picked it out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what? i'm glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
joey|  dude, i really don't think you should be wearing that.
ross| oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
joey|  looks like someone is the ladies!!
ross| you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me  all eyes on me!    
chandler| we are not signing those papers.
monica| why not?
chandler| it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else.
monica| god works in mysterious ways.
chandler| you have gotta stop!
monica| but she liked us.
chandler| she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.
monica| well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor. 
chandler| your veal chop is $34,95!
monica| c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now.
chandler| but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?
monica|  because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
chandler| i know..
monica| i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us?
chandler| oh, honey..
monica|  please.. please, we are so close.
chandler| monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to.  
monica| 
chandler| so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
monica|  maybe she will. uh! why couldn't i have been a reverend?
chandler| you're jewish.
monica| technicality!   
waiter| a garden salad for the lady 
joey| oh, that looks great! good ordering!
waiter| seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. enjoy!
sarah| mmmh, those fries look delicious.
joey| oh, i didn't know you liked french fries. help yourself! what's mine is yours. 
sarah|  oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
joey| uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams. 
joey| how about those fries though, huh? 
sarah| they are delicious 
joey|  you are beautiful, you know that?
sarah| oh, that is so sweet..
joey| oh  
joey|  now look what you did!!
sarah| what? what is the matter with you?
joey| i don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
sarah|" but you just said ""what's mine is yours""?"
joey| well, i didn't mean it!
sarah| fine, i'm sorry, i didn't think it was that big a deal.
joey| i'm sorry, i'm overreacting. okay, it's just when it comes to food, i have certain rules, okay, i mean .       
girl| wow, this place looks great.
ross| oh! you are gonna love it!  and i'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
girl| me too! 
ross| here    
joey| i really am sorry about, you know..before. i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you.
sarah| sure  just not as much as clams.
joey|  well, stuffed clams. 
waiter| chocolate torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
joey| uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
waiter| yes, that's raspberry coule.
joey|  so stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy. 
sarah| 
joey| oh, all right, i'll just have what she's having instead.
waiter| oh, i'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
sarah| mmmm! mmm! 
sarah| oh, no! this is work. i should call in. can you excuse me?
joey| oh yeah, sure. no problem. 
sarah| what are you doing? i thought you don't share food.
joey| sure i do.  coule?
sarah|  no. if i can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. this is a two way street.
joey|  really?
sarah| really! now this all better be here when i come back. 
joey| yeah, of course. i can control myself.  
joey|  stop staring at me! 
joey| why, just a tiny little... 
joey| oh-oh! time lapse 
joey| i'm not even sorry.   
erica| hi!
adoption agency guy| hey.
chandler| hey.
agency guy| so, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. there's a lot to go over, but i'll explain everything as we go through it.
monica|  i-is... is that a picture?
erica| yeah. it's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. i thought you might want to see it. 
monica| look, doctor!  we're not who you think we are.
agency guy| i don't understand.
chandler| the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor.
erica| what?
agency guy| that's impossible.
chandler| i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
agency guy| i'll go check your file. excuse me.
erica| so who are you?
chandler| well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york.
monica| yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. 
erica| so you lied to me before?
monica|" well, we...  ""bore false witness""... see i could be a reverend."
erica| i can't believe this. 
monica| but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
erica| giving you my baby? you think i'd give you my child after this?
monica| well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
erica| i don't want to look at your file! this is over. 
chandler| erica wait!
erica| i've nothing to say to you. 
chandler| you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
erica| why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
chandler| erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising.
erica| oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. 
chandler| but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please? 
chandler| you still want that baby? 
monica| god bless you chandler bing! commercial break 
ross| turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
joey|  so, why are you still wearing it?
ross| because it's soft... hey, so how was your date?
joey| ooh... not so good.
ross| well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
joey| yeah, and you know what? we could do a lot worse.
