rachel| pheebs? could you get that? please?
phoebe| why? just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? 
rachel| no! no! it's just that all the people in the entire world that i want to talk to are right here.
phoebe| 
rachel|  sucker!
phoebe|  hey joey! 
joey| hey pheebs! listen, uh can you do me a favor? i forgot the pin number to my atm card can, can you get it for me?
phoebe| sure! where is it?
joey| uh, i scratched it on the atm machine down on the corner.
phoebe| ohh! so you're 5639?!
joey| that's it! thanks pheebs! 
chandler|  hey!
phoebe|  ooh, do you want to talk to chandler?
chandler|  let me talk to him! 
joey| no!  because he didn't believe in my movie! which is a big mistake because it is real! real!
a casino boss| hey! tribbiani! get back to work! break time's over! 
phoebe| who was that?
joey| uhh, my stunt double. yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
chandler|  y'know what? i have been trying to apologize to him all week! if he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, i'm gonna go down there and do it in person. 
joey| uhh pheebs, i heard that. can you put him on? 
phoebe| yeah! 
chandler|  hey! 
joey| don't come out here! 
chandler| no-no-no-no, i've supported you one hundred percent and i want to prove that to you in person! 
joey| i got that! i forgive ya! don't come out here! 
chandler| forgive me? you haven't been taking my calls in a week! 
joey| well, i'm totally over it chandler. friends forever! don't come out here!
a tourist|  would you mind doing a picture with us? 
chandler| uh, what was that? 
joey| uh, entertainment tonight.  talking to ya and don't come out here. all right. (hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.) opening credits 
phoebe| monica! i'm sorry i'm late!  monica? 
monica|  oh, phoebe, i'm so sorry. have you been here long?
phoebe|  it's okay. what the hell took you so long?
monica| okay, you can not tell chandler. okay? that i ran into richard.
phoebe| which richard?
monica| the richard.
phoebe| richard simmons?! oh my god!
monica| noo! my ex-boyfriend richard! y'know the tall guy, moustache? 
phoebe| oh! okay, that actually makes more sense. so how was it?
monica| it was, it was really nice. we started talking and i-i ended up having lunch with him.
phoebe| that is so weird! i had a dream that you'd have lunch with richard.
monica| really?
phoebe| but again, simmons. go on.
monica| the strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but i didn't feel anything at all!
phoebe| ooh! so now why can't we tell chandler?
monica| because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. i just don't want anything to spoil that.
phoebe| oh, i can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
monica| i know.
phoebe| wow! i owe rachel 20 bucks!
monica| what?
phoebe| on a totally different bet.
chandler|  hey!
monica| it's almost our anniversary!
chandler| i know. can you believe it? one year ago today i was just your annoying friend chandler.
phoebe| awww! now you're just my annoying friend chandler.
chandler| huh.
monica| i got you a present!
chandler| oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
monica| i know, but you have to open it today! 
chandler| okay. 
monica|  okay! there you go! it's two tickets to vegas!
chandler| wow!
monica| for this weekend! oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. we can call it out plane-aversary.
chandler| do we have to?
monica| no.
chandler| okay this is great, but joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
monica| oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! plus we get to have our own, ani-vegas-ary! a-nevadaversary!
chandler| yeah, i think we should see other people.
monica| but we can go, right?
chandler| yes.
monica| okay!
chandler| it's a great idea. 
phoebe| okay, i'm gonna go too!
chandler| y'know pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.
phoebe| oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with london.
monica| ditch you? phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
phoebe| uh-huh, great story! i'm going!
rachel|  hi!
phoebe| hey!
ross| hey!
phoebe| hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to las vegas to surprise joey! including me!! you wanna go?!
rachel| well, i guess i could take a couple days off work.
phoebe| of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
rachel| oh no, wait a minute, wait, i've got a presentation tomorrow. i can't miss that.
ross| oh, but i've got tickets to the van gogh exhibit! i've been waiting like a year for this.
chandler|  art lover!
ross| what'd you say?
chandler| i said art lover.
ross| is that supposed to be an insult?
chandler| i don't know, i'm very tired. 
ross| so rach, maybe you and i could fly out together saturday.
rachel| that sounds great.
ross| yeah? all right i'll call the airlines. 
rachel| okay. yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
phoebe| oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
rachel| no! so i can be by myself. y'know? have a little alone time.
phoebe| naked alone time.
rachel| no! phoebe just because i'm alone doesn’t mean i wanna walk around naked. i mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
phoebe| uh-huh! why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?  
phoebe| so, so far is this trip to vegas better or worse than the trip to london?
chandler| so it's pretty much the same pheebs.
phoebe| okay, what about after i give you these candies? (hands them each one from her purse.)
chandler| yeah, i guess it's a little better now.
phoebe| ah-ha! okay,  las vegas 1, london 0! i'll be right back. 
chandler|  happy plane-aversary.
monica| aww! i love you!
chandler| can i give you a present now?
monica| okay!
chandler| okay!  oh man! don’t tell me i did this!
monica|" i love the ""i forgot the present"" fake out!"
chandler|" how do you feel about the, ""i really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?"
monica| oh that's okay. don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
chandler| ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
phoebe|  oh good! all right, so you decided to tell him about the richard thing.
chandler| what-what richard thing?
phoebe| oh no. 
chandler| what richard thing?
phoebe|  simmons! go with simmons!
monica| okay, i umm, i ran into richard yesterday and he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did. the only reason i didn't tell you is because i knew you'd get mad and i didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
chandler|  i'm not mad.
monica| really?!
chandler| oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! it's no big deal. 
monica| great! 
phoebe| okay, london 1…  wearing only her bath robe, walks into the kitchen, and opens the fridge. as she bends over to grab a bottle of wine, her robe falls open (damn this network primetime programming, we didn't see anything!) and she quickly closes it again. but then realizes she didn't have to do that. so she closes the fridge and stands next to the table, thinks 
rachel|  oh! look what happened! {don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. its times like these i wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than denis franz's butt.} (in her head.) huh, check me out! i'm in my kitchen…naked! i'm picking up an orange. (does so) i'm naked!  lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (she backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)  
ross|  oh my god! that's rachel naked! i can't look at that! i am looking at this.  okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—unless she wants me to be looking at that. she knows i'm home. she knows i can see her. what kind of game is she playing? i think maybe someone's lonely tonight. oh-ho, dr. geller! stop it! you're being silly! or, am i?   dancing while facing the big picture window. y'know, i think i'd pay real good money to be 
rachel|  love to love ya baby! ow! love to love ya baby! ow! (there's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) love to love ya, baby!  darnit! (looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) ugh. (she opens the door to ross who's leaning against the door jam.) 
ross| hey. commercial break  
ross| may i come in?
rachel| uh, yeah, if you want too.
ross| do you want me too?
rachel| yeah, sure?
ross|" so do i.  okay rach, before anything happens (he takes off his coat) i just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.  this is just about tonight. i don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""us.""  okay? i just want this to be (kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! "
rachel| and um, what-what is that ross?
ross| the physical act of love. 
rachel|  what?! are you crazy?
ross| oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
rachel|  oh god, you saw me?! oh!
ross| you weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
rachel| noo!! no! you thought, you actually thought i wanted to have sex with you?!
ross| no! no!  no-no-no-no. (grabs the other one and heads for the door.)
rachel| ohh wow! i’m sorry, but ross you kicked off your shoes!
ross| can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
rachel| yes of course, absolutely! you're right. i'm sorry.
ross| thank you.
rachel| yes.
ross| all right i guess i'm, gonna go pack. 
rachel|" okay. oh wait! one more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of ""us?""   machines, a couple other gaming tables all set to the tune of you guessed it, money. anyhoo, we finally get through that and watch chandler, monica, and phoebe enter caesar's "
phoebe| hey you guys wait! guys!  this place is so much better than london! okay? this lady dressed like cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. huh!
monica| phoebe, you don't eat animals. 
phoebe| for 99 cents, i'd eat you.  okay, i can totally settle down here. it's got everything i could ever want, including joey! look! (points to joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) oh! look! hi!
chandler| oh my god.
phoebe| hey! joey!  hey! hey!! wow! 
joey| hi!
chandler| love your condoms my man.
joey| what-what are you guys doing here? i thought i told you not to come.
phoebe| why are you dressed as a gladiator?
joey| uhh, because i'm shooting a scene right now. yeah, i uh, i play a gladiator. uh, y'know what? hold-hold on a second.  can we cut? yeah, my-my friends are here, i'm gonna take a little break.
monica| who are you talking too?
joey| they uh director. uhh, her. (points to an old woman standing behind him. who glares at him and walks off.) all right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. i work here.
chandler| why?! what happened?!
joey| well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so i'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
monica| i'm so sorry.
joey| look, i'm sorry i didn't tell ya.  i'm sorry man.
chandler| no-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
monica| i knew you were not okay with that.
phoebe| so you're a gladiator! wow!
joey| yeah, what-what's going on?
phoebe| monica had lunch with richard.
joey| dawson?! 
phoebe| noo! but that would've been so cool!
chandler| no! her boyfriend richard!
monica| it meant nothing! okay? after all this time, how can you not trust me?
chandler| when you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
monica| you're right. i'm sorry. i should've told you.
chandler| thanks. 
joey| aww, there we go.
phoebe| i love vegas!
monica| i promise you, next time i will absolutely tell you.
chandler|  next time?
joey| ooh, so close.
chandler| there's not gonna be a next time! you can not ever see him again!
monica| i can not see him? i mean, you can't tell me what to do!
chandler| that's so funny, because i think i just did!
monica| oh y'know what? if you're gonna be acting like this all night, i really, i don't even want to be around you.
chandler| fine with me!
monica| fine! happy anniversary!
joey| whoa! whoa! guys! please! come on! come on! this is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
monica| no it is not!
chandler| what are you talking…
joey| hey-hey don't look at me! i just work here!  
rachel|  okay umm, ross? i'm-i'm really warm, so i'm going to be taking off my sweater. now, i'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
ross|  yep! that's hilarious!
rachel| i'm sorry. i'm done. i'm done.
ross| y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
rachel| no, not really. i mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
ross| uh-huh. but it was a first for the rest of my building.
rachel| okay. all right, that's true! but y'know i just don't embarrass that easily.
ross| what?! you totally get embarrassed!
rachel| no, i don't! ross, i think i'm just a more secure person than you are.
ross| is that so?
rachel| yeah. 
ross|  hey lady! i don't care how much you want it! okay?! i am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)  
joey| hey, y'know in roman times this was more than just a hat.
chandler| really?
joey| yeah, sure! sure! they would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! they would use it to get the mud off their shoe. and sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…
chandler|  joey, i uh! i can't believe this is how i'm spending my anniversary.
joey| all right well, i'll take you someplace nice then. look! a guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
chandler| whoa!
joey| yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. can you believe that? $5,000!
chandler| y'know, if i won $5,000 i'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit richard from behind with a stick! 
joey| wait a minute! why don't i do what that guy did? i'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! and then i'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
chandler| good luck! 
joey| chandler! i don't need luck. i have thought this through!
chandler| i see.  commercial break  
monica|  thank you.
phoebe| thanks.
monica| i can't believe this! this is like the worst night ever!
phoebe| y'know monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with chandler. big deal! it's only chandler.  i am so sorry.
monica| this is crazy! i mean, it's such a stupid argument. i don't even wanna see richard again.
phoebe| so go fix it! go find chandler! he's probably up in your room! tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
monica| y'know what? you're right phoebe. you're right. thank you! (gets up to find chandler.)
phoebe| sure!  yeah! las vegas, number one!  
monica| anybody lose this? (holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)
the croupier| comin' out. place your bet.  dice are out. (the woman next to monica rolls the dice.) double or nothin'! pay the front line! (monica won and doubled the chip.)
monica| hmm.  
guy|  so uh, i'm on my way back to the bathroom. (ross giggles.)
rachel| yeah, all right. all right! just keep walkin'! all right? (ross keeps giggling and rachel decides upon revenge. she gets up and kisses the rather large man in the seat in front of ross on the back of his head. the guy turns around angrily.)
rachel| ross! what are you… i'm sorry sir. i just, i think he just really likes you. 
ross|  hey! y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?   
ross| what the? what…
rachel| (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. it was only seconds after rachel pushed the call button was she there. once again, more proof that tv isn't real, irl she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then ross's pants would be dry.) hi! 
the flight attendant| miss? may i help you?
rachel| yes, i'm sorry. do you have any extra pants? umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.  
joey| 
blackjack dealer| changing one hundred!  good luck sir.
joey|  let's ride.
blackjack dealer|  13.
joey| hit me!  ohh man! (joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards joey notices something.) wait! (he holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.) 
joey| chandler! you are not gonna believe this! i have found my identical hand twin!
chandler|  what?
joey| my identical hand twin!
chandler| what's an identical hand twin?
joey| what's it sound like? it's a guy with my identical hands! it was incredible! chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! it-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
chandler| are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
joey| don’t you see what this means?! i can forget about that stupid movie. i'm gonna be a millionaire!
chandler|  how?
joey| look, i don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! come on! identical hands!
chandler| again i must go back to, how?
joey| this is vegas man! people will pay to see freaky stuff! okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice? huh?
chandler|  y'know, i-i can't really put a price on that joe.
joey| hey, are you unsupporting me again?
chandler| no! no! i support you 100%! i just didn't, i didn't get it right away. y'know now i'm caught up! identical hand twins! it's a million-dollar idea! (joey starts to leave to embark on his genius moneymaking scheme, but is freaked out slightly when as he goes to open the door, there's a mysterious knock. he calms himself down and opens the door to reveal phoebe.)
phoebe| hey!
joey| pheebs!!
phoebe| yeah?
joey| i found my identical hand twin!
phoebe| ohh, you are so lucky!  hey! so, where's monica? did you guys make up?
chandler| no!
phoebe| but she just came up here!
chandler| that was joey!
phoebe| i wonder where she is. that is so weird.
chandler| yeah, well, she's probably talking to richard.
phoebe| would you stop that! do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with richard? she didn't feel anything for him. she loves you!
chandler| really?
phoebe| yes! now, she feels terrible! she really wants to make up! you gotta find her.
chandler| okay. 
phoebe|" good. (after he leaves, she puts on joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) i should really start wearing hats!  signature song is playing in the background (getting the theme yet? tom jones, wayne newton, casinos… they're in vegas people! catch up!) it's not unusual, y'know, ""it's not unusual to be loved by anyone! it's not unusual to have fun with anyone!   but when i see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry!   i wanna die."" well, while that's playing he spots monica playing craps and   asleep against his shoulder. she shifts a little bit and ross suddenly gets an idea. an evil idea when he looks at his pen. then we have a little time lapse, the plane has landed "
the flight attendant|  welcome to las vegas. (rachel approaches and we see the fruits of ross's evil plan. he has drawn a moustache and beard on rachel. the flight attendant just ignores it.)
the flight attendant|  thank you! (not sure of herself) enjoy your flight?
rachel| yes, i did. thank you very much, it was excellent. 
the flight attendant|  hope you had a nice flight.
ross| ohh, it was the best! commercial break 
ross| i think the check in is that way. 
rachel| ahh. 
rachel| hello! (she makes a face and the kid laughs harder. finally, his parents drag him off.) ohh, kids love me.
phoebe|  hey!
ross| phoebe!  
phoebe| you guys are here! yay!
rachel| hi! 
phoebe|  what? did you go to a costume party? let me guess umm pancho vila?  and you're bob saget. (an old lady has sat down at the slot machine phoebe was just at.)
rachel| pancho vila?
phoebe|" yeah! (motions to her face, indicating all of rachel's ""make-up."")"
rachel| what are you talking about pheebs?  i don't…  oh my god, you drew on me?!
ross| hey, you wet my pants!
phoebe| whoa, what kind of party was this?
rachel| ross, i have been walking around like this since the plane! i can—you have so crossed a line. 
ross| rach! wait! the men's room is that way. (points in the other direction. rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.) 
phoebe| ugh!
ross| what?
phoebe| that's like the third time that lady's won on a machine i was playing.
ross| oooohhh, i'll bet she's one of those people.
phoebe| m-m-mole people?
ross| what? no-no, a lurker.
phoebe| oh. what's a lurker?
ross| okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…
phoebe| kills you?
ross| no. they swoop in and steal your jackpot.
phoebe| ohhh!
ross| uh-hmm.
phoebe| how do you know about this?
ross| my nana used to do it. that's how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.
phoebe| dance karate?
ross| yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)
rachel|  all right, it won't come off!
ross| what?!
rachel| it won't come off!
ross| oh my god! rach-rach, are-are-are you sure?
rachel| no, actually i took it off then i drew it back on.
joey|  hey-hey-hey you made it!
ross| joey!!
joey| all right! hey-hey!
rachel| hi!!
joey| who's your friend? he's hot! (ross laughs and rachel smacks him with her purse.)
ross|  thanks man.
rachel| hi. 
ross| hey listen i uh, talked to chandler, sorry about the movie.
joey| no, don't be sorry. i don't need it anymore. i found my identical hand twin!
ross| your what?
joey| my identical hand twin! the person whose hands are exactly like mine! this thing is a gold mine!
ross| what?! that's not gonna make you any money!
joey| okay. well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! none of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! except uh, you pheebs. you can live in the thumb. 
monica| all right baby, come on!  yes! yes! i am on fire!
chandler|  see you later mon.
monica| wait chandler, what are you doing?!
chandler| what does it look like? i'm going home.
monica| what? wait! why? (he turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) chandler! chandler! wait! i’m sorry, i was just playing for one second! i was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see richard again, i won't! he means nothing to me!
chandler| come on! i was there! (he's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. he winces and pulls his hand away.) i know he's the love of your life.
monica| not any more.
chandler| really?!
monica| really!  all right? let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary.  okay, this is empty.
chandler| yeah, i wanted to make a dramatic scene, but i hate packing.  
joey|  uhh, hey. where's the other guy?
the woman dealer| which guy?
joey| he's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (holds up his hand.) see?
the woman dealer| i don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
joey| okay!  how you doin'?
the woman dealer| very busy.
joey| right! okay.   ross is on the phone to the company. wait a minute, why exactly are they sharing a hotel room? didn't they like break-up or something? did i miss a memo? or maybe, it's just foreshadowing things to come. who knows? maybe the answer's at the bottom of the page. then again, maybe it isn't and it's just one of those things tv writers just don't 
ross|  yes, hello. i have a question. umm, i used your pen to draw on my friend's face.  thank you.  i know it's like  anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. what-what do we do?  oh! okay.  (hangs up the phone) yeah, it's not coming off.
rachel| what?! what else did he say?
ross| umm, he said he thought i was funny. so… okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
rachel| ross, no! there is no way i am leaving this room looking like this!
ross| oh, come on! rach, it's-it's not that bad.
rachel| ross, i am a human doodle!!
ross| look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! okay? and besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. okay? this is vegas! hello! there are tons of other freaks here! (rachel turns around and glares at him.) there are tons…of…freaks here. no other. no. come on! no one will notice, i swear!  
ross| okay, there was some staring and pointing.
rachel| okay, i need a, i need a drink! 
ross| oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (rachel glares at him.) but who cares?! because it's all on me! (rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.)  that is, one big drink! 
rachel|  macadamia nut?
ross|  umm… wow! that's-that's some pricey nut!
rachel| hm-mmm! 
ross| really like those macadamia nuts, huh?
rachel| nope! (she puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)  
phoebe|  go on! get! 
chandler|  hey pheebs!
phoebe| ohh! you made up!
monica| yeah, i couldn't be mad at him for too long.
chandler| yeah, she couldn't live without the chan love. 
phoebe| ohh, get a room.
monica| we have one.
phoebe| i know. use it. 
joey| oh-oh-oh, yeah!  that's right, you take good care of those babies!
joey's hand twin| excuse me?
joey| it's me, joey!
joey's hand twin| do i know you?
joey|  joey!
joey's hand twin| oh-ho, yeah. yeah, the hand guy.
joey| okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!

chandler| here it is! here it is!
monica| that could be a four or a five. it's your call.

the lurker| i don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair! (they start smacking each other's cups, but phoebe notices a security guard approaching.)
