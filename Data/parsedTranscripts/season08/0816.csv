joey| there’s this woman, that i like.  a lot.  well, it’s complicated.  she’s with this other guy.  for a long time.  and i could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’ccause we’re really good friends. 
ross| so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy? 
joey| yeah, he’s the best. 
ross| then talk to him! he might be fine with it. 
joey| oh, i don’t know. 
ross| joey, it’s worth finding out. i mean, if you really like her. 
joey| i do! so much! i can’t stop thinking about her! i can’t sleep, i— 
ross| okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself.  
joey| it’s rachel. 
ross|  did you um—i’m sorry, did you just say it’s rachel?
joey| yes.
ross| um, you…you like rachel?
joey| yes. i like rachel.
ross| rachel?!
joey|  yeah, okay but look, buy uh—hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else i like? you! and it-it doesn’t get said enough. i like you ross.
ross| but r-r-rachel-rachel?! 
joey| yeah, but it’s not a big deal.
ross| it’s not a big deal? oh, i’m sorry i just…um, i…what about all the stuff you-you just said? i mean how about, i like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. like how you can’t sleep?
joey| i’m an actor, y’know? as-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
ross| rachel who’s carrying my baby? rachel?
joey| look no, i-i know it’s bad, and i know it’s wrong. okay? but-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. y’know? these-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.
ross| y’know what? i-i gotta go. 
joey| oh come on ross! hey ross-ross don’t…
ross|"  i just—y’know—i-i just have one—rachel?!  (he exits and starts to walk away, passes a window, stops, and says ""rachel?!"" again. joey sighs and turns around to face gunther.)"
gunther| rachel?!! opening credits 
rachel| oh-oh! okay, she’s kicking!
chandler| oh!  she’s growing inside you.
rachel| whoa!!
chandler| oh! 
rachel| wow that was a big one.
chandler| i think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
phoebe|  oh hey you guys!
chandler| oh hey!
rachel| hi!
phoebe| hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
rachel| oh yes i do. i do. i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. and do you know how you find him? you stop looking for him. that’s why i stopped looking for russell crowe. he’ll find me.
phoebe| uh-huh,  and you?
chandler| no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i don’t think they exist.
phoebe| okay, good.
chandler| why?
phoebe| well last night, i met monica’s.
chandler| what?
phoebe| yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half.
chandler| come on, don’t be crazy.  you don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for monica than me, do ya? (rachel looks at him.)
rachel|  well, what’s he like?!
phoebe| well he’s tall.
rachel| uh-huh.
phoebe| he has brown hair.
rachel| of course, of course.
chandler| a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
phoebe| he works with food!
rachel| oh sure. older?
phoebe| obviously, and he’s british.
rachel| oh, i was just gonna ask!
phoebe| yeah? and, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
rachel| oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.
chandler| luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
phoebe| oh, i’m so sorry. um, and maybe i’m wrong! i but—y’know i’m gonna go out with him again, i’ll find out more.
chandler| you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
phoebe| well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat. 
monica| hey.
ross| hey.
monica| i just talked to joey, i just—i want to see how you were.
ross| oh y’know, i still—i can’t believe it. joey and rachel i mean it’s… it’s like you and me going out, only weirder!
monica| all right, i know you’re hurting, and-and i want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.
ross| oh my god! what if, what if they get married? then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
monica| honey, i don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! first of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. and even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.
ross| sure, because women never like joey. y’know, i think he’s a virgin.
monica| joey…he’s not even thinking about going after rachel!
ross| he’s not?
monica| no! all he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! i mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. he’s talking about moving to vermont.
ross| why?
monica| he says he wants to leave the country.  he thinks you hate him.
ross| hate him? i… no, i don’t hate him.  it’s just it’s rachel, y’know?
monica| honey i can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. but, i don’t want you to lose joey over it. and right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.
ross| okay. okay, i’ll talk to him.
monica| all right. now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money.  
phoebe| oh! hi!
monica| hi!
phoebe| umm, chandler, monica, this is don.
don| oh, hello.  hello. (shakes monica’s hand.)
phoebe|  soul mate.
chandler|  what?
phoebe|  soul mate.
monica| so, what have you guys been doing?
don| well, we just had a terrible lunch today at reattica. what is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
monica| i know! what is this, 1985?!
don| that’s exactly what i said. phoebe, isn’t that strange.
monica| not really.
chandler| what’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  on a barbecue chicken pizza?  no?
monica| so don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
don| well, octavio, 27&7—oh! and there’s this great little place, alessandro’s.
monica| oh my god! that’s my restaurant, i’m the chef there.
don| you’re kidding me!
monica| no!
don| your food is fantastic! wow, i really want to talk to you about your menu, once i get some coffees first. um, anyone want any?
monica| oh, i’d like a latte. oh y’know what? if you’re gonna talk about me, i’m gonna go with you.  
chandler| what are you doing?!
phoebe| nothing! i swear to god i didn’t know you guys would be here! and the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. so…
chandler| i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
phoebe| they’re just talking, and y’know what? just because i think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.
monica|  phoebe, good work.
phoebe| yeah?
monica| yeah! oh he’s great, i love him. (walks away and chandler glares at phoebe.)
phoebe| don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.  
joey| hey.
ross| hey.
joey| look, i understand if you came by to hit me, i deserve it.
ross| no, i don’t want to hit you.
joey| oh what then? kick me?
ross| no.
joey|  bite me?
ross| no, no i don’t want to do anything to you. all right? i just want to tell you that i’m not mad at you and…and that i certainly do not hate you. i just, i just came here to say that. 
joey| oh now—hey ross-ross! do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
ross| uh…yeah sure. 
joey| do uh, do you got any beer? all-all i got is this melon stuff that rachel left. i don’t…
ross| okay.
joey|  hey look ross, you need to understand something okay? i uh…i am never gonna act on this rachel thing, okay? i-i would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. 
ross| thank you. (they clink glasses and take a drink. ross likes it, joey hates it. then ross sees joey hating it, mimics he hates it as well.)
joey| anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. i’m not even sure how to do that, i mean i’ve never been in love before so…
ross| what?! you’re in love with her.
joey| yeah, i thought you knew that.
ross| umm, no.
joey|" wow. hey look, if it helps, i don’t want to feel this way. honest. i just keep thinking, ""ah, i’ll get over this."" y’know? i just—it just keeps gettin’ harder. i don’t, i don’t know what to do. y’know? what do i do? "
ross| i think you need to tell her how you feel.
joey| okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.
ross| no, i’m serious. you-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
joey| but what if uh—and i’m not saying she will be—but…
ross| if she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
joey| are you sure?
ross| yeah. look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. so…
joey| hey thanks.
ross| so when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
joey| oh my god i have to tell her! i haven’t even thought about what i will say. what should i say?
ross| i’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.
joey| i’m sorry, you’re right. what am i gonna say? (he takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) oh!
ross| yeah, tell me about it. (he stands up, turns his back to joey, and enjoys another sip.) commercial break 
don| …so i’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
chandler| cheese you say? that’s some pretty smelly work, huh don?
don| excuse me?
chandler| cheese, it’s smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too.
don| uh, not really. but when it comes to cheese, i’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
monica| me too! yeah, chandler can’t stand it. he won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
don| and you’re still married to him? (they both laugh, and chandler tries to but fails.)
monica| you know what i’d love to do? i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheese—not even bread, just cheese. no, i want the bread. yeah. ah, and pastries…  and pate. oh, i’m really not high, it’s just i used to be fat.
don| well if you where ever enter the loire valley let me know, i’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.
chandler| is it made of cheese?
don| no. but god, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!
monica| i’d move in tomorrow!
chandler|  are you listening to this?
phoebe| i’m so sorry.
chandler| what do we do?
phoebe| i don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! i don’t know how you fight that. 
joey| okay. okay, i can do this. i can tell her how i feel. just uh, just stand up straight.  look confident. (does so as rachel opens the door and startles him.)
rachel| joey? what’s up?
joey| i uh, i just came by because i-i want to talk to you about something.
rachel| okay what’s up?
joey| here? in the hall? what are we animals?
rachel| well honey, i’m late for a meeting. so can you just make it quick?
joey| okay umm, i just came by to tell you that i…want to have dinner with you tonight. that’s all.
rachel| sure! that sounds great! just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. okay? 
joey| okay. that’s good. okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. good. yeah. (someone comes out of his apartment and it startles joey again.) don’t you people ever knock?! 
monica| i’d like to have don and phoebe over. wouldn’t that be nice?
chandler| sure, why don’t you set it up. i’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
monica| are you okay? you’ve been acting weird all afternoon.
chandler| yeah, fine. fine. not perfect!! but good enough.
monica| jeez! what is with you?
chandler| i’m sorry, did you say cheese?
monica| all right, what’s going on?
chandler| phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates, and i don’t believe in that kind of stuff. but then you two totally get along. so look, i won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese.
monica| chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?
chandler| no. but i’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.
monica| i don’t believe in soul mates either.
chandler| you don’t?
monica| no. i don’t think that you and i were destined to end up together. i think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. some days we work really hard.
chandler| so you…you don’t want to live with don in a cheese house?
monica| no, i’ve had second thoughts about that. do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
chandler| i love you.
monica| i know.
chandler| y’know what? i am going to take you out to dinner tonight. i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (monica doesn’t look impressed.) no? really? they taste so good. 
rachel| …and i know chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. i mean i’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  are you okay?
joey| what? yeah! sure! uh, look at the uh, the reason…(exhales slowly)—is it hot in here?
rachel| no. not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?
joey| i would, but this is a nice place and my t-shirt has a picture of calvin doing hobbs.
rachel| oh my god! really?! can i see it?
joey| yeah. sure. (they both half stand up, joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and rachel looks down it to see his t-shirt.)
rachel| huh. wow, i wouldn’t think hobbs would like that so much.
joey| uh… how long have we known each other?
rachel| um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. wow.
joey| uh-huh, long time.
rachel| yeah.
joey| but over the past few weeks… 
waiter| hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! we have a couple specials tonight…
joey| actually uh, could you give us a second?
waiter| sure. sure.  second’s up! (joey glares at him.) not…that kind of table. 
rachel| so you were saying?
joey| i’m not quite sure.
rachel|" okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and i said, ""eight years."" and the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are."
joey| yeah, here we are. uhh… i… i think i’m…falling in love with you.
rachel|  what?
joey| i’m falling in love with you.
rachel|  who are you talking too? oh, you’re kidding! oh, it’s a joke!  it’s funny. it’s funny. i don’t get it. (joey doesn’t say any thing and rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) oh.  okay. umm… i-i…uh, wow. are you uh… how did umm… when?
joey| does it really matter?
rachel| wow! wow. wow. wow, it is hot in here.
joey| okay look rach, i know this is a lot. you don’t have to say anything. you-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  okay, you gotta say something!
rachel| joey, joey i love you so much, but i…
joey| but. 
rachel| joey.
joey| yeah-yeah right. that’s okay. that’s fine. that’s uh, pretty much what i was expecting. so uh, it’s no big deal. all right? i think i’m gonna go. 
rachel| no! joey please! please don’t! please don’t leave like this! now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! 
joey| don’t start doing that. you can’t do that rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that.  oh, here we go! (sits down next to her.)
rachel| can i? 
joey| sure!  
rachel| oh joey honey i don’t…i don’t want to lose…
joey| hey-hey-hey, hey! you can’t. okay? ever!
rachel| i’m so sorry.
joey| oh no-no rach, please, don’t be sorry. okay? don’t be sorry.  y’know i was only kidding you.
rachel| yeah, that was a real good one. closing credits
