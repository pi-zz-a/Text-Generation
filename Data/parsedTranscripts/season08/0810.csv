monica: hey! so what do you think?
chandler: new haircut?  boots?  boots!
monica: yes! now, they’re a little more than i normally spend on boots…or rent 
chandler: oh my god!
monica: i know.
chandler: i’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
monica:" i’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! and the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""oh, these are way too expensive for you."""
chandler: she had a point.  
rachel:  hi!
monica: hey.
rachel: oh my god!  oh monica! those boots are amazing!
monica: they’re mine!
chandler: yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.
rachel: return them?! shh! they’re gonna hear you!
monica: honey, i’m not returning them. okay? i mean i-i know they cost a lot, but i’m going to wear them all the time. you’ll see. besides, i love the compliments. i mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
chandler: i have you.
monica: nice try; i’m keeping the boots. opening credits  
ross: that’s right, i love you! and-and i’m gonna play with you all the time.
phoebe: how can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
rachel:  he’s talking to the baby.
phoebe:" ohh! okay! okay, cause when-when he said, ""i can’t wait to hear your first words,"" i thought, ""there’s a trick."""
rachel: okay. well, i gotta go you guys. i’ll see you later.
phoebe: okay.
ross: bye.
rachel: bye. 
joey: oh hey rach, listen—hi!
rachel: hi.
joey: umm, can you do me a favor? i was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at ralph lauren…
rachel: no, forget it! no way! i am not sending anymore ralph lauren clothes to prison. it is a waste.
joey: no-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. my youngest sister, dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.
rachel: i guess i can talk to one of my supervisors…
joey: oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
rachel: really?! oh my god! i’m successful!
joey: okay, so will you meet with her?
rachel: yes! i’d love to! have her come by the office.
joey: great! thanks! you’re gonna love her so much. and—oh, she’s the smartest of all the tribbiani children. hey, y’know the s.a.t’s?
rachel: yeah.
joey: she took ‘em! (joey goes to get coffee and rachel exits as the camera pans to phoebe and ross on the couch.)
phoebe: hey ross! doesn’t ben go to the smithfield day school?
ross: yeah. why?
phoebe: sting has a son that goes there too!
ross: yeah i know; he’s in ben’s class.
phoebe: you knew this and you never said anything?! with all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
ross: fine! no more dinosaur stuff! can i talk about fossils? (joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
phoebe: sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.
ross: what are you reading? the kidnappers guide to manhattan private schools?
phoebe: no, it’s new york magazine. it’s an article about the best schools in the city. so how well do you know sting?
ross: uh, i actually haven’t even met him.
phoebe: uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. i really want to go to his concert friday night, but it’s totally sold out. i know! why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! if you get two i’ll take you.
ross: well actually, i’m picking ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.
phoebe: there you go! oh, you are so lucky! you might actually get to meet sting tomorrow! that’s why you have kids!  
monica: hey guys!
chandler: hey-hey.
rachel: hi monica!
monica: hey. 
rachel: hi boots.
monica: see chandler? i’m getting a lot of use out of them already! they’re very practical. see, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…
chandler: you can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. 
phoebe: wow! they’re beautiful!
rachel: ahh…
monica:  they hurt so much!
phoebe: what?!
monica: the guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
rachel: well-well you can give them to me! i haven’t felt my feet in years!
monica: i can’t! i spent so much money on them and i told chandler that i’d wear them all the time, i just can’t give them away!
phoebe: well then get your money back and return them!
monica: i can’t do that either! the soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
ross:  hey!
chandler:  hey!
ross: hey i uh just picked up ben from school…
chandler:  i don’t think you did a very thorough job!
ross: i dropped him off at carol’s.  anyway, it turns out that i’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.
phoebe: oh no! why not?
ross: well it turns out that ben and sting’s son do not get along.
phoebe: how come?!
ross: apparently, sting’s son made fun of the fact that ben’s moms are lesbinims.
phoebe: wait! but ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. make them be friends.
ross: phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.
phoebe: sure you can! give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
ross: playpen?! ben’s seven!
phoebe: your kid is seven?!  he’s really small.  please! please get the tickets!
ross: look i’m sorry pheebs, i can’t do it.
phoebe: yes you can! sting says so himself!
ross: what?
phoebe:  rosssss can!
ross: look phoebe, i’m sorry it’s just…
phoebe:  rossss can!
ross: phoebe, i…
phoebe:  rosss can! give me the tickets! ross can give me the tickets!!  
joey:  here she is! future fashion superstar!
rachel: oh joey, i’m hardly a…
joey: my little sister dina!
rachel: right! hi dina! 
dina: hi.
rachel: nice to meet you. 
dina: thanks so much for meetin’ with me. joey’s told me so much about you!
joey: this is so exciting for her. well, i’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business. 
rachel: okay. all right dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…
dina: i…i don’t care about fashion! i’m pregnant! and i know you are too, so you gotta help me!
rachel:  and there’s marketing…  on the step and changes from wearing tennis shoes to the boots and she moans in pain as 
monica:  ahhhhhhhh!
chandler:  what’s wrong?
monica: oh nothing i’m just—just was yawning. (mimics the groan from before and stretches.)
chandler: oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (they go into the apartment.)
monica: honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
chandler: now sweetie, i know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. see? every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
monica: i-i don’t-i don’t think that i’m gonna wear the boots tonight.
chandler: why not?
monica: well y’know, i’m just-i’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. or! or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
chandler: do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company?
monica: anyway, i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.
chandler: you said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
monica: fine! if you want me to wear the boots, i’ll wear the boots. in fact, i’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.
chandler: okay.
monica: okay?  ooo wee! christmas party in my boots! (runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ with laughing.)  
dina: i-i can’t go in there. i can’t tell him!
rachel: honey, it’s going to be okay. he’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (she gives dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
dina: thank you.
rachel: okay. 
joey: hey! it’s my fashion girls!  what’s wrong?
rachel: honey, why don’t you sit down? dina has something that she wants to tell you.
joey:  oh. what’s, what’s going on? is it mom? is she sick? is it dad’s heart? is that a sandwich?
dina: joe, mom and dad are fine…
joey: is that a sandwich?!
rachel: joey…there’s something that you…should know. dina?
dina: i’m pregnant.
joey:  what?!
rachel:  now! give him the sandwich! give him the sandwich! (she quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
joey: well obviously this is a mistake! you can’t be pregnant! because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
dina: joe, i tried to wait until i was 25 like you did!
rachel: what?! dina…
joey:  i can’t believe this! you’re the good one! you went to college! both years! who did this to you?!
dina: bobby corso, but he’s a real nice guy. i like him a lot. he’s real funny.
joey: you got pregnant for funny?! dina…if he’s funny…laugh! all right, i’ll be back in a little while! you stay here!
dina: why? where are you going?
joey: i can’t look at you right now! 
dina: wow.
rachel: i know. (joey storms back in and covering his face so he doesn’t see dina grabs the sandwich and heads back out.) commercial break  
phoebe: oh, there you are ben!
ben: aunt phoebe, what are you doing here?
phoebe: well, i heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. and so i thought i would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. now umm, the boy’s name is sting’s son.
ben: jack? i hate him! he’s a jerk.
phoebe: now ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
ben: i have to go. my friend doug is waiting for me over there. (goes over to doug.)
phoebe: him you’re friends with. (starts looking at the children trying to find jack and a teacher notices her.)
the teacher: excuse me. can, can i help you with something?
phoebe: yes! yes you can, i’m looking for jack’s parents.
the teacher: are you with one of the students?
phoebe: uh-huh, i’m with ben.
the teacher: are you one of ben’s mothers?
phoebe: i am one of ben’s mothers. i’m a lesbian. it was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
the teacher: well hi, i’m jenny boone. i’m the new teacher here.
phoebe: oh.
the teacher: i’ve only met your partner carol.
phoebe: ah! okay so that would make me susan.
the teacher: right. are you looking for jack’s parents to discuss the problems he’s having with ben?  yeah. because i really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
phoebe: yeah! let’s do that!! that-that sounds good. we should sit down and talk, just me, my lover carol, and the stings. umm, how-how will i get in touch with them?
the teacher: oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
phoebe: uh-huh. uh-huh. umm, could-could i get a copy of that? ‘cause carol threw it out, she lost ours. she’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.  
chandler: y’know, that party wasn’t bad.
monica: yeah! i didn’t know there would be dancing. that was a fun surprise!
chandler: i don’t see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk?
monica: oh no, we can’t walk!
chandler: what honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. let’s go.
monica: hey! do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
chandler: what’s going on?
monica: i can’t walk. okay? okay? these boots were a huge mistake!
chandler: what?
monica: okay you were right! all right, i never should have bought them! they’re killing me! one toe at a time!
chandler: so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right.  it’s oddly unsettling.
monica: how are we gonna get home? maybe a piggy-back ride?
chandler: hop on.
monica: okay. wait, just give me a second, i need to just get my boots off first.  ah…ooh…oohh…ohh…oh god…ohh…oh…ohh…ohhhh…
chandler: honey, i know you’re in pain right now, but i’m a little turned on.  
dina: do you ever worry that you’ll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
rachel: what college was that dina? 
dina: oh my god! bobby!
bobby: hi dina. good to see you.
rachel: joey, what are you doing?
joey: just what needs to be done! dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…
rachel: oh joey this is crazy!
joey: don’t interrupt me when i’m talkin’ to god! now where were we? oh right, okay. do you dina, take this man…
dina: no!
joey: oh you’ll take ‘em!
dina: no i won’t!
joey: hey! you don’t get a say in this!
dina: yes i do!
joey:" ahhh! i heard ""i do"", we’re halfway there! okay!  you!"
rachel: all right joey! that is enough! (grabs him and pulls him away from bobby and dina) listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. okay? they-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
bobby: yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
joey: well what am i supposed to do?
rachel: you’re supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.
joey: no they can’t! they were stupid enough to get knocked up!
rachel: heyyyyy! contraceptives are not always effective!  right?
bobby: yeah…we kinda didn’t use any…
rachel: oh, come on kids! a little help here!  
phoebe: wow! this place is incredible!  sting’s pen…that he gave to phoebe.  come on! secret passageway! 
trudie styler: hi! 
phoebe: hi!
trudie styler: i’m trudie.
phoebe: uh-huh.
trudie styler: you must be ben’s mum.
phoebe: why else would i be here?
trudie styler: do sit down.
phoebe: uh-huh. 
trudie styler: i gather jack and ben haven’t been getting along lately.
phoebe: yeah.
trudie styler: i’m told there are two sides to this story, but all i’ve heard is that ben’s a bit of a poo-poo head.
phoebe: umm, i’m sorry. won’t-won’t jack’s father be joining us?
trudie styler: oh i’m sorry, jack’s father is not available.
phoebe: uh-hmm. okay. well then, could we reschedule? for say, friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?
trudie styler: oh no, i know that wouldn’t work. my husband’s in concert.
phoebe: concert. yeah. that does put us in…quite a pickle. because you see i’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.
trudie styler: so, i guess you and i should talk about jack and ben right now.
phoebe: unless! unless umm, okay i-i would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
trudie styler: are you here for tickets?
phoebe: oh, thank you. four would be great.
trudie styler: i’m not giving concert tickets to someone who’d use their son like this!
phoebe: oh good! then you’re in luck! ben’s not my son!
trudie styler:  look, i’ve just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. any minute now, the police will be here!
phoebe: the police? here? a reunion?!  
chandler: okay, ten blocks down. five to go.
monica:  oh wait! stop! stop! stop!
chandler: oh i’m sorry! do you need a break?
monica: my boots in tan! hey! can you get a little closer so i can see the price?
chandler: i can see it from right here. it’ll cost you one husband.
monica: okay, i’m sorry. i think i can walk the rest of the way now. just-just give me my boots.
chandler:  i don’t have your boots.
monica: well i don’t have them either. where are they?
chandler: well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay!
monica: okay.  god well, we gotta go back and get them!
chandler: honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
monica: okay, i’m never gonna wear them again. i just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.
chandler: y’know what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones.
monica: okay.  all right.
chandler: okay. 
monica:   
rachel: joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. maybe they have a plan!
joey: oh? oh! okay! okay! let’s hear their plan! now, what’s the future look like for dina and bobby?
bobby: well…i really have high hopes for my band.
joey:  you were right. he is funny.
rachel: hey, now wait a minute! i get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! now come on bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?
bobby: well it’s just me and my pal rooster, the band’s name is numb nuts.
rachel: 
joey: dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! even if it is to bobby!  dude, that’s not a compliment!
dina: no joey! i knew you wouldn’t be supportive!
joey: so whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! what are you gonna do? you’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! you can’t be a single mother alone! you’re gonna ruin your life!
rachel: oh excuse me! am i ruining my life?
joey: no! no! no! it’s different for you. you’re so strong and together. you’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.
dina: excuse me?
joey: one pregnant woman at a time, please! i just want you to be okay.
rachel: so forcing her to marry bobby is gonna make that happen?
joey: maybe!  well! well…so-so uh, what kind of music does numb nuts—oh forget it! i can’t!
dina: joey, i am scared to death about this. but i really think i can do it, i’m just gonna need some help. and bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.
bobby: you bet i am!  and to answer your earlier question, we’re straight-up gangster rap. 
dina: look, rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. why can’t you do that for me?
joey: because! ‘cause… ‘cause you’re my baby sister!
dina: and you’re my big brother! i mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world. i’m not even scared to tell mom and dad. i was scared of telling you.
joey: well i’d be scared of them, but all right.
dina: joey, i can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. i want him to have his uncle. is my baby gonna have his uncle joey?
joey: of course he’s gonna have his uncle joey!
dina: we’re gonna be all right. i mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. not just by us.
joey: that’s right! by his uncle too!
bobby: and by you.
rachel: okay bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. 
joey: come here! 
rachel: no! seriously! what’s wrong with you?! closing credits 
ross: you’re gonna love me so much. i got sting tickets!! 
phoebe: oh my god! i do love you! how did you do it?!
ross: well…let’s just say…  rosss caaaaan!
phoebe: oo, where are the seats?
ross: uh, middle balcony.
phoebe: okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
ross: yeah.
