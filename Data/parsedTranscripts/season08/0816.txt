JOEY:
 there’s this woman, that i like.  a lot.  well, it’s complicated.  she’s with this other guy.  for a long time.  and i could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’ccause we’re really good friends. 

ROSS:
 so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy? 

JOEY:
 yeah, he’s the best. 

ROSS:
 then talk to him! he might be fine with it. 

JOEY:
 oh, i don’t know. 

ROSS:
 joey, it’s worth finding out. i mean, if you really like her. 

JOEY:
 i do! so much! i can’t stop thinking about her! i can’t sleep, i— 

ROSS:
 okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself.  

JOEY:
 it’s rachel. 

ROSS:
  did you um—i’m sorry, did you just say it’s rachel?

JOEY:
 yes.

ROSS:
 um, you…you like rachel?

JOEY:
 yes. i like rachel.

ROSS:
 rachel?!

JOEY:
  yeah, okay but look, buy uh—hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else i like? you! and it-it doesn’t get said enough. i like you ross.

ROSS:
 but r-r-rachel-rachel?! 

JOEY:
 yeah, but it’s not a big deal.

ROSS:
 it’s not a big deal? oh, i’m sorry i just…um, i…what about all the stuff you-you just said? i mean how about, i like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. like how you can’t sleep?

JOEY:
 i’m an actor, y’know? as-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.

ROSS:
 rachel who’s carrying my baby? rachel?

JOEY:
 look no, i-i know it’s bad, and i know it’s wrong. okay? but-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. y’know? these-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.

ROSS:
 y’know what? i-i gotta go. 

JOEY:
 oh come on ross! hey ross-ross don’t…

ROSS:
  i just—y’know—i-i just have one—rachel?!  (he exits and starts to walk away, passes a window, stops, and says "rachel?!" again. joey sighs and turns around to face gunther.)

GUNTHER:
 rachel?!! opening credits 

RACHEL:
 oh-oh! okay, she’s kicking!

CHANDLER:
 oh!  she’s growing inside you.

RACHEL:
 whoa!!

CHANDLER:
 oh! 

RACHEL:
 wow that was a big one.

CHANDLER:
 i think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.

PHOEBE:
  oh hey you guys!

CHANDLER:
 oh hey!

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?

RACHEL:
 oh yes i do. i do. i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. and do you know how you find him? you stop looking for him. that’s why i stopped looking for russell crowe. he’ll find me.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh,  and you?

CHANDLER:
 no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i don’t think they exist.

PHOEBE:
 okay, good.

CHANDLER:
 why?

PHOEBE:
 well last night, i met monica’s.

CHANDLER:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half.

CHANDLER:
 come on, don’t be crazy.  you don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for monica than me, do ya? (rachel looks at him.)

RACHEL:
  well, what’s he like?!

PHOEBE:
 well he’s tall.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.

PHOEBE:
 he has brown hair.

RACHEL:
 of course, of course.

CHANDLER:
 a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!

PHOEBE:
 he works with food!

RACHEL:
 oh sure. older?

PHOEBE:
 obviously, and he’s british.

RACHEL:
 oh, i was just gonna ask!

PHOEBE:
 yeah? and, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.

RACHEL:
 oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.

CHANDLER:
 luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i’m so sorry. um, and maybe i’m wrong! i but—y’know i’m gonna go out with him again, i’ll find out more.

CHANDLER:
 you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?

PHOEBE:
 well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat. 

MONICA:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey.

MONICA:
 i just talked to joey, i just—i want to see how you were.

ROSS:
 oh y’know, i still—i can’t believe it. joey and rachel i mean it’s… it’s like you and me going out, only weirder!

MONICA:
 all right, i know you’re hurting, and-and i want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.

ROSS:
 oh my god! what if, what if they get married? then he’d be the stepfather of my child.

MONICA:
 honey, i don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! first of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. and even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.

ROSS:
 sure, because women never like joey. y’know, i think he’s a virgin.

MONICA:
 joey…he’s not even thinking about going after rachel!

ROSS:
 he’s not?

MONICA:
 no! all he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! i mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. he’s talking about moving to vermont.

ROSS:
 why?

MONICA:
 he says he wants to leave the country.  he thinks you hate him.

ROSS:
 hate him? i… no, i don’t hate him.  it’s just it’s rachel, y’know?

MONICA:
 honey i can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. but, i don’t want you to lose joey over it. and right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.

ROSS:
 okay. okay, i’ll talk to him.

MONICA:
 all right. now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money.  

PHOEBE:
 oh! hi!

MONICA:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 umm, chandler, monica, this is don.

DON:
 oh, hello.  hello. (shakes monica’s hand.)

PHOEBE:
  soul mate.

CHANDLER:
  what?

PHOEBE:
  soul mate.

MONICA:
 so, what have you guys been doing?

DON:
 well, we just had a terrible lunch today at reattica. what is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?

MONICA:
 i know! what is this, 1985?!

DON:
 that’s exactly what i said. phoebe, isn’t that strange.

MONICA:
 not really.

CHANDLER:
 what’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  on a barbecue chicken pizza?  no?

MONICA:
 so don, what-what other restaurants do you like?

DON:
 well, octavio, 27&7—oh! and there’s this great little place, alessandro’s.

MONICA:
 oh my god! that’s my restaurant, i’m the chef there.

DON:
 you’re kidding me!

MONICA:
 no!

DON:
 your food is fantastic! wow, i really want to talk to you about your menu, once i get some coffees first. um, anyone want any?

MONICA:
 oh, i’d like a latte. oh y’know what? if you’re gonna talk about me, i’m gonna go with you.  

CHANDLER:
 what are you doing?!

PHOEBE:
 nothing! i swear to god i didn’t know you guys would be here! and the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. so…

CHANDLER:
 i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!

PHOEBE:
 they’re just talking, and y’know what? just because i think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.

MONICA:
  phoebe, good work.

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 yeah! oh he’s great, i love him. (walks away and chandler glares at phoebe.)

PHOEBE:
 don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.  

JOEY:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey.

JOEY:
 look, i understand if you came by to hit me, i deserve it.

ROSS:
 no, i don’t want to hit you.

JOEY:
 oh what then? kick me?

ROSS:
 no.

JOEY:
  bite me?

ROSS:
 no, no i don’t want to do anything to you. all right? i just want to tell you that i’m not mad at you and…and that i certainly do not hate you. i just, i just came here to say that. 

JOEY:
 oh now—hey ross-ross! do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?

ROSS:
 uh…yeah sure. 

JOEY:
 do uh, do you got any beer? all-all i got is this melon stuff that rachel left. i don’t…

ROSS:
 okay.

JOEY:
  hey look ross, you need to understand something okay? i uh…i am never gonna act on this rachel thing, okay? i-i would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. 

ROSS:
 thank you. (they clink glasses and take a drink. ross likes it, joey hates it. then ross sees joey hating it, mimics he hates it as well.)

JOEY:
 anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. i’m not even sure how to do that, i mean i’ve never been in love before so…

ROSS:
 what?! you’re in love with her.

JOEY:
 yeah, i thought you knew that.

ROSS:
 umm, no.

JOEY:
 wow. hey look, if it helps, i don’t want to feel this way. honest. i just keep thinking, "ah, i’ll get over this." y’know? i just—it just keeps gettin’ harder. i don’t, i don’t know what to do. y’know? what do i do? 

ROSS:
 i think you need to tell her how you feel.

JOEY:
 okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.

ROSS:
 no, i’m serious. you-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.

JOEY:
 but what if uh—and i’m not saying she will be—but…

ROSS:
 if she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.

JOEY:
 are you sure?

ROSS:
 yeah. look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. so…

JOEY:
 hey thanks.

ROSS:
 so when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?

JOEY:
 oh my god i have to tell her! i haven’t even thought about what i will say. what should i say?

ROSS:
 i’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.

JOEY:
 i’m sorry, you’re right. what am i gonna say? (he takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) oh!

ROSS:
 yeah, tell me about it. (he stands up, turns his back to joey, and enjoys another sip.) commercial break 

DON:
 …so i’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.

CHANDLER:
 cheese you say? that’s some pretty smelly work, huh don?

DON:
 excuse me?

CHANDLER:
 cheese, it’s smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too.

DON:
 uh, not really. but when it comes to cheese, i’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.

MONICA:
 me too! yeah, chandler can’t stand it. he won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.

DON:
 and you’re still married to him? (they both laugh, and chandler tries to but fails.)

MONICA:
 you know what i’d love to do? i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheese—not even bread, just cheese. no, i want the bread. yeah. ah, and pastries…  and pate. oh, i’m really not high, it’s just i used to be fat.

DON:
 well if you where ever enter the loire valley let me know, i’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.

CHANDLER:
 is it made of cheese?

DON:
 no. but god, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!

MONICA:
 i’d move in tomorrow!

CHANDLER:
  are you listening to this?

PHOEBE:
 i’m so sorry.

CHANDLER:
 what do we do?

PHOEBE:
 i don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! i don’t know how you fight that. 

JOEY:
 okay. okay, i can do this. i can tell her how i feel. just uh, just stand up straight.  look confident. (does so as rachel opens the door and startles him.)

RACHEL:
 joey? what’s up?

JOEY:
 i uh, i just came by because i-i want to talk to you about something.

RACHEL:
 okay what’s up?

JOEY:
 here? in the hall? what are we animals?

RACHEL:
 well honey, i’m late for a meeting. so can you just make it quick?

JOEY:
 okay umm, i just came by to tell you that i…want to have dinner with you tonight. that’s all.

RACHEL:
 sure! that sounds great! just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. okay? 

JOEY:
 okay. that’s good. okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. good. yeah. (someone comes out of his apartment and it startles joey again.) don’t you people ever knock?! 

MONICA:
 i’d like to have don and phoebe over. wouldn’t that be nice?

CHANDLER:
 sure, why don’t you set it up. i’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.

MONICA:
 are you okay? you’ve been acting weird all afternoon.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, fine. fine. not perfect!! but good enough.

MONICA:
 jeez! what is with you?

CHANDLER:
 i’m sorry, did you say cheese?

MONICA:
 all right, what’s going on?

CHANDLER:
 phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates, and i don’t believe in that kind of stuff. but then you two totally get along. so look, i won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese.

MONICA:
 chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?

CHANDLER:
 no. but i’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.

MONICA:
 i don’t believe in soul mates either.

CHANDLER:
 you don’t?

MONICA:
 no. i don’t think that you and i were destined to end up together. i think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. some days we work really hard.

CHANDLER:
 so you…you don’t want to live with don in a cheese house?

MONICA:
 no, i’ve had second thoughts about that. do you realize how hard that would be to clean?

CHANDLER:
 i love you.

MONICA:
 i know.

CHANDLER:
 y’know what? i am going to take you out to dinner tonight. i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (monica doesn’t look impressed.) no? really? they taste so good. 

RACHEL:
 …and i know chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. i mean i’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  are you okay?

JOEY:
 what? yeah! sure! uh, look at the uh, the reason…(exhales slowly)—is it hot in here?

RACHEL:
 no. not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?

JOEY:
 i would, but this is a nice place and my t-shirt has a picture of calvin doing hobbs.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! really?! can i see it?

JOEY:
 yeah. sure. (they both half stand up, joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and rachel looks down it to see his t-shirt.)

RACHEL:
 huh. wow, i wouldn’t think hobbs would like that so much.

JOEY:
 uh… how long have we known each other?

RACHEL:
 um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. wow.

JOEY:
 uh-huh, long time.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 but over the past few weeks… 

WAITER:
 hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! we have a couple specials tonight…

JOEY:
 actually uh, could you give us a second?

WAITER:
 sure. sure.  second’s up! (joey glares at him.) not…that kind of table. 

RACHEL:
 so you were saying?

JOEY:
 i’m not quite sure.

RACHEL:
 okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and i said, "eight years." and the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.

JOEY:
 yeah, here we are. uhh… i… i think i’m…falling in love with you.

RACHEL:
  what?

JOEY:
 i’m falling in love with you.

RACHEL:
  who are you talking too? oh, you’re kidding! oh, it’s a joke!  it’s funny. it’s funny. i don’t get it. (joey doesn’t say any thing and rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) oh.  okay. umm… i-i…uh, wow. are you uh… how did umm… when?

JOEY:
 does it really matter?

RACHEL:
 wow! wow. wow. wow, it is hot in here.

JOEY:
 okay look rach, i know this is a lot. you don’t have to say anything. you-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  okay, you gotta say something!

RACHEL:
 joey, joey i love you so much, but i…

JOEY:
 but. 

RACHEL:
 joey.

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah right. that’s okay. that’s fine. that’s uh, pretty much what i was expecting. so uh, it’s no big deal. all right? i think i’m gonna go. 

RACHEL:
 no! joey please! please don’t! please don’t leave like this! now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! 

JOEY:
 don’t start doing that. you can’t do that rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that.  oh, here we go! (sits down next to her.)

RACHEL:
 can i? 

JOEY:
 sure!  

RACHEL:
 oh joey honey i don’t…i don’t want to lose…

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey, hey! you can’t. okay? ever!

RACHEL:
 i’m so sorry.

JOEY:
 oh no-no rach, please, don’t be sorry. okay? don’t be sorry.  y’know i was only kidding you.

RACHEL:
 yeah, that was a real good one. closing credits
