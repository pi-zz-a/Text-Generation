MONICA:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 yeah. yeah, i think i will.

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—ooh-ooh, leatherface from the texas chainsaw massacre—no-no-no! slutty leatherface.

PHOEBE:
 now wasn’t joey hitting on her at the wedding too?

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

URSULA:

PHOEBE:

URSULA:

PHOEBE:
   

RACHEL:
 hi!

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 oh. 

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 okay. 

KIDS:

RACHEL:
 oh! oh! can i give out the candy? i really want to be with the kids right now. y’know, ever since i got pregnant i-i have the strongest maternal instincts.

KIDS:
 trick or treat!!

RACHEL:
  just a minute!!! (she takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) look at you guys! wow! you are a very scary witch. 

WITCH:
 thank you.

RACHEL:
 and you are a very funny clown. 

CLOWN:
 thank you.

RACHEL:
  and you are so in style right now. y’know, i work at ralph lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. i don’t suppose you saw the cover of british vogue, but…

COWGIRL:
  can i just have the candy?

RACHEL:
 yeah. sure. (throws some in her bag and she walks away as phoebe, dressed as supergirl walks up and eyes monica who eyes her back.)

PHOEBE:
 ah, catwoman. so we meet again.

MONICA:
 so we do supergirl.

PHOEBE:
 no, it’s me. phoebe!

CHANDLER:
  monica! can i talk to you for a second? listen, i appreciate you getting me the costume…

RACHEL:
  oh, you did this to him?

MONICA:
 what?! i thought he’d love it! his favorite kid's book was the velveteen rabbit!

CHANDLER:
 the velveteen rabbit was brown and white!

MONICA:
 well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.

CHANDLER:
 no bunny at all!! always no bunny at all!!!

JOEY:
  hey!

MONICA:
 you didn’t dress up either?!

JOEY:
 yes i did! i’m chandler.  dude, what happened?

CHANDLER:
 how is that me?

JOEY:
 okay. i’m chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)

PHOEBE:
  that is so you!

CHANDLER:
 when have i ever done that?!

JOEY:
 when have i ever done that?!  

GIRL:
 trick or treat!

RACHEL:
 oh!  well you’re just the prettiest ballerina i’ve ever seen.

BALLERINA:
 thank you. 

RACHEL:
 oh wow! that deserves another piece of candy.

BALLERINA:
 thank you. 

RACHEL:
 well, i have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.

BALLERINA:
 i love you! 

RACHEL:
 ohh… oh, honey here. take it all. (pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) monica! we need more candy?

MONICA:
 what?! there’s only been like four kids.

RACHEL:
 yeah i know, but one of them just said that she loved me so i just gave her everything.

PHOEBE:
 no wonder your pregnant.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hey.

MONICA:
 what are you supposed to be?

ROSS:
 remember the russian satellite, sputnik?  well, i’m a potato or a…spud. and these are my antennae. (points to the colander with an old tv antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) so sputnik, becomes…  spud-nik. spudnik!

CHANDLER:
 wow! i don’t have the worst costume anymore!

JOEY:
  hey all right, ross came as doody.

ROSS:
 no, i-i’m not doody.

MONICA:
 no, space doody! (joey gives him the okay symbol, and ross rushes towards him to be stopped by chandler. meanwhile, phoebe goes over to the snack table as some guy, which turns out to be ursula's fiancée eric, walks in and smacks her butt.)

ERIC:
 aren’t you gonna give me a kiss?

PHOEBE:
 okay, i will. but right after you tell me who the hell you are.

ERIC:
 ursula?

PHOEBE:
 ursula’s fiancée?

ERIC:
 oh my god, you’re the sister!

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

ERIC:
 okay, i just slapped my future sister-in-law’s ass.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

ERIC:
 i’m an idiot. uh, is your mother here? maybe i can give her a little slap on the butt.

PHOEBE:
 my mother killed herself.

ERIC:
 she, now i knew that and…now i’m sweating. look at me, i’m really sweating—now i’m saying, "look at me," i’m getting even sweatier. i think i probably should go.

PHOEBE:
 no-no! that’s okay, we’ll just start over. okay? hi! i’m phoebe.

ERIC:
 eric. (they shake hands and he’s squinting. and, no, it’s not me.)

PHOEBE:
 why are you looking at me like that?

ERIC:
 ‘cause the sweat’s getting in my eyes and its burning.

PHOEBE:
 okay.  so, what are you?

ERIC:
 i don’t think they have a name for it. it’s just i get nervous; i start sweating like crazy.

PHOEBE:
  no i-i meant your costume.

ERIC:
 oh umm, i’m the solar system. (he’s wearing a black sweater with the planets glued on around the sun.) yeah, my students helped me make it—i teach the second grade.

PHOEBE:
 i love the second grade!

ERIC:
 really?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! it’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. y’know with all the politics and mind games.

ERIC:
 so what do you do?

PHOEBE:
 umm, i’m a masseuse…by day. (stands with her hands on her hips like a supergirl pose.)

ERIC:
 y’know you don’t have to stand here with me, believe me…

PHOEBE:
 no i’m having fun. i’m really—and i’m really-really excited for you and ursula.

ERIC:
 oh i feel very lucky, she’s great. i think she’s the most beautiful woman i’ve ever seen.

PHOEBE:
 thank you. 

MONICA:
 hey joey?

JOEY:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 you read comic books right?

JOEY:
 exclusively.

MONICA:
 who do you think would win in a fight, catwoman or supergirl?

JOEY:
 catwoman, hands down.

MONICA:
 yeah…

JOEY:
 but between you and phoebe, i’d have to give the edge to phoebe.

MONICA:
 what?! really?!

JOEY:
 are you kiddin’? phoebe lived on the street. okay? plus, she’s got this crazy temper. she—she’s not standing right behind me is she?

MONICA:
 no you’re fine.  all right well, do you think i could take rachel?

JOEY:
 i’m not sure.

MONICA:
 what?! come on i am tough! punch me right here!  as hard as you can!

JOEY:
 will you relax?! what are you taking this so seriously for? it doesn’t matter.

MONICA:
 oh really? okay? well what would you say if i told you that, y’know, ross or chandler could beat you up?

JOEY:
 i would say, "woman, please!"

PHOEBE:
  hey. ursula’s fiancée is really sweet! he’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. y’know normally y’know, i don’t like really sweaty guys. but this one? i could just mop him up!

MONICA:
 oh my god, phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 what?

MONICA:
 you’re getting a crush on your sister’s fiancée.

PHOEBE:
 no i’m not! you are!

JOEY:
  here comes the temper. 

GIRL:
 trick or treat!

RACHEL:
 hi! y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now. but someone just went out to get some and i have been giving out money but i’m out of that too. hey, can i write you a check?

GIRL:

RACHEL:

GIRL:

RACHEL:

MONA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 oh! hi!

MONA:
 hi!

CHANDLER:
 joey’s gonna be thrilled! he was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.

MONA:
 umm, actually i’m just a nurse.

CHANDLER:
 you’d think that would embarrass me, but you see i’m maxed out.

ROSS:
 hey!

MONA:
 hi!

ROSS:
 you made it!

MONA:
 wait-wait! you’re umm, you’re a potato…

ROSS:
 well, i’m a spud…

MONA:
 and the antennae…oh my god you’re spudnik!

ROSS:
 yes!

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 okay, here’s a good one for ya. who do think would win in a fight between ross and chandler.

MONICA:
 i can’t answer that! chandler’s my husband.

JOEY:
 so ross?

MONICA:
 yeah. 

ERIC:
 hey beautiful.

PHOEBE:
 hello handsome.  oh god. (walks away in shame as they kiss.) oh look at you two. so when did you guys meet?

ERIC:
 two weeks ago.

PHOEBE:
 two weeks? that’s it?

ERIC:
 yeah, i know it sounds crazy, and it’s not like me to do something so impulsive, but she’s just so perfect, and we have so much in common.

PHOEBE:
 oh really?

ERIC:
 we’re both teachers.

PHOEBE:
 huh? 

ERIC:
 and we were both in the peace corps.

PHOEBE:
 peace corps, really? 

ERIC:
 in fact when we were building houses in uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.

URSULA:
 yeah. it wasn’t a town when i got there, but it was a town when i left.  shall we get me really drunk?

ERIC:
 sure.  

CHANDLER:
 howdy doody.

ROSS:
 that’s funny. yeah. y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.

CHANDLER:
 oh relax man, relax. you’re looking a little flushed.

JOEY:
  hey-hey-hey, i think we might find out the answer to our question.

CHANDLER:
 what question?

JOEY:
 monica and i were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or ross?

CHANDLER:
 there’s no question.

JOEY:
 so you think ross too? 

CHANDLER:
  you picked ross?!

MONICA:
 ross is really strong! okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you!  except for joey.

CHANDLER:
 i cannot believe you didn’t pick me.

ROSS:
 uh, in her defense, she’s right. i am stronger. i would destroy you.

CHANDLER:
 oh really?! you think you’re stronger? why don’t you prove it? 

ROSS:
 oh i’ll prove it! i’ll prove it like a theorem!!  (they start to fight with ross pulling on chandler’s ears and chandler hitting ross over the head with his carrot.)

MONICA:
 wait-wait!! okay, stop it! stop it! stop!  now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment.

JOEY:
 hey monica!  people came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!

MONA:
 hey, you guys could arm wrestle.

JOEY:
 yeah. listen to the slutty nurse.

CHANDLER:
  you’re going down.

ROSS:
 oh yeah? you’re going further down! downtown!

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 oh gunther! you brought candy! thank you so much for picking this up! you are so sweet.

GUNTHER:

RACHEL:

KID:

RACHEL:

BOY IN THE CAPE:

RACHEL:

BOY IN THE CAPE:
 i’d rather have the money.

RACHEL:
 well, that-that’s not your choice. happy halloween!

BOY IN THE CAPE:
 this isn’t fair.

RACHEL:
 well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and i gotta give you free stuff?

BOY IN THE CAPE:
 shut up!

RACHEL:
 you shut up! 

BOY IN THE CAPE:
 you can’t tell me to shut up!

RACHEL:
 uh, i think i just did. and uh-oh, here it comes again. shut up!

JOEY:

RACHEL:
  yeah i know—i’m good—i got it! (joey slowly backs away.)  now wait a minute, i’ve got one more thing i have to say to you…oh right! shut up!

BOY IN THE CAPE:
 you’re a mean old woman. 

RACHEL:
 no! wait no! shut up—i mean don’t cry! let me get my checkbook!   

MONICA:
  look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? it’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. you’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! that’s the kind of strength that i want in the man that i love!

CHANDLER:
 that means nothing to me.  come on!  

PHOEBE:
 hi liar!

URSULA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.

URSULA:
 well they could be true.

PHOEBE:
 but they’re not!

URSULA:
 yeah, it’s a fine line huh?

PHOEBE:
 why are you lying to him?

URSULA:
 i don’t know. he said he did all this stuff and then i said i did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.

ERIC:
  honey?

URSULA:
  it’s a filthy, disgusting habit and i want you to quit now!

ERIC:
 she’s helped so many people to quit smoking.

URSULA:
 y’know, we’d really better get going.

ERIC:
 oh right, you’ve got a church group meeting tonight.

URSULA:
 right. 

ERIC:
  well, it was nice meeting you.

PHOEBE:
 you too. and ursula?! it was really nice meeting you tonight!!

JOEY:
  pheebs come on! bunny vs. doody! we’re waiting! (they go inside.)  okay. okay guys, one match, winner take all. (they grasp each other’s hand in preparation for battle.) oh wait-wait! what does the winner get?

ROSS:
 pride.

CHANDLER:
 and dignity.

JOEY:
  okay, if you say so. all right, ready? set! go! (they start wrestling, only they are unable to move either one’s arm despite a huge strain on their faces and a cheering crowd.)  watching to see who will be able to move the other’s arm first. an event that has yet 

MONA:
  wow! they’re both really strong.

JOEY:
 or equally weak.

MONICA:
  oh god!

PHOEBE:
 hmm?

MONICA:
 chandler’s making his sex face. (basically chandler’s face looks like he’s not all there and is staring off into the distance…)

ROSS:
  so, you gettin’ tired?

CHANDLER:
 nope! i can do this all day.

ROSS:
 yeah? me too.  gettin’ a little tired though.

CHANDLER:
 god, i’m exhausted.

ROSS:
 look this is starting to look really bad for me. okay? mona, mona’s standing right over there.  oh god, she’s talking to joey! you gotta let me win!

CHANDLER:
 no way! if anything you’ve gotta let me win! my wife thinks i’m a wimp!

ROSS:
 hey, at least you have a wife! i-i keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! and i’m dressed as doody.

CHANDLER:
 you’re spudnik.

ROSS:
 come on, who are we kidding? i’m doody. please? she’s watchin’.

CHANDLER:
 fine.  oh no! 

ROSS:
  oh yeah!

MONA:
  yay! my hero!

JOEY:
  you’re a weird lady.

ERIC:
  hey. ursula said she left her purse.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

ERIC:
  what a relief. it has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.

PHOEBE:
 sure it does. yeah, yeah.

ERIC:
 well, i guess i’ll see you at the wedding. (exits and phoebe follows him into the hall.)

PHOEBE:
 umm listen, i don’t think…i don’t think i’m gonna make it to the wedding. so i just want to wish you all the luck in the world.

ERIC:
 i think we’ll be okay. besides it’s so perfect and  she’s been saving herself for me.

PHOEBE:
 okay i can’t let you do this! she’s lying to you.

ERIC:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 she is lying! and i bet i can prove it. excuse me. (she grabs ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) okay. okay. yeah—not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.  okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! not a teacher, a waitress. all right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. how old did she say she was?

ERIC:
 she told me she was 25.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i almost don’t want to show this.  just remember i’m a minute younger.

ERIC:
 i am so stupid. of course she was lying! she’s not a teacher. there’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.

PHOEBE:
 no. you’re not, you’re not stupid.

ERIC:
 i’m not smart.  i just wanted so much to…be impulsive once. to be romantic.

PHOEBE:
 that’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. just…you did it with the wrong person.  what?

ERIC:
 it’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.

URSULA:
  eric!! let’s go!!

ERIC:
 i’d better go, deal…

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you should. 

URSULA:
 hurry up i gotta pray!!  

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey! well, i had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.

JOEY:
 that’s not so bad.

RACHEL:
 no, i also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. oh, i am just awful with children!

JOEY:
 come on! you’re good with kids. they’re just crazy on halloween. y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!

RACHEL:
 really? you think that’s all it is? 

JOEY:
 absolutely! halloween is the worst. except for christmas…and their birthdays. kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. and anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. y’know, kids are tough. good luck with that.  closing credits 

MONICA:
 look, i wanted to tell i’m-i’m sorry you lost.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
