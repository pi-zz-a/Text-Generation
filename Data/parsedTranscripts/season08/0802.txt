RACHEL:

JOEY:
  hey!

PHOEBE:
 oh! joey uh, were you in our room last night?

JOEY:
 no.  i was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill! 

CHANDLER:
  hi! we’re checking out of the bridal suite.

MONICA:
  that’s right. i’m no longer a bride. i’ll never be a bride again. now, i’m just someone’s wife!

CHANDLER:
 and i’m the happiest guy in the world! (monica goes and sits down in a huff.) oh honey, come on don’t be upset. we still have so much to look forward to!

MONICA:
 oh yeah, right. 

CHANDLER:
 we got the honeymoon.

MONICA:
 that’s not ‘til thursday.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 they won’t be ready for weeks.

CHANDLER:
 not the disposable cameras from the tables.

MONICA:
 that’s true!  i knew i married you for a reason!

CHANDLER:
 i’ll tell you what, i will go get them developed and you can go home.

MONICA:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 what? what did you take a picture of?

JOEY:
 nothing! it was something.

CHANDLER:
 okay ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?

RACHEL:
 are you joking? check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left.

CHANDLER:
 oh.

MONICA:
 ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

RACHEL:
 yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. until y’know, he screamed out radisson at the end.

CHANDLER:
 okay, well i’m gonna get ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 

FRONT DESK CLERK:
  here’s a copy of your bill.

MONICA:
 oh thanks.  champagne, strawberries…oh my god! i can’t believe chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!

JOEY:
 yeah, that’s sad. mashuga nut? opening credits 

ROSS:
 hi.

CHANDLER:
 hey.  soaps? shampoos? are you really taking all this stuff?

ROSS:
 why not? it’s built into the price of the room.

CHANDLER:
 yeah but you don’t need——what is this?

ROSS:
 thread!

CHANDLER:
 score! where are the disposable cameras?

ROSS:
 what disposable cameras?

CHANDLER:
 the cameras? remember last night i told you to take them?

ROSS:
 no you didn’t.

CHANDLER:
 yes! remember? right before we cut the cake, i went up to you and i said…

ROSS:
 oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if i could do you a favor, and my uncle murray came up to you and handed you a check. and then you said, "why do they call it a check? why not a yugoslavian?"  yeah, then you did that.

CHANDLER:
 so you don’t have the cameras?!

ROSS:
 no. sorry man.

CHANDLER:
 so? what? what? they’re gone! monica’s gonna freak!

ROSS:
 well, i’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. i’ll-i’ll help you look for them.

CHANDLER:
 great.

ROSS:
 in-in three minutes. (chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away. ross looks up and hands him the toilet paper ross already packed.)  

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 are you gonna open the presents without chandler?

MONICA:
 no!  but, they’re callin’ out to me! i mean this little guy  even crawled up into my lap. oh come on, chandler wouldn’t mind if i opened just one present! what do you think it is?

PHOEBE:
 a little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman. 

MONICA:
 a tiny salt shaker!!!

PHOEBE:
 ohhh! my god! for tiny salt!

MONICA:
 oh wow! okay. well that was fun.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah.

MONICA:
 good. okay, i’m just gonna wait for chandler to open the rest of them.

PHOEBE:
 okay.

MONICA:
 whew. although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. i mean… i guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. what do you think?

PHOEBE:
 well i guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. y’know, it’s probably this one. 

MONICA:
 or this one! 

RACHEL:
  hi.

MONICA:
 hey, how are you feelin’? any morning sickness?

RACHEL:
 shh-shh-shh! the guys don’t know yet do they?

MONICA:
 no! joey and ross don’t know anything and chandler still thinks that phoebe’s pregnant.

PHOEBE:
 yeah that’s right chandler does still think i’m pregnant. he hasn’t asked me how i’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. boy, i feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.  after you of course.

RACHEL:
 don’t worry i promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause i’m going to tell the father today.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, is it someone in this building? is it that tall guy from the first floor?

RACHEL:
 ew! no!

PHOEBE:
 what?! i think he’s cute.

RACHEL:
 well then you have his baby.

PHOEBE:
 believe me i’m trying.

MONICA:
 wow. y’know it is so weird. i mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. you’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. you’re like ed mcmahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

RACHEL:
 yeah. uh-huh, i guess it is pretty big news.

PHOEBE:
 pretty big? it’s huge! god, this guy doesn’t have a clue! he’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘i had sex with rachel green. i rock!’ then bam! he’s a father and everything’s different.

RACHEL:
 well it’s only different if he wants it to be. i mean, i’m not gonna ask him for anything.

PHOEBE:
 okay. then he still has this huge decision to make. now he’s walking around thinking, ‘do i want to be a dad?’ and then bam!

MONICA:
 what was that bam?

PHOEBE:
 i don’t. he got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.

JOEY:
  hey!

RACHEL:
 hey joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?

JOEY:
  who called here? did she sound blond? huh? did-did-did she have an accent? i gotta make a call!  i shoulda never walked into that sunglass hut!

RACHEL:
 oh joey! joey! no, it’s not you! you didn’t get anybody pregnant!

JOEY:
 oh. why would you scare me like that? what the hell is going on?  is somebody pregnant?

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah. that’s me.

JOEY:
 oh my god pheebs! you’re gonna have a baby?

PHOEBE:
 yes. yes i am. oh my god, i’m gonna have a baby! (joey and phoebe hug.)

JOEY:
 whoa, wait a minute. who’s the father?

PHOEBE:
 you don’t know him. it’s not important. he wants nothing to do with me or the baby. 

JOEY:
 well who is this guy?! huh? who is he? ‘cause i will track him down and kick his ass!

PHOEBE:
 david lynn.

JOEY:
 david lynn! david lynn! david lynn!! 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh some guy from my gym. a little annoying. 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 yes! and that’s why i’m under the table. celebrating.

ROSS:
 well i checked in the uh, lost and found, i talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.

CHANDLER:
 well this is great. y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer monica up today, she’s really depressed.

ROSS:
 now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?

CHANDLER:
 all my energy is going into not asking that question. i can’t believe i screwed this up!

ROSS:
 i’m sorry man.  here’s a thought. this is the same ballroom. there’s a band. there’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.

CHANDLER:
 are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

ROSS:
 no-no-no, i’m saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. all we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.

CHANDLER:
 are you serious?

ROSS:
 i’m just thinking about your new bride at home. okay? do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?

CHANDLER:
 marriage advice? really?!

ROSS:
 i’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! aren’t these the same flowers?

CHANDLER:
 i don’t know, monica picked out the flowers.

ROSS:
 what about the chairs?

CHANDLER:
 she picked those out too.

ROSS:
 how about the place settings?

CHANDLER:
 that was her.

ROSS:
 what did you do?

CHANDLER:
 i was in charge of the cameras! gift shop?

ROSS:
 hmm.  

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 phoebe the father is not here okay? i haven’t told him yet and i don’t think i can tell him at all now!

PHOEBE:
 why not?

RACHEL:
 i don’t know, let me think. i was walking down the street thinking, ‘i’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!

PHOEBE:
 bus?

RACHEL:
 no, you! phoebe you freaked me out. you kept saying how huge this all is!

PHOEBE:
 well-well but it is huge.

RACHEL:
 i know, but i was just thinking about how huge this is for me. i didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

PHOEBE:
 you’re thinking about this way too much. just tell him and get it over with. it’s like, it’s like ripping off this band-aid.  quick and painless, watch.  oh mother of…see?  

JOEY:
  ooh-ooh-ooh! are we opening presents?

MONICA:
 no! no! i shouldn’t have even opened these! i mean i—joey i am out of control!! joey, you have to do me a favor. no matter what i say, no matter what i do, please do not let me open another present! okay?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
  now i can’t believe it! what? rachel’s pregnant?  who’s the father?

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 ohh… i wonder if that dude.

MONICA:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 about a month ago this guy spent the night with rachel, i didn’t see who it was but… 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 the guy left this.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MAN AT THE WEDDING:

CHANDLER:

WOMAN AT THE WEDDING:

ROSS:

MAN AT THE WEDDING:

WOMAN AT THE WEDDING:

CHANDLER:

MAN AT THE WEDDING:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 what? hey wait a minute! phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

PHOEBE:
 i may play the fool at times, but i’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit.  i believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

RACHEL:
 oh god… oh, he’s in there right now?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the band-aid off. what to you want to do?

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

TAG:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

ROSS:

ANXIOUS WEDDING GUEST:

CHANDLER:

TAG:

PHOEBE:

TAG:

PHOEBE:

TAG:
 what’s going on rach?

RACHEL:
 nothing! phoebe kinda made a mistake. but y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

TAG:
 y’know, i’m actually glad phoebe called. (he pulls out a stool and rachel sits down.) i know we broke up because you thought i wasn’t mature enough, but i’ve really grown up and think we should get back together.

RACHEL:
 oh, it’s just not the right time.

TAG:

RACHEL:
 okay.

JOEY:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 yeah! oh and interesting because i found the cameras in one of our bags! 

ROSS:
 huh, didn’t see that coming.

CHANDLER:
 okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. which by the look on your face i’m sure you’ll remember. so we don’t need——there’s no need to have this picture. how about i take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

MONICA:
 that would be a good idea.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
