CHANDLER:
 oh my god!

MONICA:
 i know.

CHANDLER:
 i’m gonna miss being able to afford food.

MONICA:
 i’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! and the saleswoman was looking at me like, "oh, these are way too expensive for you."

CHANDLER:
 she had a point.  

RACHEL:
  hi!

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh my god!  oh monica! those boots are amazing!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 how can you let him talk to your crotch like that?

RACHEL:
  he’s talking to the baby.

PHOEBE:
 ohh! okay! okay, cause when-when he said, "i can’t wait to hear your first words," i thought, "there’s a trick."

RACHEL:
 okay. well, i gotta go you guys. i’ll see you later.

PHOEBE:
 okay.

ROSS:
 bye.

RACHEL:
 bye. 

JOEY:
 oh hey rach, listen—hi!

RACHEL:
 hi.

JOEY:
 umm, can you do me a favor? i was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at ralph lauren…

RACHEL:
 no, forget it! no way! i am not sending anymore ralph lauren clothes to prison. it is a waste.

JOEY:
 no-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. my youngest sister, dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.

RACHEL:
 i guess i can talk to one of my supervisors…

JOEY:
 oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!

RACHEL:
 really?! oh my god! i’m successful!

JOEY:
 okay, so will you meet with her?

RACHEL:
 yes! i’d love to! have her come by the office.

JOEY:
 great! thanks! you’re gonna love her so much. and—oh, she’s the smartest of all the tribbiani children. hey, y’know the s.a.t’s?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 she took ‘em! (joey goes to get coffee and rachel exits as the camera pans to phoebe and ross on the couch.)

PHOEBE:
 hey ross! doesn’t ben go to the smithfield day school?

ROSS:
 yeah. why?

PHOEBE:
 sting has a son that goes there too!

ROSS:
 yeah i know; he’s in ben’s class.

PHOEBE:
 you knew this and you never said anything?! with all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!

ROSS:
 fine! no more dinosaur stuff! can i talk about fossils? (joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)

PHOEBE:
 sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.

ROSS:
 what are you reading? the kidnappers guide to manhattan private schools?

PHOEBE:
 no, it’s new york magazine. it’s an article about the best schools in the city. so how well do you know sting?

ROSS:
 uh, i actually haven’t even met him.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. i really want to go to his concert friday night, but it’s totally sold out. i know! why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! if you get two i’ll take you.

ROSS:
 well actually, i’m picking ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.

PHOEBE:
 there you go! oh, you are so lucky! you might actually get to meet sting tomorrow! that’s why you have kids!  

MONICA:
 hey guys!

CHANDLER:
 hey-hey.

RACHEL:
 hi monica!

MONICA:
 hey. 

RACHEL:
 hi boots.

MONICA:
 see chandler? i’m getting a lot of use out of them already! they’re very practical. see, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…

CHANDLER:
 you can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. 

PHOEBE:
 wow! they’re beautiful!

RACHEL:
 ahh…

MONICA:
  they hurt so much!

PHOEBE:
 what?!

MONICA:
 the guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!

RACHEL:
 well-well you can give them to me! i haven’t felt my feet in years!

MONICA:
 i can’t! i spent so much money on them and i told chandler that i’d wear them all the time, i just can’t give them away!

PHOEBE:
 well then get your money back and return them!

MONICA:
 i can’t do that either! the soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.

ROSS:
  hey!

CHANDLER:
  hey!

ROSS:
 hey i uh just picked up ben from school…

CHANDLER:
  i don’t think you did a very thorough job!

ROSS:
 i dropped him off at carol’s.  anyway, it turns out that i’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.

PHOEBE:
 oh no! why not?

ROSS:
 well it turns out that ben and sting’s son do not get along.

PHOEBE:
 how come?!

ROSS:
 apparently, sting’s son made fun of the fact that ben’s moms are lesbinims.

PHOEBE:
 wait! but ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. make them be friends.

ROSS:
 phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.

PHOEBE:
 sure you can! give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!

ROSS:
 playpen?! ben’s seven!

PHOEBE:
 your kid is seven?!  he’s really small.  please! please get the tickets!

ROSS:
 look i’m sorry pheebs, i can’t do it.

PHOEBE:
 yes you can! sting says so himself!

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
  rosssss can!

ROSS:
 look phoebe, i’m sorry it’s just…

PHOEBE:
  rossss can!

ROSS:
 phoebe, i…

PHOEBE:
  rosss can! give me the tickets! ross can give me the tickets!!  

JOEY:
  here she is! future fashion superstar!

RACHEL:
 oh joey, i’m hardly a…

JOEY:
 my little sister dina!

RACHEL:
 right! hi dina! 

DINA:
 hi.

RACHEL:
 nice to meet you. 

DINA:
 thanks so much for meetin’ with me. joey’s told me so much about you!

JOEY:
 this is so exciting for her. well, i’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business. 

RACHEL:
 okay. all right dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…

DINA:
 i…i don’t care about fashion! i’m pregnant! and i know you are too, so you gotta help me!

RACHEL:
  and there’s marketing…  on the step and changes from wearing tennis shoes to the boots and she moans in pain as 

MONICA:
  ahhhhhhhh!

CHANDLER:
  what’s wrong?

MONICA:
 oh nothing i’m just—just was yawning. (mimics the groan from before and stretches.)

CHANDLER:
 oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (they go into the apartment.)

MONICA:
 honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?

CHANDLER:
 now sweetie, i know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. see? every cloud has a…supple leather lining.

MONICA:
 i-i don’t-i don’t think that i’m gonna wear the boots tonight.

CHANDLER:
 why not?

MONICA:
 well y’know, i’m just-i’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. or! or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!

CHANDLER:
 do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company?

MONICA:
 anyway, i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.

CHANDLER:
 you said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!

MONICA:
 fine! if you want me to wear the boots, i’ll wear the boots. in fact, i’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 okay?  ooo wee! christmas party in my boots! (runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ with laughing.)  

DINA:
 i-i can’t go in there. i can’t tell him!

RACHEL:
 honey, it’s going to be okay. he’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (she gives dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)

DINA:
 thank you.

RACHEL:
 okay. 

JOEY:
 hey! it’s my fashion girls!  what’s wrong?

RACHEL:
 honey, why don’t you sit down? dina has something that she wants to tell you.

JOEY:
  oh. what’s, what’s going on? is it mom? is she sick? is it dad’s heart? is that a sandwich?

DINA:
 joe, mom and dad are fine…

JOEY:
 is that a sandwich?!

RACHEL:
 joey…there’s something that you…should know. dina?

DINA:
 i’m pregnant.

JOEY:
  what?!

RACHEL:
  now! give him the sandwich! give him the sandwich! (she quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)

JOEY:
 well obviously this is a mistake! you can’t be pregnant! because you have to have sex to get pregnant!

DINA:
 joe, i tried to wait until i was 25 like you did!

RACHEL:
 what?! dina…

JOEY:
  i can’t believe this! you’re the good one! you went to college! both years! who did this to you?!

DINA:
 bobby corso, but he’s a real nice guy. i like him a lot. he’s real funny.

JOEY:
 you got pregnant for funny?! dina…if he’s funny…laugh! all right, i’ll be back in a little while! you stay here!

DINA:
 why? where are you going?

JOEY:
 i can’t look at you right now! 

DINA:
 wow.

RACHEL:
 i know. (joey storms back in and covering his face so he doesn’t see dina grabs the sandwich and heads back out.) commercial break  

PHOEBE:
 oh, there you are ben!

BEN:
 aunt phoebe, what are you doing here?

PHOEBE:
 well, i heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. and so i thought i would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. now umm, the boy’s name is sting’s son.

BEN:
 jack? i hate him! he’s a jerk.

PHOEBE:
 now ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.

BEN:
 i have to go. my friend doug is waiting for me over there. (goes over to doug.)

PHOEBE:
 him you’re friends with. (starts looking at the children trying to find jack and a teacher notices her.)

THE TEACHER:
 excuse me. can, can i help you with something?

PHOEBE:
 yes! yes you can, i’m looking for jack’s parents.

THE TEACHER:
 are you with one of the students?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh, i’m with ben.

THE TEACHER:
 are you one of ben’s mothers?

PHOEBE:
 i am one of ben’s mothers. i’m a lesbian. it was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.

THE TEACHER:
 well hi, i’m jenny boone. i’m the new teacher here.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

THE TEACHER:
 i’ve only met your partner carol.

PHOEBE:
 ah! okay so that would make me susan.

THE TEACHER:
 right. are you looking for jack’s parents to discuss the problems he’s having with ben?  yeah. because i really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! let’s do that!! that-that sounds good. we should sit down and talk, just me, my lover carol, and the stings. umm, how-how will i get in touch with them?

THE TEACHER:
 oh, their number is on the contact sheet.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. uh-huh. umm, could-could i get a copy of that? ‘cause carol threw it out, she lost ours. she’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.  

CHANDLER:
 y’know, that party wasn’t bad.

MONICA:
 yeah! i didn’t know there would be dancing. that was a fun surprise!

CHANDLER:
 i don’t see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk?

MONICA:
 oh no, we can’t walk!

CHANDLER:
 what honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. let’s go.

MONICA:
 hey! do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?

CHANDLER:
 what’s going on?

MONICA:
 i can’t walk. okay? okay? these boots were a huge mistake!

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 okay you were right! all right, i never should have bought them! they’re killing me! one toe at a time!

CHANDLER:
 so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right.  it’s oddly unsettling.

MONICA:
 how are we gonna get home? maybe a piggy-back ride?

CHANDLER:
 hop on.

MONICA:
 okay. wait, just give me a second, i need to just get my boots off first.  ah…ooh…oohh…ohh…oh god…ohh…oh…ohh…ohhhh…

CHANDLER:
 honey, i know you’re in pain right now, but i’m a little turned on.  

DINA:
 do you ever worry that you’ll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?

RACHEL:
 what college was that dina? 

DINA:
 oh my god! bobby!

BOBBY:
 hi dina. good to see you.

RACHEL:
 joey, what are you doing?

JOEY:
 just what needs to be done! dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…

RACHEL:
 oh joey this is crazy!

JOEY:
 don’t interrupt me when i’m talkin’ to god! now where were we? oh right, okay. do you dina, take this man…

DINA:
 no!

JOEY:
 oh you’ll take ‘em!

DINA:
 no i won’t!

JOEY:
 hey! you don’t get a say in this!

DINA:
 yes i do!

JOEY:
 ahhh! i heard "i do", we’re halfway there! okay!  you!

RACHEL:
 all right joey! that is enough! (grabs him and pulls him away from bobby and dina) listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. okay? they-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!

BOBBY:
 yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.

JOEY:
 well what am i supposed to do?

RACHEL:
 you’re supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.

JOEY:
 no they can’t! they were stupid enough to get knocked up!

RACHEL:
 heyyyyy! contraceptives are not always effective!  right?

BOBBY:
 yeah…we kinda didn’t use any…

RACHEL:
 oh, come on kids! a little help here!  

PHOEBE:
 wow! this place is incredible!  sting’s pen…that he gave to phoebe.  come on! secret passageway! 

TRUDIE STYLER:
 hi! 

PHOEBE:
 hi!

TRUDIE STYLER:
 i’m trudie.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh.

TRUDIE STYLER:
 you must be ben’s mum.

PHOEBE:
 why else would i be here?

TRUDIE STYLER:
 do sit down.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. 

TRUDIE STYLER:
 i gather jack and ben haven’t been getting along lately.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

TRUDIE STYLER:
 i’m told there are two sides to this story, but all i’ve heard is that ben’s a bit of a poo-poo head.

PHOEBE:
 umm, i’m sorry. won’t-won’t jack’s father be joining us?

TRUDIE STYLER:
 oh i’m sorry, jack’s father is not available.

PHOEBE:
 uh-hmm. okay. well then, could we reschedule? for say, friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?

TRUDIE STYLER:
 oh no, i know that wouldn’t work. my husband’s in concert.

PHOEBE:
 concert. yeah. that does put us in…quite a pickle. because you see i’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.

TRUDIE STYLER:
 so, i guess you and i should talk about jack and ben right now.

PHOEBE:
 unless! unless umm, okay i-i would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.

TRUDIE STYLER:
 are you here for tickets?

PHOEBE:
 oh, thank you. four would be great.

TRUDIE STYLER:
 i’m not giving concert tickets to someone who’d use their son like this!

PHOEBE:
 oh good! then you’re in luck! ben’s not my son!

TRUDIE STYLER:
  look, i’ve just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. any minute now, the police will be here!

PHOEBE:
 the police? here? a reunion?!  

CHANDLER:
 okay, ten blocks down. five to go.

MONICA:
  oh wait! stop! stop! stop!

CHANDLER:
 oh i’m sorry! do you need a break?

MONICA:
 my boots in tan! hey! can you get a little closer so i can see the price?

CHANDLER:
 i can see it from right here. it’ll cost you one husband.

MONICA:
 okay, i’m sorry. i think i can walk the rest of the way now. just-just give me my boots.

CHANDLER:
  i don’t have your boots.

MONICA:
 well i don’t have them either. where are they?

CHANDLER:
 well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay!

MONICA:
 okay.  god well, we gotta go back and get them!

CHANDLER:
 honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?

MONICA:
 okay, i’m never gonna wear them again. i just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.

CHANDLER:
 y’know what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones.

MONICA:
 okay.  all right.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

MONICA:
   

RACHEL:
 joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. maybe they have a plan!

JOEY:
 oh? oh! okay! okay! let’s hear their plan! now, what’s the future look like for dina and bobby?

BOBBY:
 well…i really have high hopes for my band.

JOEY:
  you were right. he is funny.

RACHEL:
 hey, now wait a minute! i get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! now come on bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?

BOBBY:
 well it’s just me and my pal rooster, the band’s name is numb nuts.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! even if it is to bobby!  dude, that’s not a compliment!

DINA:
 no joey! i knew you wouldn’t be supportive!

JOEY:
 so whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! what are you gonna do? you’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! you can’t be a single mother alone! you’re gonna ruin your life!

RACHEL:
 oh excuse me! am i ruining my life?

JOEY:
 no! no! no! it’s different for you. you’re so strong and together. you’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.

DINA:
 excuse me?

JOEY:
 one pregnant woman at a time, please! i just want you to be okay.

RACHEL:
 so forcing her to marry bobby is gonna make that happen?

JOEY:
 maybe!  well! well…so-so uh, what kind of music does numb nuts—oh forget it! i can’t!

DINA:
 joey, i am scared to death about this. but i really think i can do it, i’m just gonna need some help. and bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.

BOBBY:
 you bet i am!  and to answer your earlier question, we’re straight-up gangster rap. 

DINA:
 look, rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. why can’t you do that for me?

JOEY:
 because! ‘cause… ‘cause you’re my baby sister!

DINA:
 and you’re my big brother! i mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world. i’m not even scared to tell mom and dad. i was scared of telling you.

JOEY:
 well i’d be scared of them, but all right.

DINA:
 joey, i can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. i want him to have his uncle. is my baby gonna have his uncle joey?

JOEY:
 of course he’s gonna have his uncle joey!

DINA:
 we’re gonna be all right. i mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. not just by us.

JOEY:
 that’s right! by his uncle too!

BOBBY:
 and by you.

RACHEL:
 okay bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. 

JOEY:
 come here! 

RACHEL:
 no! seriously! what’s wrong with you?! closing credits 

ROSS:
 you’re gonna love me so much. i got sting tickets!! 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! i do love you! how did you do it?!

ROSS:
 well…let’s just say…  rosss caaaaan!

PHOEBE:
 oo, where are the seats?

ROSS:
 uh, middle balcony.

PHOEBE:
 okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from sting, his wife, or a member of his family?

ROSS:
 yeah.
