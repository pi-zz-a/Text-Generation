chandler| okay, she is the star of the play. and she is my girlfriend! i get to have sex with the star of the play!
ross| people can hear you.
chandler| i know!! 
chandler| wow! she looks great. doesn’t she?
ross| yeah. (onstage there’s a knock on the door and kathy opens it. we don’t see what’s going on, only hear it.) 
kathy's co-star| hi!
kathy| hi!
ross| that is one good looking man!
chandler| is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
kathy's co-star| sooo, you’ve been doing this long?
kathy| no, you’re my first. put the money on the table. (ross and chandler have stunned looks on their faces as kathy and her co-star start making out.)
kathy's co-star| oh, yeah! ooh, that’s nice. (they start making out harder.)
ross| dude!
kathy's co-star| is that an expensive blouse?
kathy| if you want it to be.  (kathy’s co-star rips her blouse off and buttons go flying into the audience, and one hits ross. chandler’s mouth is on the floor.)
ross| here’s your girlfriend’s button.  opening credits  
phoebe| oh, hey, mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
monica| yeah, i think i have some around here somewhere. why? 
phoebe| well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive. 
monica| hey, rach! i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. if you could just……throw your purses at it.
rachel| bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. 
monica| oh my god, are you out of a job?
rachel| no, but they stuck me in personal shopping. which is just a huge step down!
phoebe| personal shopping? what is that? like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
rachel| uh-huh.
phoebe| that sounds great!
joey| 
monica| umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. you can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
joey|  there’s gravy?
monica| if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. that fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.  
monica| what are you doing?
joey| i think i left a donut up here.  
ross| hey!
phoebe| hey!
joey| hey!
phoebe| ooh! how was kathy’s play?
ross| well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.
chandler| yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
phoebe| that’s a good idea for a business!
chandler|" i’m totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. y'know it’ll be like, ""so where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, chester?"" and she’ll go, ""no-no-no, it’s chandler."" and he’ll go, ""whatever. ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
joey|  that-that is a good trick.
chandler| all right, look, look, what am i gonna do?
joey| chandler, look they’re actors. they’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. i mean just ‘cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.
ross| oh-oh, alec baldwin and kim basinger.
joey| tom cruise and nicole kidman. 
ross| yeah.
phoebe| hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood.
ross| they’re not a couple!
phoebe| oh-okay, i get the game now.
joey| okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
ross| oh yeah!
joey| well okay, so then you’re fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. it’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.
chandler| really?
joey| look, you guys have been to every play i’ve ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?
ross| no.
joey| noooo!!  
chandler| so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
ross| y’know what, i don’t know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
chandler| yeah, i know but…
ross| oh no-no-no, i’m there.
monica|  hey!
joey| hey mon! want some pancakes?
monica| you made pancakes?
joey| yep! grab a plate.
monica| okay. (she does so and starts to walk towards joey to receive her pancakes.)
joey| no-no, stay right there. (monica stops and joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) gettin’ closer.
chandler| okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which i’m fairly certain are the same thing.
joey| listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here saturday night, if people want to come over.
ross| oh yeah!
monica| oh, i was thinking about having people over for the game.
joey| oh yeah, who’s playing?
monica| the players.
ross| somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
monica|  please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.
joey| all right pheebs, stick out your plate!
phoebe| oh. (joey flips the pancake and phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.) 
rachel|  monica, i’m quitting! i just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!  i’m telling you i’m quitting! that’s it! i’m talking to my boss right now!  yes i am!  yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! okay bye, call me when you get this message.  oh! mr. waltham, i ah really need to talk to you.
mr. waltham| in a moment, please, i’m in the middle of a task. and you have a customer.  (it’s a really good-looking man, joshua, that rachel has an instant crush on. well actually it’s tate donovan, so it’s not like she’s really testing her acting skills.)
rachel| hi!
joshua| hi, i’m joshua.
rachel| hi, i’m rachel green. what can i do for you joshua?
joshua| well, i need a whole new wardrobe. my wife, well my ex-wife…
rachel| oh, i’m so sorry. (he walks over to look and some clothes and rachel quickly turns around and adjusts her bra, trying to show off her assets.)
joshua| anyway, she burned all of my clothes. i got away with two things. this suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
rachel| well, at least that’s a great suit.
joshua| yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.  so i need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, i’m all yours.
rachel| okay.
mr. waltham| rachel, you needed to speak to me?
rachel| no-no, that wasn’t me!  well, we should get started. let me show you my underwear.  the selection of underwear we carry. 
rachel| oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (motions to the correct way.)
joshua| it’s this way? sorry. (he walks past her and she again admires his butt.)  
chandler| i’m right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means!
ross| all right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them.
chandler| come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
ross| here she comes. don’t say a word, okay? just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.
kathy| hey you guys!
ross| hey!
kathy| hi!  thank you so much for coming again. did you like it tonight?
ross| oh, absolutely! 
kathy| wasn’t nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit? 
kathy| it’s a good play, isn’t it? 
chandler| oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly you’re having sex with him.
ross| okay, i… 
kathy| clearly, i’m having sex with him?
chandler| oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!
kathy| okay, so let me just get this straight. you’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
chandler| y’know, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.
kathy| acting! chandler, this is my job! i’m-i’m playing a part in a play! how can you not trust me?!
chandler| well, you can understand, given how we started.
kathy| oh, wow. i can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.
chandler| well, that is what happened, and i don’t even see you denying this!
kathy| i’ll tell you what, chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!
chandler| yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon! commercial break  
rachel| i have the best job in the entire world! the most adorable guy came over today, and i got to dress him up all day!
phoebe| rachel has a new doll.
rachel| oh, i wish he was a doll, then i could get a rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. oh! and he has the most beautiful name, i never realised it, joshua! josh-u-a! joshua! josh.
ross| uh, hello!
rachel| hi-e!!
phoebe| ooh, what do i smell?
joey| i don’t know, it smells good. (he goes over and opens the door to reveal monica holding a plate of cookies and a fan to blow the smell across the hall.)
monica| fresh cookies! hot from the oven!
phoebe| ooh! 
monica| please, have some!
ross| oh, yumm!
monica| yeah, i’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
joey|  wow! the new playboy!
monica| yeah, it’s just something i picked up.
ross| cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!! 
phoebe| what? what?
rachel| well, it was just something josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
ross| yeah, how does jason look in a v-neck?
rachel| it’s joshua.
ross| oh, whatever. (laughs and gives joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. joey follows him)
monica| wait! wait! this isn’t take-out!
phoebe|  well, i hate to eat and run, but…
monica| no, wait, please don’t go! i’ve got porn for you too!
phoebe| yeah, i don’t need it.
monica| people are supposed to wanna hang out here!
rachel| why? honey, what is the big deal?
monica| i’m the hostess! not those guys! i’m always the hostess! i mean, i was always the hostess, i mean even when i was little, i mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, i-i served the best air.
phoebe| well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
monica| ‘cause they took our apartment, i wanted to punish them. but i’m-i’m done now. they’ve suffered enough.
phoebe| if you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here! 
rachel| yeah, that’s true.
monica| all right then, when i’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!
phoebe| oh, are we gonna trash that place? 
chandler| steps! (he opens the door to his apartment to ross and joey looking at the new playboy) slut! (ross and joey quickly hide the playboy behind their backs. chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy!
all| what?!
ross| so you were right?
chandler| i confronted her, and she didn’t deny it!  i don’t live here! 
ross| chandler!
rachel| chandler, what did she say?
phoebe| wait a minute.
joey| come here.
monica| are you sure?
chandler| well, i may be drunk, but i know what she said! then i went over to beefsteak julie’s…
rachel| beefsteak charlie’s?
chandler| yes! see you and i have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)  polishing machines through the hallway. rachel comes up the steps and stops when she sees 
rachel| whoops.  oh, hey, do you need help with that?
monica| nah, i got it.
rachel| ooh, i just feel bad, i never vacuum. (she goes into chandler and joey’s.) 
rachel| hi!
all| hey!
rachel| so i was with joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. it’s just so frustrating!
phoebe| why don’t you ask him out?
joey| oh, yeah, totally! that’s such a turn-on!
rachel| really? it doesn’t seem desperate?
joey| oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.
phoebe| he just got a divorce right? 
rachel| hmm-mmm.
phoebe| so he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? maybe, you just have to make the first move.
rachel| yeah but, i’ve never asked a guy out before.
phoebe|  you’ve never asked a guy out?!!
rachel| no. have you?
phoebe| thousands of times!! that doesn’t make me sound too good does it?
rachel| i don’t even know how i would go about it.
joey|" oh-oh-oh-oh, how i do it is, i look a woman up and down and say, ""hey, how you doin’?"""
phoebe| oh, please!
joey|  hey, how you doin’? 
rachel| you know what, i’m gonna do that, i’m gonna call him up, and i’m gonna ask him out. i can do that. ask him out.  how you doin’?  hi! joshua? it’s rachel green from bloomingdale’s.  yeah, umm, i was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? well, we found a wallet, and we— the license? well, that is a good idea! uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. i’ll see you tomorrow. bye.  you’ve done that a thousand times?
phoebe| i’ve never done that.
rachel| ohh, god, i just got so nervous that he would say no.
joey| well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. like uh, knicks tickets! invite the guy to a knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!
rachel| really?! you think that will work?
joey| absolutely! and if it doesn’t, can i get the extra ticket? 
joey| what the heck is that? (they go open the door and reveal monica being spun around on the floor polisher and getting the cord wrapped around her legs.)  
chandler| did she call?
phoebe| no, sorry.
chandler| all right, maybe i should call her.
joey| no! forget her, man! you don’t need her, you don’t need that!
ross| he’s right, what she did was unforgivable.
chandler| well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if i was wrong?
ross| how might you be wrong?
chandler| well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?
joey| dude, tell me she actually told you this.
chandler| she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. back me up here, ross!
ross| that’s all you’re basing this on?
chandler| that’s not backing me up! look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
joey| whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! there’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. the lone gunman. communism. geometry.
chandler| oh my god!!  
rachel| would you like to go to a basketball game with me?  you know, its funny, basketball, because i happen to have tickets too…  umm, who likes the knicks—
joshua| what do you think?
rachel| oh! well, as a single woman, who is available, i think you look great!
joshua| huh. (she starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the mirror.) yeah?
rachel| yep. oh, yeah, look you great. (she puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) oh yeah. yeah, this looks great.  umm, so you like it?
joshua| i do. i do. i love it. in fact, i think i’m gonna wear it home.
rachel| great.
joshua| all right, thank you so much for all your help. 
rachel| sure.
joshua| well, i guess this is uh, i guess this is it.
rachel| yeah-eah-ha!
joshua| thanks.  maybe i’ll see in the spring, with the uh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits.
rachel| oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!
joshua| ah, that’s okay, thanks.
rachel| okay.
joshua| anyway, hopefully, i’ll see you around sometime. (he goes out the door.)
rachel| basketball!
joshua|  i’m sorry.
rachel| i uh, i have two tickets to the knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.
joshua| wow! that would be great.
rachel| really?
joshua| yeah, that would be fantastic! my-my nephew is crazy about the knicks! this is fantastic, thank you so much rachel. (he takes the tickets and leaves as mr. waltham returns.)
mr. waltham| good morning.
joshua| hi!  
kathy|  hey.
chandler| hey. i just, i just wanted to come over to-to say that i’m sorry. y’know? i know i acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and i can completely understand why you were so upset.
kathy| oh wow. i really wish you’d call me.
chandler| yeah, i know, i-i wish i had too, but y’know i-i think this is a good thing. y'know? ‘cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. y’know, i know for me— nick’s pants?
kathy| yeah.
chandler| yeah. well, i think our second fight is going to be a big one!  rejection earlier that day and telling her what she should’ve done. ross and phoebe 
joey| okay, for next time, what do you say?
rachel| i have an extra ticket. an extra ticket. not, two tickets, i have an extra ticket.
ross| so the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
rachel| he didn’t turn me down! he’s at the game isn’t he? i got the date, i’m just not on it!
monica|  okay, it’s ready. come on.
joey| what’s ready?
monica| just come.  
ross| oh my god!
rachel| wow! monica!
phoebe| great!
ross| this is beautiful! (she has cleaned it, completely redecorated it, removed the carpet, and polished the floor.)
phoebe| oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?
monica| pretty much.  so, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
joey| i don’t know, it looks the same.
monica| you used to have carpet.
joey| oh yeah!
monica| so i made snacks. please, just hang out okay? i’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
ross| look, mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
monica| oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. i’m always the hostess. 
ross| hey!
joey| how’d it go?
chandler| well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.
phoebe| oh good!
chandler| she is now.
ross| what are you saying?
chandler| i’m saying that she… is a devil woman! y’know i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick! nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! i hate him, i hate her! well, i don’t hate her, i love her. this is all my fault really.
phoebe| how? how is your fault?
chandler| because, i-i should’ve called! y’know if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples!
rachel| honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
ross| well, if-if she thought they were on a break…  closing credits  
mr. waltham| rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. a joshua bergen. 
rachel| really?
mr. waltham| will you call him?
