CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 yeah, they do! quit being a baby and leave me alone! there, you’ve just had your first class!

MONICA:

JOEY:
 yeah, rach, i think you’re handling that really well.

RACHEL:
 handling it? what do you mean, handling it? there’s nothing to handle. now, maybe i would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and joshua. y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!

CHANDLER:
 what?

RACHEL:
 come on! they rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! i mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? a year? and somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. i’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i don’t dance at weddings.

RACHEL:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when i dance, i look like this… (starts to dancing really, really, really badly. ross enters behind him and he stops.)

ROSS:

RACHEL:

JOSHUA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 yep! and! a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (they’re stunned.) joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.

PHOEBE:
 oh, how’d that happen?

CHANDLER:
 because i’m cooler.

MONICA:
 no, seriously.

CHANDLER:
 well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—joey was unconscious.  

JOEY:
  hey you guys! what’s happening?

MONICA:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 what is that?

JOEY:
  oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.

MONICA:
 well, are you asleep right now, joe? ‘cause i don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!

JOEY:
  i know i don’t have too! it tastes good. 

CHANDLER:
 plus, you look cool.  

RACHEL:
  well, i just called joshua…

PHOEBE:
 oh, how did it go?

RACHEL:
 well, i did my best to convince him that i’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—i’m just going through a hard time.

PHOEBE:
 what did he say?

RACHEL:
 well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. ugh. i feel blue.

MONICA:
 ohh, sweetie!  hey, i bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.

RACHEL:
 yeah, maybe, but i don’t think i even care. i don’t think he’s the one i’m sad about. y’know, i know that i said that i am totally okay with ross getting married, but as it turns out, i don’t think i’m handling it all that well.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, maybe.

RACHEL:
 and i-i am just trying to figure out why.

PHOEBE:
 any luck?

RACHEL:
 well, yeah, y’know how ross and i were on again, off again, on again, off again? i guess i just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.

MONICA:
 again. y’know what? i think we all did.

ROSS:
  hey!

MONICA:
 hey! (she jumps up and throws emily’s wedding dress into rachel’s room.)

ROSS:
 so, i got us some reservations for sunday night, okay? how about, ernie’s at 9 o’clock?

RACHEL:
 yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.

ROSS:
 oh, see i-i don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.

RACHEL:
 three people. joshua’s not gonna be there.

ROSS:
 what happened?

RACHEL:
 uh, well, i think, i think he broke up with me.

ROSS:
 noo. why?

RACHEL:
 well, apparently he scares easy.

ROSS:
 oh, rachel, i’m-i’m sorry.

RACHEL:
 it’s okay. sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.

ROSS:
 come here. 

RACHEL:
  oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up emily?

ROSS:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 you okay?

RACHEL:
 yeah! i got my girls. 

RACHEL:
 ugh. 

PHOEBE:
  hey, y’know what might cheer you up?

RACHEL:
 what?  

RACHEL:
 y’know, i gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.

MONICA:
 oh, i wish there was a job where i could wear this all the time.  maybe someday, there will be. 

MONICA:
 oh god! he’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!

RACHEL:
 oh, okay! 

MONICA:
 no-no, rachel, don’t get it! he can’t see us!

PHOEBE:
 no, yeah! the groom cannot see the bride!

RACHEL:
 i’m not gonna marry chandler!

PHOEBE:
 not after this!

RACHEL:
 okay, you guys, just relax. (she goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) i doooo. (sees that it’s joshua, not chandler that knocked on the door.)

JOSHUA:
 i gotta go.

RACHEL:
 oh, wait, joshua! joshua!  yeah, well, that oughta do it. closing credits  marjorie starts talking in her sleep, awakening chandler. after a little bit, she quiets back down, and chandler tries to get back to sleep. there’s a short pause until she starts screaming, causing chandler to scream with her. she quickly calms down. this all wakes up joey, who comes over wearing the mouth guard, opens the top half of
