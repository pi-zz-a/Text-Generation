RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 she’s mad because i know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.

CHANDLER:
 i can check that for ya.

MONICA:
 i just—i can’t believe that you think that you and chandler know me and rachel better than we know you.

CHANDLER:
 well… we-we do. you can only eat tic tacks in even numbers.

JOEY:
 yeah, what’s that about?

CHANDLER:
  and you… ross, i believe, if you check rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.

ROSS:

MONICA:

MONICA:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 are you scared?

JOEY:
 no! all right, who-who makes up the questions?

MONICA:
 ross will do it.

ROSS:
 oh sure, "ross will do it!" it’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.

RACHEL:
 fine! we’ll ask phoebe.

ROSS:
 no-no-no, i-i wanna play.  

DR. ZANE:
 it looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.

PHOEBE:
 oh! i knew it! i knew it! i felt really thick this morning.

FRANK:
 well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.

DR. ZANE:
 okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.

PHOEBE:
 embryossss? as in, "more than one?"

DR. ZANE:
 um-hmm, five actually.

PHOEBE:
 five? okay, where am i giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?

DR. ZANE:
 we do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.

PHOEBE:
 that’s it! 25 percent? that means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!

FRANK:
 hey, y’know i was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?

ALICE:
 sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.

PHOEBE:
 okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause i’m-i’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.

FRANK:
 well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.

ALICE:
 umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. so, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.

PHOEBE:
 whoa!! that—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.  so, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that i can do y’know just to like help make sure i get pregnant?

DR. ZANE:
 no, i’m sorry.

PHOEBE:
 wow! you guys really don’t know anything!

FRANK:
 i know! why don’t you get drunk! that worked for a lot of girls in my high school. 

MONICA:
 you guys! do you realize that any minute now, phoebe can be pregnant?

JOEY:

RACHEL:
