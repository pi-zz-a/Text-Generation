phoebe: hey!
ross: hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
rachel: well, i’ve been up since six. thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
phoebe: you guys you really should get rid of those animals. they shouldn’t be living in an apartment.
rachel: yeah! especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
phoebe: all right. i’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if i’m ready to have frank and alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
ross: now, how will they know if you’re ready?
phoebe: oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
chandler: oh, i can uh, check that for ya.
phoebe: okay everyone, think thick.

phoebe: hi! wish me luck!
monica: oh, good luck.
joey: good luck.  and i’m still right!
monica: that is sooo not true!
rachel: what?
joey: she’s mad because i know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.
chandler: i can check that for ya.
monica: i just—i can’t believe that you think that you and chandler know me and rachel better than we know you.
chandler: well… we-we do. you can only eat tic tacks in even numbers.
joey: yeah, what’s that about?
chandler:  and you… ross, i believe, if you check rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
ross:  you’re good.  these are not.
rachel: i’m so not impressed. everybody snacks when they shop.
monica: yeah.
joey: oh yeah? ross, how many items left in that bag?
ross: five.
chandler: okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.

monica: yeah! and the winner gets a hundred bucks.
joey: serious?
monica: are you scared?
joey: no! all right, who-who makes up the questions?
monica: ross will do it.
ross:" oh sure, ""ross will do it!"" it’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own."
rachel: fine! we’ll ask phoebe.
ross: no-no-no, i-i wanna play.  
dr. zane: it looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
phoebe: oh! i knew it! i knew it! i felt really thick this morning.
frank: well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.
dr. zane: okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
phoebe:" embryossss? as in, ""more than one?"""
dr. zane: um-hmm, five actually.
phoebe: five? okay, where am i giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
dr. zane: we do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
phoebe: that’s it! 25 percent? that means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
frank: hey, y’know i was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
alice: sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.
phoebe: okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause i’m-i’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
frank: well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
alice: umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. so, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
phoebe: whoa!! that—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.  so, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that i can do y’know just to like help make sure i get pregnant?
dr. zane: no, i’m sorry.
phoebe: wow! you guys really don’t know anything!
frank: i know! why don’t you get drunk! that worked for a lot of girls in my high school. 
monica: you guys! do you realize that any minute now, phoebe can be pregnant?
