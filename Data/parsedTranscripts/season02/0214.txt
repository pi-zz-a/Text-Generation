 JOEY:
 well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? 

CHANDLER:
 ok, well that's the part where i'm a wank. but i was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.  hundred times, i promise i will never take it off my. . .   wrist. but if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.  

JOEY:
 you know what the. . .  

 CHANDLER:
 i am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. though you may haveth anger now. . .
