RACHEL:
 wow. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like the hobbit. 

MONICA:
 it is nothing like the hobbit. it's like reading about every relationship i've ever had, except for richard. 

 PHOEBE:
 oh yes, no, richard would never steal your wind. 

MONICA:
 no. 

PHOEBE:
 no, 'cause he's yummy. 

MONICA:
 yes. but all the other ones. 

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

 RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 hey. 

ROSS:
 uh, sweetie we've gotta go. 

RACHEL:
 no! 

ROSS:

 RACHEL:

ROSS:
 actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. so you don't miss the beginning. 

RACHEL:
 no, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind. 

 MONICA:
 you go girl. i can't pull that off can i? 

ROSS:

 RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ok, i just, i just really need to be with myself right now. i'm sorry. 

PHOEBE:
 um-um, um-um. 

RACHEL:
 you're right, i don't have to apologize. sorry. damnit!   

JOEY:
 what is it? 

 ROSS:
 i, i don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. i mean, i don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it. 

JOEY:
 see, this is why i don't date women who read. uh-oh. 

 ROSS:

JOEY:

JOEY:

 JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
