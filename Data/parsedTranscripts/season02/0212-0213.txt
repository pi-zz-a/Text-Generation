COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER:
 can't get the monkey off your back? then put it in your mouth...    

COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER:
 ...with monkeyshine beer.     

ROSS:
 that commercial always makes me so sad. 

JOEY:
 yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out ok. 

ROSS:
 i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel. 

PHOEBE:
 i can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.

MONICA:
 and the fact that they're both monkeys. 

ROSS:
 sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. 

RACHEL:
 oh, ross, you had to, i mean, he was humping everything in sight. i mean, i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. 

ROSS:
 remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. when i did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden i have this big attitude problem.  opening titles      

JOEY:
 hey, hey, check it out, guess what i got. 

CHANDLER:
 rhythm? 

JOEY:
 no, my first fan mail. 

ALL:
 alright! 

MONICA:
  you.' gosh. 'your not-so-secretive admirer, erica ford.' ooh wait, 'ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' 

RACHEL:
 ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. 

MONICA:
 this wasn't addressed to days of our lives, this is, this came to your apartment. there's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. 

JOEY:
 oh my god, i got my very own stalker.   

ROSS:
 hey guys. 

ALL:
 hey. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, where are you off to, travelin' jake? 

ROSS:
 well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in l.a. so i figured i'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel. 

CHANDLER:
 you know i think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.   

RACHEL:
 oh, phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, oh, ok, so everyone, pretend like i'm telling you a story, ok. and, and it's really funny. so everyone just laugh, now.   

PHOEBE:
 i know, i know.  

ROB:
 hi. i'm rob dohnen. 

PHOEBE:
 hi rob dohnen. 

ROB:
 i don't know anything about music, but i think you're really, really great. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, wow. 

ROB:
 anyway, i schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and i was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that i will write for them.    

JOEY:
 hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner? 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 hello. 

ERICA:
 it's erica. 

JOEY:
 ah, the stalker. 

ERICA:
 never mind, it's open. 

CHANDLER:
  might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon. 

JOEY:
 let's get out of here.   

CHANDLER:
 the one time they're not home. 

JOEY:
 ok, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.

CHANDLER:
 that's how radio stars escape stalkers. 

JOEY:
 she's comin'.   

ERICA:
 it's me. 

JOEY:
 uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. ready? 

CHANDLER:
 wait, wait, wait.     

ERICA:
 hi. 

JOEY:

LIPSON:
 hi, dean lipson, zoo administrator. i was told you had a question. 

ROSS:
 well, i uh, i can't seem to find the monkey i donated last year. he's a capuchan, answers to the name marcel. 

LIPSON:
 ahh, i'm afraid i have some bad news. marcel has passed on. 

ROSS:
 oh my god, what happened? 

LIPSON:
 well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. 

ROSS:
 i can't believe this. 

LIPSON:
 i'm sorry mr. geller. but ya know, there's an old saying, 'sometimes monkeys die.' it's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. 

ROSS:
 well, ya know, someone should have called me. 

LIPSON:
 i'm sorry. look, i know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. 

ROSS:
 zoo dollars? 

LIPSON:
 yes, and come see the bird show at 4. the macaws wear hats. well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.      

KIDS:
 ooohhh. 

PHOEBE:
 i know. 

MONICA:
 i can't believe joey's having lunch with his stalker. what i-, what is she like. 

CHANDLER:
 well, you remember cathy bates in misery? 

RACHEL AND MONICA:
 yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 well, she looks the exact opposite of that. 

RACHEL:
 and she's not crazy? 

CHANDLER:
 oh no no no, she's a total wack job. yeah, she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake remore. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god. 

MONICA:
 ah, and i mean, he's going out with her? he can not persue this. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. i mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? what're you lookin' at me for? he's the one who wants to boff the maniac. 

ROB:
 you ok? 

PHOEBE:
 no, uh-uh, i'm just, i'm nervous. so, you know what, maybe if i just, if i picture them all in their underwear. 

ROB:
 that's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. 

PHOEBE:
 i'm just, i'm, i'm, i'm used to playing for grown-ups. ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. this is a huge responsibility. what? are you gonna kiss me? 

ROSS:
 i was thinkin' about it. 

PHOEBE:
 ok.  

ALL:
 hi phoebe. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, um, i'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, ok.  now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. but lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, and last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. now, your mom and your dad said she moved to peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. la-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...   

ERICA:
 oh, drake, isn't it amazing? 

JOEY:
 yeah it is. . . what? 

ERICA:
 well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord. 

JOEY:
 yeah, that was a tricky one. in reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. 

ERICA:
 who's they? 

JOEY:
 no one. 

ERICA:
 oh drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh i could just eat them. . . but i won't. 

JOEY:
 good, otherwise my watch would fall off.  

ERICA:
 no, seriously. these hands. these miracle, magical, life-giving hands. oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one? 

JOEY:
 alright, just one.  that.   

WAITER:
 oh my god! someone, he's choking. is anyone here a doctor? 

ERICA:

JANITOR:
 it's about your monkey. it's alive.   

ERICA:
 i don't understand, why didn't you help that man? 

JOEY:
 uhh, cause, uhh, i'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. alright, look, i got to tell you something. 

ERICA:
 no, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. you don't have to explain yourself to me. ooh, who am i to question the great dr. drake remore? 

JOEY:
 but that's what... 

ERICA:
 i should just be happy to be near you. 

JOEY:
 hey i-  

ERICA:
 hey what? 

JOEY:
 that's it, just hey. like at the end of a dance, hey!  hey. he-hey.   

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

ROB:

PHOEBE:

ROB:

PHOEBE:
 but. 

ROB:
 how did you know there was a but? 

PHOEBE:
 i sense these things. it was either but or butter. 

ROB:
 the thing is, i think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals. 

PHOEBE:
 i can do that. 

ROB:
 really? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. 

ROB:
 because that would be fantastic. what? you wanna kiss me? 

PHOEBE:

JANITOR:

JANITOR:

ROSS:
 oh my god. but the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. 

JANITOR:
 the zoo! do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? 

ROSS:
 that, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. 

JANITOR:
 of course they're gonna say he's dead. they don't want the bad publicity. it's all a great big cover-up. do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? 

ROSS:
 that guy lipson? 

JANITOR:
 lipson knows. do you have any idea who else knows? 

ROSS:
 no, i, i only know lipson. 

JANITOR:
 hmm, lipson knows huh? ahh, hello mr. opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with... 

ROSS:
 buddy, my monkey, my monkey. 

JANITOR:
 word on the street - well, when i say street, i mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. 

ROSS:
 of course. 

JANITOR:
 your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. that's all i know. 

ROSS:
 this is unbelievable. 

JANITOR:
 so, what is this information worth to you, my friend? 

ROSS:
 are you trying to get me to bribe you? 

JANITOR:
 maybe. 

ROSS:
 but you already told me everything.   

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

VAN DAMME:

CHANDLER:

SUSIE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 hey joey i have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was marcel's trainer. he's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours. 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my aunt edna's, and there were three of us in there. 

SUSIE:

CHANDLER:

SUSIE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
