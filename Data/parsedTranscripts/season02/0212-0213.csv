commercial voiceover| can't get the monkey off your back? then put it in your mouth...    
commercial voiceover| ...with monkeyshine beer.     
ross| that commercial always makes me so sad. 
joey| yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out ok. 
ross| i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel. 
phoebe| i can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
monica| and the fact that they're both monkeys. 
ross| sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. 
rachel| oh, ross, you had to, i mean, he was humping everything in sight. i mean, i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. 
ross| remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. 
chandler| yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. when i did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden i have this big attitude problem.  opening titles      
joey| hey, hey, check it out, guess what i got. 
chandler| rhythm? 
joey| no, my first fan mail. 
all| alright! 
monica|  you.' gosh. 'your not-so-secretive admirer, erica ford.' ooh wait, 'ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' 
rachel| ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. 
monica| this wasn't addressed to days of our lives, this is, this came to your apartment. there's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. 
joey| oh my god, i got my very own stalker.   
ross| hey guys. 
all| hey. 
phoebe| ooh, where are you off to, travelin' jake? 
ross| well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in l.a. so i figured i'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel. 
chandler| you know i think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.   
rachel| oh, phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. 
phoebe| oh, oh, ok, so everyone, pretend like i'm telling you a story, ok. and, and it's really funny. so everyone just laugh, now.   
phoebe| i know, i know.  
rob| hi. i'm rob dohnen. 
phoebe| hi rob dohnen. 
rob| i don't know anything about music, but i think you're really, really great. 
phoebe| oh, wow. 
rob| anyway, i schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and i was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids? 
phoebe| oh, i would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that i will write for them.    
joey| hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner? 
chandler| well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.    
chandler| hello. 
erica| it's erica. 
joey| ah, the stalker. 
erica| never mind, it's open. 
chandler|  might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon. 
joey| let's get out of here.   
chandler| the one time they're not home. 
joey| ok, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
chandler| that's how radio stars escape stalkers. 
joey| she's comin'.   
erica| it's me. 
joey| uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. ready? 
chandler| wait, wait, wait.     
erica| hi. 
joey| erica.   
lipson| hi, dean lipson, zoo administrator. i was told you had a question. 
ross| well, i uh, i can't seem to find the monkey i donated last year. he's a capuchan, answers to the name marcel. 
lipson| ahh, i'm afraid i have some bad news. marcel has passed on. 
ross| oh my god, what happened? 
lipson| well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. 
ross| i can't believe this. 
lipson| i'm sorry mr. geller. but ya know, there's an old saying, 'sometimes monkeys die.' it's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. 
ross| well, ya know, someone should have called me. 
lipson| i'm sorry. look, i know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. 
ross| zoo dollars? 
lipson| yes, and come see the bird show at 4. the macaws wear hats. well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.      
kids| ooohhh. 
phoebe| i know. 
monica| i can't believe joey's having lunch with his stalker. what i-, what is she like. 
chandler| well, you remember cathy bates in misery? 
rachel and monica| yeah. 
chandler| well, she looks the exact opposite of that. 
rachel| and she's not crazy? 
chandler| oh no no no, she's a total wack job. yeah, she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake remore. 
rachel| oh my god. 
monica| ah, and i mean, he's going out with her? he can not persue this. 
chandler| hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. i mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? what're you lookin' at me for? he's the one who wants to boff the maniac. 
rob| you ok? 
phoebe| no, uh-uh, i'm just, i'm nervous. so, you know what, maybe if i just, if i picture them all in their underwear. 
rob| that's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. 
phoebe| i'm just, i'm, i'm, i'm used to playing for grown-ups. ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. this is a huge responsibility. what? are you gonna kiss me? 
ross| i was thinkin' about it. 
phoebe| ok.  
all| hi phoebe. 
phoebe| ok, um, i'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, ok.  now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. but lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, and last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. now, your mom and your dad said she moved to peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. la-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...   
erica| oh, drake, isn't it amazing? 
joey| yeah it is. . . what? 
erica| well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord. 
joey| yeah, that was a tricky one. in reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. 
erica| who's they? 
joey| no one. 
erica| oh drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh i could just eat them. . . but i won't. 
joey| good, otherwise my watch would fall off.  
erica| no, seriously. these hands. these miracle, magical, life-giving hands. oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one? 
joey| alright, just one.  that.   
waiter| oh my god! someone, he's choking. is anyone here a doctor? 
erica| well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of salem, dr. drake remore.   
janitor| meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes. 
ross| uhh, hey look, i don't really enjoy being with other men that way. but, um, zoo dollars? 
janitor| it's about your monkey. it's alive.   
erica| i don't understand, why didn't you help that man? 
joey| uhh, cause, uhh, i'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. alright, look, i got to tell you something. 
erica| no, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. you don't have to explain yourself to me. ooh, who am i to question the great dr. drake remore? 
joey| but that's what... 
erica| i should just be happy to be near you. 
joey| hey i-  
erica| hey what? 
joey| that's it, just hey. like at the end of a dance, hey!  hey. he-hey.   
phoebe|  when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . but don't. cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody that's another thing that you don't wanna do. 
monica| excellent! 
chandler| very informative! 
rachel| not at all inappropriate! 
phoebe| thank you for coming everybody. there're cookies in the back. 
rob| that was great, the kids loved you. 
phoebe| yay, i rock. 
rob| and you know why? because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.you were incredible. 
phoebe| but. 
rob| how did you know there was a but? 
phoebe| i sense these things. it was either but or butter. 
rob| the thing is, i think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals. 
phoebe| i can do that. 
rob| really? 
phoebe| yeah. 
rob| because that would be fantastic. what? you wanna kiss me? 
phoebe| thinkin' about it.   
janitor| ahh, the bat. ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. 
ross| buddy, my monkey? 
janitor| oh, yeah, right. there was a break-in, few months back, inside job. your monkey was taken. 
ross| oh my god. but the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. 
janitor| the zoo! do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? 
ross| that, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. 
janitor| of course they're gonna say he's dead. they don't want the bad publicity. it's all a great big cover-up. do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? 
ross| that guy lipson? 
janitor| lipson knows. do you have any idea who else knows? 
ross| no, i, i only know lipson. 
janitor| hmm, lipson knows huh? ahh, hello mr. opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with... 
ross| buddy, my monkey, my monkey. 
janitor| word on the street - well, when i say street, i mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. 
ross| of course. 
janitor| your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. that's all i know. 
ross| this is unbelievable. 
janitor| so, what is this information worth to you, my friend? 
ross| are you trying to get me to bribe you? 
janitor| maybe. 
ross| but you already told me everything.   
ross| check it out, he actually is the monkeyshine monkey. 
rachel| well, so what're you gonna do? 
ross| well, i guess i'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is. 
chandler| that's what i did when i lost my clydesdales. 
phoebe| ok, hi again. 
all| hi phoebe. 
phoebe| today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.  oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, and that's how we get hamburgers. nooowww, chickens!    
tv doctor| you're the only one who can save her drake.

joey| alright look, that's it. i don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. look, i know i should have told you this a long time ago but i am not drake remore, ok. i'm not even a doctor, i'm an actor. i just pretend to be a doctor. 
erica| oh my god. do the people at the hospital know about this? 
joey| somebody wanna help me out here? 
rachel| oh, i know, i know.  
erica| how, how can you be here and there. 
joey| 'cause it's a television show. 
erica| drake, what're you getting at? 
joey| i'm not drake. 
ross| that's right, he's not drake, he's hans remore, drake's evil twin. 
erica| is this true? 
rachel| yes, yes it is true. and i know this because, because he pretended to be drake to, to sleep with me.  
monica| and then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.   
chandler| and you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.  
erica| is all this true? 
joey| yes, i'm afraid it is. you deserve much better than me erica. you deserve to be with the real drake, he's the one you fell in love with. go to salem, find him, he's the guy for you. 
erica| oh hans.  
ross| hans...hans...yo evil twin. 
joey| right. goodbye erica, good luck in salem. take care 
erica| i'll never forget you hans.  
joey| ok, alright, the people who threw the water.   
phoebe| fired! why? 
rob| the library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs. 
phoebe| i can't believe it. did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth? 
rob| no. 
phoebe| i see. 
rob| maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs. 
phoebe| no. what do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur? 
rob| i'm not saying you have to be barney. 
phoebe| who's barney.

chandler| susie moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up. 
susie| it's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it. 
chandler| oh, right, well yeah, i graduated fourth grade and realized i wasn't a pimp. 
susie| remember the class play? you, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants. 
chandler| yes, back then i, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. thank god i don't do that anymore.   
monica| oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. 
rachel| what what what what?

monica| he could hear me. 
rachel| ok, i'm doin' it for ya. 
monica| oh rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. tell him i cook. 
rachel| excuse me. hi. 
van damme| hi. 
rachel| um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute. 
van damme| you don't think i'm cute? 
rachel| i, i don't know, um, do you think you're cute? ok, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. um, i was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. so what should i tell her? 
van damme| you can tell her i think her friend is cute.   
chandler| no, stephen hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, david stein was the guy who had no elbows. 
susie| ok, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating? 
chandler| ok that's not what he was doing. alright, he was looking for his bus money.   
susie| oh that's me, i gotta go. 
chandler| oh uh, o, ok. 
susie| um, so listen, how many times am i gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date. 
chandler| well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say ernie's, 8 o'clock. 
susie| i'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time i'll get to see your underwear. 
chandler| no one was around to hear that?   
monica| so what'd he say? 
rachel| agh, what a jerk. i kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. i mean, naturally, you know, i said no. 
monica| well, thanks anyway. 
rachel| he just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking. 
monica| rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do... 
rachel| jean-claude she said yes, i'll see you tonight. thank you.   
rachel| and then jean-claude took me to that place crossroads and that's where we hung out with drew barrymore. 
joey| oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh. 
rachel| does anybody need anything? 
monica| oh, i'll have an espresso. oh acutally, i'll get it. if i ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself. 
rachel| that is so unfair. 
phoebe| i know. oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with van damme.   
ross| hey joey i have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was marcel's trainer. he's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours. 
joey| you're blowin' me off for a monkey?

joey| yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.   
chandler| hey, stick a fork in me, i am done.

phoebe| well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell. 
chandler| ok, then, eat me, i'm done. 
chandler| i've met the perfect woman. ok, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'do you ever want to do it in an elevator?' 
monica| what did you say? 
chandler| ahh, i believe my exact words were, 'flaign,en - sten'. i mean i didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator? 
phoebe| oh, you just know.   
susie| oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes. 
chandler| oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what i had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops. 
susie| oh, 200 seconds of passion. we gotta go. 
susie| but um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear? 
chandler| well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my aunt edna's, and there were three of us in there. 
susie| well i was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner. 
chandler| you want me to wear your panties? 
susie| could ya? 
chandler| well, if i was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . you're swell.

phoebe| alright monica, if there is something that you would like to share... 
monica| ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
