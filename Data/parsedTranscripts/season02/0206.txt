 eight dollars and 27 cents. but not really, 'cause i put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better. 

RACHEL:
 do you? 

PHOEBE:
 no. this whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. you know, i don't know, when i sang "su-su-suicide", i got a dollar seventy-five. but then, "smelly cat", i got 25 cents and a condom. so you know, now i just feel really bad for smelly cat. 

RACHEL:
 well, you know, honey, i don't think everybody gets smelly cat. you know, i mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! 

PHOEBE:
 it's not even that. i used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money. 

RACHEL:
 well, people missed you in there. and in fact, there was actually a request for "smelly cat". 

PHOEBE:
 really? from who? 

RACHEL:
 well, from me. and i know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite. 

KID:
