 joey: well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? 
chandler: ok, well that's the part where i'm a wank. but i was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.  hundred times, i promise i will never take it off my. . .   wrist. but if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
