PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 phoebe, i thought your dad was in prison. 

PHOEBE:
 no, that's my stepdad. my real dad's the one that ran out on us before i was born. 

RACHEL:
 how have you never been on oprah? 

PHOEBE:
  before she died, same guy. 

MONICA:
 honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie. 

PHOEBE:
 it's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. ok, i have to talk to my grandmother.  

MONICA:
 oh, wait a minute honey. 

GANG:
 phoebs.  

MONICA:
 wow. 

JOEY:
 so anyway, i'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . . 

GANG:
 joey! 

JOEY:
 oh, but when phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!    

GRANDMOTHER:
 esther livingston.    

GRANDMOTHER:
 hi, phoe. 

PHOEBE:
 hi gram. whatcha doin'? 

GRANDMOTHER:
 oh, just updating the phonebook. 

PHOEBE:
 um, gram, um, can i see the pictures of my dad again? 

GRANDMOTHER:
  

PHOEBE:
 just, you know, to see... um. 

GRANDMOTHER:
 oh, sure, yeah.  in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, is this really my father? 

GRANDMOTHER:
 is it really your fa--i can't... well of course it is. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, i smell smoke. maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire. 

GRANDMOTHER:
 look, i. . . 

PHOEBE:
 ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. 

GRANDMOTHER:
 alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. 

PHOEBE:
 oh god. 

GRANDMOTHER:
 it was your mother's idea. ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, i didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. not impossible, but harder. 

PHOEBE:
 alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? and then, i guess, ok, he doesn't live in a hut in burma where there's no phones? 

GRANDMOTHER:
 last i heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, that makes no sense. why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? 

GRANDMOTHER:
 honey. 

PHOEBE:
  

GRANDMOTHER:
 anyway, that's all i know. that, and this.   this is the real him. 

PHOEBE:
 oh.    

CHANDLER:
 ya know i remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. he didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. 

RACHEL:
 well, that doesn't sound like a very merry christmas. 

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 oh, by the way mon, i don't think the mailman liked your cookies. here are the ornaments your mom sent.  

MONICA:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 well, not so good. upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math. 

GRANDMOTHER:
 well, i think you're better off without him. oh honey, i know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her gremlin. 

PHOEBE:
 no i just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know. 

GRANDMOTHER:
 i know. ok, i wasn't completely honest with you when i told you that, uh, i didn't know exactly where he lived.
