joey: i don't know.

susan: yeah, a woman i went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.

carol and susan: we love you. buy. 
ross: have a good time. ok, ben. 
monica: ross. 
ross: yeah. 
 monica: look.   joey, do you know we can see you from here? 
 joey: how come richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? 
ross: well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula. 
monica: you know what, i think it's cute, you trying to be more like richard. 
joey: not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.   
 ross: look it's the artist formerly known as chandler. 
chandler: just tryin' somethin' here, ya know. 
 monica: so joey, why didn't you grow a moustache? 
joey: oh we flipped for it. i got the cigar, he got the moustache. figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. 
ross: yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. 
chandler: hey listen, we've gotta go, i promised richard we'd meet him downstairs. 
monica: you're meeting richard? 
joey: yeah, we're goin' to a ranger game. 
chandler: yeah, didn't he tell ya? 
monica: well, he told me he was going out with the guys, i just didn't know that you were the guys. 
chandler: you hear that? we're the guys. 
joey: we're the guys. 
monica: with that moustache doesn't chandler remind you of aunt sylvia? 
ross: thank you.   
 ross: hi, we're visitiing. it's ben and his da-da. da-da. can you say da-da? look, i'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try. 
rachel: no luck huh? 
ross: naa. a while ago i got a sah out of him, which i thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause i, i gotta take this off. 
rachel: oh, yeah sure, ok.  
 ross: what're you doing? 
rachel: uh, i'm holding ben. 
ross: yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb. 
rachel: ok. 
 ross: well just hold him like you'd hold a football. 
rachel: this is how i would hold a football. 
ross: ok, here, here. there we go. 
rachel: ok, i'm sorry, i'm just not very good with babies. i mean i haven't been around them, i mean, you know, since i was one. 
ross: it's alright, it's no big deal. 
rachel: really? 
ross: yeah, definitely, i'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. 
rachel: what? 
ross: what? 
rachel: you think about stuff like that? 
ross: uhh, yeah. i mean, actually i kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. 
rachel: two, two babies? 
ross: yeah. ya know, a boy and a girl. hopefully the girl will come first so ben here won't feel too competitive. 
rachel: then what's gonna happen? 
ross: well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, scarsdale. 
rachel: uh-huh. 
ross: yeah, that way i figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. and yes, i know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. 
rachel: wow. wow, that's great. great. ok, wow, you know what. 
ross: huh? 
rachel: i'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this  gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. ok. oh look at that, i don't have a pot. i don't have a pot. well, hey, maybe i've got one at home, or in scarsdale. hey is that a door?    
phoebe: hey. 
richard: hey phoebs, what's happening? 
phoebe: oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the andes. 
monica: so you watched the movies huh? 
phoebe: uh huh, what is happening to the world? i mean, no no no, 'cause et leaves, and and rocky loses, charlotte dies. 
richard: charlotte who? 
phoebe: with the web, the spider she dies, she does. she has babies and dies. it's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud. 
monica: alright, you wanna feel better? 
phoebe: yeah. 
monica: ok, here, watch this. 
 phoebe: it's a wonderful life. yes i've heard of this. 
monica: so you can't lose, it's there in the title. wonderfullness is baked right in. 
phoebe: please, i almost fell for that with, uh, pride of the yankees, i thought i was gonna see a film about yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets lou gehrig's disease. 
richard: uh, the guy was lou gehrig. didn't you kinda see it coming? 
phoebe: phoebe, just watch that, i promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. 
 chandler:  
richard: hey, be right there. 
monica: there's a game? 
chandler: uh, yeah, i just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. bring your nerves of steel. 
richard: it's the basketball playoffs. 
monica: listen, um honey, i appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, i mean, they have each other. 
 richard: oh, no, honey, i mean, don't worry, i like hanging out with those guys. it's fun for me. they're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'you know who just died shoveling snow?' 
 monica: alright that's great, then just go. go knicks. 
richard: uh, it's the college playoffs. 
monica: oh, then go vassar. 
richard: uh, they're not in it. 
monica: ok, then just go. 
richard: ok.  
monica: oh, why does this bother me so much? i mean i don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them. 
phoebe: sure. 
 monica: it's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and i don't know, what do i do? 
phoebe: does it matter? you're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off. 
rachel:  
phoebe: me too.  
monica: i've got a question. richard made plans again with the guys. 
rachel: yeah well, ross just made plans for the whole century. 
 monica: ya know what, i think i'm gonna go to my room and read cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. know what, at least maybe i can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover cristmas candles. 
ross:  
rachel: i don't know, you tell me. one minute i'm holding ben like a football, the next thing i know, i've got two kids, i'm living in scarsdale complaining about the taxes. 
 ross: well i'm sorry, i think about stuff. ya know, i mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders. 
rachel: ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. 
ross: c'mon, what, you never think about our future? 
 rachel: yes, but i, i think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next saturday night. i do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. you know what our childrens names are gonna be. 
ross: no, no, i mean, ya know, i, i read a book and there was a girl named emily and i thought, i thought that might be good. 
rachel: what was the book? 
ross: the big book of childrens' names. 
rachel: ok, ross, ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. 
ross: yeah. 
rachel: but i do not want to have everything decided for me. i spent my whole life like that. it's what i had with barry, that was one of the reasons i left. i, i like not knowing right now and i'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that. 
ross: ok fine. 
rachel: thank you. 
ross: we're not done. 
rachel: i didn't know that. 
 ross: ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that. 
rachel: fine, i will. 
ross: good, 'cause i love you. 
rachel: oh yeah. 
ross: yeah. 
rachel: well i love you too. 
ross: well that's the first time we've said that. 
rachel: yes it is. 
ross: well, i'm gonna kiss you. 
rachel: well you better.   
 phoebe: hey. oh thanks for the great movie tip. 
monica: did you like it? 
phoebe: oh yeah. you know, i don't know if i was happier when um george bailey destroyed the family business or um, donna reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed. 
monica: alright, i'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful? 
 phoebe:" i didn't watch the ending, i was too depressed. it just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""it's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.""    "
chandler: kick save and... denied. 
 richard: but... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... bam! yes! could that shot be any prettier? 
joey: man you are incredible. 
 richard: well, we had a table in college. 
chandler: oh really, i didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's. 
 richard: nice moustache by the way. when puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in. 
monica:  table. 
richard: ok, just one more point. 
monica:  
chandler: see, that's why we don't let her play. 
richard: is everything all right? 
monica: um-hmm. 
richard: uh-oh. 
chandler: oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. i'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time. 
joey: yeah, he's just really great to hang around with. 
richard: well. 
 joey: no no, seriously, chandler and i were just talkin about this. he is so much cooler than our dads.  you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but richard is just- ow, ow. what are you kickin me for? huh? i'm tryin to talk here. 
richard: uh, you guys see me as a dad? 
joey: oh yeah. 
chandler: no. 
joey: nooooo. 
 chandler: your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. see, when we say dad, we mean buddy. we mean pal. 
richard: uh-huh, yeah. 
chandler: no no, seriously, joey's my dad, monica's my dad. i've even got some dads down at work. 
richard: that's fine. well, your other dad and i are gonna go have a romantic evening and i guess i'll just see you kids around. 
monica: nighty-nite. 
chandler: you're not a dad. you're not a dad. 
joey: not a dad. 
chandler: i can't believe you got us into trouble.   
monica:  
richard: yeah, just, i feel like i'm about a hundred. i thought i was just one of the guys. 
monica: come here. i'll make you feel like one of the guys. you know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball. 
richard: what're you talkin' about, i was killin' 'em. 
monica: yeah, well they suck too.   
 ross: ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail. 
rachel: ok ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter. 
ross:  
carol: it's us. 
ross: come on up. i'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.  
rachel: ok, we can do this now, can't we ben? yes we can, yes we can.   there. i did it. i did it. look at that, oh, stays on and everything. hi.
