 JOEY:

EVERYONE:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

 MONICA:
 hey, i made $17 before breakfast, what have you done? 

JOEY:
 well uh, i had breakfast here so technically i saved $3.50. 

RACHEL:
 how did you make $17. 

MONICA:
 well, my financially challenged friends,  i split my money and i bought some shares of chp and zxy. 

JOEY:
 how come those? 

MONICA:
 well, chp because i used to have a crush on eric estrada. and zxy becuase i think it sounds zexy. 

RACHEL:
 what happened to uh, meg.? 

 MONICA:
 meg was good for me but i dumped her. ya know, my motto is get out before they go down. 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 hey phoebs. oh hey, how's the dog? 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 oh, thank god. 

 PHOEBE:
 yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping. 

RACHEL:
 ok, so phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok? 

PHOEBE:
 i, i don't wanna meet my father over the phone.  what am i gonna say, like 'hi, i'm phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. oh, by the way, i broke your dog.' 

JOEY:
 hey phoebs, if you want, i'll do it. 

PHOEBE:
 ok. listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.   

 MONICA:
 don't...be too long with the phone. 

RACHEL:
 she'll be a much better friend when the market closes. 

JOEY:
  

PHOEBE:
 so talk to her. 

 JOEY:
  dog is. i want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. uh, goodbye.  

RACHEL:
