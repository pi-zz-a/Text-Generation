doctor| hello, there. i'm dr. carlin. i see someone's having an allergic reaction. 
monica| doctor, can i see you for just a minute please? my brother has a slight phobia about needles. 
ross| did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? 
monica| my brother, the phd would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.  
doctor| no, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. 
ross| tho?   
ross| ohhh. 
monica| that's good, have a seat. um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. you're just gonna have to be brave, ok? can you do that for me? 
ross| ok.

chandler| actually, uh, we're both the father.  
both | oh, ben! hey, buddy! 
chandler| please tell me you know which one is our baby. 
joey| well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. and ben was definitely wearing ducks. 
chandler| ok. 
joey| or clowns. oh, oh wait. that one's definitely ben. remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth. 
chandler| yeah? 
joey| yeah. 
chandler| hey, ben, remember us? ok, the mole came off. 
joey| ahh! 
chandler| what're we gonna do? what're we gonna do? 
joey| uh, uh, we'll flip for it. ducks or clowns. 
chandler| oh, we're gonna flip for the baby? 
joey| you got a better idea?  
chandler| all right, call it in the air. 
joey| heads. 
chandler| heads it is. 
joey| yes! whew! 
chandler| we have to assign heads to something. 
joey| right. ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.

rachel| hey. 
phoebe| oh, hi. 
rachel| here. i thought you might be cold. 
phoebe| thank you. 
rachel| whoa, look at you, you did pretty well. 
phoebe| eight dollars and 27 cents. but not really, 'cause i put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better. 
rachel| do you? 
phoebe|" no. this whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. you know, i don't know, when i sang ""su-su-suicide"", i got a dollar seventy-five. but then, ""smelly cat"", i got 25 cents and a condom. so you know, now i just feel really bad for smelly cat. "
rachel| well, you know, honey, i don't think everybody gets smelly cat. you know, i mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! 
phoebe| it's not even that. i used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money. 
rachel|" well, people missed you in there. and in fact, there was actually a request for ""smelly cat"". "
phoebe| really? from who? 
rachel| well, from me. and i know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite. 
kid| hi. uh, did i accidentally drop a condom in your case? it's kind of an emergency. 
phoebe| yeah. here you go. 
kid| thanks a lot. hey christine, i got it!

monica| remember it? what do you think this is, a freckle? 
ross| oh. 
monica| wait, what about the time i hit you in the face with the silvian's pumpkin? 
ross| oh, man. oh, remember when i stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?  
monica| no. but i remember people telling me about it. 
ross| i hope ben has a little sister. 
monica| yeah. i hope she can kick his ass. 
ross| i'm gonna get a new band-aid. hey, how 'bout the time i cut the legs off your malibu ken?
