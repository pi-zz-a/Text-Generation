JOEY:
 man this is weird. you ever realize captain crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat? 

CHANDLER:
 that's what's weird? joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.   

CHANDLER:
 waaa-aaah. 

JOEY:
 what? 

CHANDLER:
 the spoon. you licked and-and you put. you licked and you put. 

JOEY:
 yeah, so. 

CHANDLER:
 well don't you see how gross that is? i mean that's like you using my toothbrush.  

JOEY:
 well, that was only 'cause i used the red one to unclog the drain. 

CHANDLER:
 mine is the red one! oh god. can open, worms everywhere. 

JOEY:
 hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap? 

CHANDLER:
 because soap is soap. it's self-cleaning. 

JOEY:
 alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing i wash and the first thing you wash.  opening titles    

CHANDLER:
 hey. 

MONICA AND PHOEBE:
 hey. 

JOEY:
 hey. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, look at you fancy lads. what's the occasion? 

JOEY:
 well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? he's havin' a brunch. 

PHOEBE:
 ahh. 

RACHEL:
  

PHOEBE:
 okey-doke. 

MONICA:
 i can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos. 

CHANDLER:
 excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos? 

RACHEL:
 yes, but you can not tell ross 'cause i want to surprise him. 

JOEY:
 wow, this is wild. what're you gonna get? 

PHOEBE:
 um, i'm getting a lily for my mom. 'cause her name's lily. 

CHANDLER:
 wow, that's lucky. what if her name was big ugly splotch? 

JOEY:
 so where you gettin' it? 

PHOEBE:
 i think on my shoulder.  

ROSS:
 what? what's on your shoulder? 

PHOEBE:
 um, a chip. a tattoo, i'm getting a tattoo. 

ROSS:
 a tattoo? why, why would you want to do that?  

RACHEL:
 hi. well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool? 

ROSS:
 no, sorry i don't. tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? what if it doesn't come out right phoebe? then it's like, i don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. why's everyone staring at me? 

MONICA:
 ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. rich is gonna be here any minute. 

CHANDLER:
 oooh, rich is goin' to the party too, huh? 

MONICA:
 well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there. 

JOEY:
 oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two? 

MONICA:
 yeah. it's my dad's birthday, i decided to give him a stroke. 

PHOEBE:
 no, i think you should tell them. 

MONICA:
 no, i don't even know how serious he is about me. until i do, i'm not telling them anything. 

ROSS:
 i don't know, i don't think mom and dad would mind. remember when you were 9 and richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'god i hope they get together.'    

ROSS:
 alright, shall we? 

MONICA:
 ok, wait, wait, wait, wait. you know what? ross, let's - let's switch places. you get in the middle. no un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. 

ROSS:
 monica, monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.  

MRS. GELLER:
 oh hi kids. hi darling. 

MONICA:
 happy birthday dad. 

MR. GELLER:
 oh thank you. 

ROSS:
 hi ma. 

RICHARD:

MRS. GELLER:

ROSS:

FRIEND:
 well, you kids take the train in? 

MRS. GELLER:
 no, richard burke gave them a ride. 

FRIEND:
 oh. speaking of whom, i hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.  

MONICA:
 finger cramp. oh god, sorry. here, let me get that mom. 

MRS. GELLER:
 sooo, richard's shopping in the junior section. 

MONICA:
 are we still on that? 

MRS. GELLER:
 we just know she's got the iq of a napkin. 

FRIEND:
 she's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.    

JOEY:
 can you believe this place? 

CHANDLER:
 i know, this is a great apartment. 

JOEY:
 ah, i was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. so when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the rockettes. 

CHANDLER:
 wow, there's my fantasy come true. no, seriously. 

JOEY'S CO-STAR:
 hey. 

JOEY:
 hey! we were just sayin', great apartment man. 

JOEY'S CO-STAR:
 thanks. you want it? 

JOEY:
 huh? 

JOEY'S CO-STAR:
 yeah, i'm movin' to a bigger place. you should definitely take this one. 

JOEY:
 yeah, can you see me in a place like this? 

JOEY'S CO-STAR:
 why not? you hate park views and high ceilings? c'mon i'll show you the kitchen. 

CHANDLER:
  on tv. stop talking. ok.    

MR. GELLER:
 c'mon, tell us. 

FRIEND:
 yeah, is she really 20. 

RICHARD:
 i am not telling you guys anything. 

MR. GELLER:
 c'mon rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously. 

ROSS:
 dad, you really don't want to do that. 

MR. GELLER:
 ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends? 

RICHARD:
 jack, would you let it go? 

MR. GELLER:
 look, i know what you're going through. when i turned 50 i got the porsche. you... you got your own little speedster. 

RICHARD:
 guys. seriously, it is not like that. 

MR. GELLER:
 tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and i cou. . . 

ROSS:
 dad, i beg you not to finish that sentence. 

MR. GELLER:
 what? i'm kidding. you know i'd never let him touch the porsche.   

PHOEBE:
 ok rach, which, which lily? this lily or that lily? 

RACHEL:
 well i. . . 

PHOEBE:
 i like this lily. it's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. she had a more open, giving spirit. ooh, foghorn leghorn, ooh. 

TATTOO ARTIST:
 alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me. 

PHOEBE:
 here we go. 

RACHEL:
  

PHOEBE:
 you're not going? 

RACHEL:
 uh-huh. 

PHOEBE:
 what? is it - is this 'cause of what ross said? 

RACHEL:
 no. well, yeah, maybe. 

PHOEBE:
 i don't believe this. is this how this relationship's gonna work? ross equals boss. i mean, c'mon what is this, 1922? 

RACHEL:
 what's 1922? 

PHOEBE:
 just, you know, long time ago. well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. and then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. do you want to get this tattoo? 

RACHEL:
 yes i do, it's just that ross is. . . 

PHOEBE:
 ok, hey, hey. is your boyfriend the boss of you? 

RACHEL:
 no. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, who is the boss of you?!! 

RACHEL:
 you? 

PHOEBE:
 no. you are the boss of you. now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. go!!   

RICHARD:
 how ya doin'? 

MONICA:
 i'm a twinkie. 

RICHARD:
 really? i'm a hero. 

MONICA:
 oh, this is so hard. 

RICHARD:
 yeah, i know. i hate it too. look, maybe we should just tell them. 

MONICA:
 maybe we should just tell your parents first. 

RICHARD:
 my parents are dead. 

MONICA:
 god, you are so lucky. i mean, i mean. . . you know what i mean. 

RICHARD:
 i know, i know. just hang in there, ok. ok, i'll go out first, alright. 

MONICA:
 alright. 

RICHARD:
   judy, going to the bathroom, good for you. 

MRS. GELLER:
 thank you richard, i appreciate the support.    

MR. GELLER:
 honey. honey, have you seen my harmon kilerbrew bat? bob doesn't believe i have one. 

MRS. GELLER:
 i have no idea. did you know richard has a twinkie in the city? 

MR. GELLER:
 i know. he's like a new man. it's like a scene from cocoon. 

MRS. GELLER:
 i just never would have pictured richard with a bimbo. 

MR. GELLER:
 apparently, he told johnny shapiro that she's quite a girl. in fact, he told johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her. 

MRS. GELLER:
 really. 

MR. GELLER:
 i tell you, i've never seen him this happy. 

MRS. GELLER:
 so jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model? 

MR. GELLER:
 of course not. with you it's like i've got two 25-year-olds. 

MRS. GELLER:
  

MR. GELLER:
 c'mon, it's my birthday.    

JOEY:
 can we drop this? i am not interested in the guy's apartment. 

CHANDLER:
 oh please, i saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. you want it. 

JOEY:
 why would i want another apartment, huh? i've already got an apartment that i love. 

CHANDLER:
 well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while. 

JOEY:
 alright, you want the truth? i'm thinkin' about it. 

CHANDLER:
 what? 

JOEY:
 i'm sorry. i'm 28 years old, i've never lived alone, and i'm finally at a place where i've got enough money that i don't need a roommate anymore. 

CHANDLER:
 woah, woah, woah. i don't need a roommate either, ok? i can afford to live here by myself. ya know, i may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. 

JOEY:
 what're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? it's not like we agreed to live together forever. we're not bert and ernie. 

CHANDLER:
 look, you know what? if this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. 

JOEY:
 well that's how i feel. 

CHANDLER:
 well then maybe you should take it. 

JOEY:
 well then maybe i will. 

CHANDLER:
 fine with me. 

JOEY:
 great. then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.    

MR. GELLER:

MRS. GELLER:

RICHARD:

MRS. GELLER:

MONICA:

MR. GELLER:

PHOEBE:
