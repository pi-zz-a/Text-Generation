joey| man this is weird. you ever realize captain crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat? 
chandler| that's what's weird? joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.   
chandler| waaa-aaah. 
joey| what? 
chandler| the spoon. you licked and-and you put. you licked and you put. 
joey| yeah, so. 
chandler| well don't you see how gross that is? i mean that's like you using my toothbrush.  
joey| well, that was only 'cause i used the red one to unclog the drain. 
chandler| mine is the red one! oh god. can open, worms everywhere. 
joey| hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap? 
chandler| because soap is soap. it's self-cleaning. 
joey| alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing i wash and the first thing you wash.  opening titles    
chandler| hey. 
monica and phoebe| hey. 
joey| hey. 
phoebe| ooh, look at you fancy lads. what's the occasion? 
joey| well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? he's havin' a brunch. 
phoebe| ahh. 
rachel|  
phoebe| okey-doke. 
monica| i can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos. 
chandler| excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos? 
rachel| yes, but you can not tell ross 'cause i want to surprise him. 
joey| wow, this is wild. what're you gonna get? 
phoebe| um, i'm getting a lily for my mom. 'cause her name's lily. 
chandler| wow, that's lucky. what if her name was big ugly splotch? 
joey| so where you gettin' it? 
phoebe| i think on my shoulder.  
ross| what? what's on your shoulder? 
phoebe| um, a chip. a tattoo, i'm getting a tattoo. 
ross| a tattoo? why, why would you want to do that?  
rachel| hi. well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool? 
ross| no, sorry i don't. tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? what if it doesn't come out right phoebe? then it's like, i don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. why's everyone staring at me? 
monica| ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. rich is gonna be here any minute. 
chandler| oooh, rich is goin' to the party too, huh? 
monica| well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there. 
joey| oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two? 
monica| yeah. it's my dad's birthday, i decided to give him a stroke. 
phoebe| no, i think you should tell them. 
monica| no, i don't even know how serious he is about me. until i do, i'm not telling them anything. 
ross| i don't know, i don't think mom and dad would mind. remember when you were 9 and richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'god i hope they get together.'    
ross| alright, shall we? 
monica| ok, wait, wait, wait, wait. you know what? ross, let's - let's switch places. you get in the middle. no un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. 
ross| monica, monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.  
mrs. geller| oh hi kids. hi darling. 
monica| happy birthday dad. 
mr. geller| oh thank you. 
ross| hi ma. 
richard| happy birthday. 
mrs. geller| well, you kids thank dr. burke for the ride? 
ross| uh, actually mom, i think monica thanked him for the both of us.    
friend| well, you kids take the train in? 
mrs. geller| no, richard burke gave them a ride. 
friend| oh. speaking of whom, i hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.  
monica| finger cramp. oh god, sorry. here, let me get that mom. 
mrs. geller| sooo, richard's shopping in the junior section. 
monica| are we still on that? 
mrs. geller| we just know she's got the iq of a napkin. 
friend| she's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.    
joey| can you believe this place? 
chandler| i know, this is a great apartment. 
joey| ah, i was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. so when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the rockettes. 
chandler| wow, there's my fantasy come true. no, seriously. 
joey's co-star| hey. 
joey| hey! we were just sayin', great apartment man. 
joey's co-star| thanks. you want it? 
joey| huh? 
joey's co-star| yeah, i'm movin' to a bigger place. you should definitely take this one. 
joey| yeah, can you see me in a place like this? 
joey's co-star| why not? you hate park views and high ceilings? c'mon i'll show you the kitchen. 
chandler|  on tv. stop talking. ok.    
mr. geller| c'mon, tell us. 
friend| yeah, is she really 20. 
richard| i am not telling you guys anything. 
mr. geller| c'mon rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously. 
ross| dad, you really don't want to do that. 
mr. geller| ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends? 
richard| jack, would you let it go? 
mr. geller| look, i know what you're going through. when i turned 50 i got the porsche. you... you got your own little speedster. 
richard| guys. seriously, it is not like that. 
mr. geller| tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and i cou. . . 
ross| dad, i beg you not to finish that sentence. 
mr. geller| what? i'm kidding. you know i'd never let him touch the porsche.   
phoebe| ok rach, which, which lily? this lily or that lily? 
rachel| well i. . . 
phoebe| i like this lily. it's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. she had a more open, giving spirit. ooh, foghorn leghorn, ooh. 
tattoo artist| alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me. 
phoebe| here we go. 
rachel|  
phoebe| you're not going? 
rachel| uh-huh. 
phoebe| what? is it - is this 'cause of what ross said? 
rachel| no. well, yeah, maybe. 
phoebe| i don't believe this. is this how this relationship's gonna work? ross equals boss. i mean, c'mon what is this, 1922? 
rachel| what's 1922? 
phoebe| just, you know, long time ago. well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. and then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. do you want to get this tattoo? 
rachel| yes i do, it's just that ross is. . . 
phoebe| ok, hey, hey. is your boyfriend the boss of you? 
rachel| no. 
phoebe| ok, who is the boss of you?!! 
rachel| you? 
phoebe| no. you are the boss of you. now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. go!!   
richard| how ya doin'? 
monica| i'm a twinkie. 
richard| really? i'm a hero. 
monica| oh, this is so hard. 
richard| yeah, i know. i hate it too. look, maybe we should just tell them. 
monica| maybe we should just tell your parents first. 
richard| my parents are dead. 
monica| god, you are so lucky. i mean, i mean. . . you know what i mean. 
richard| i know, i know. just hang in there, ok. ok, i'll go out first, alright. 
monica| alright. 
richard|   judy, going to the bathroom, good for you. 
mrs. geller| thank you richard, i appreciate the support.    
mr. geller| honey. honey, have you seen my harmon kilerbrew bat? bob doesn't believe i have one. 
mrs. geller| i have no idea. did you know richard has a twinkie in the city? 
mr. geller| i know. he's like a new man. it's like a scene from cocoon. 
mrs. geller| i just never would have pictured richard with a bimbo. 
mr. geller| apparently, he told johnny shapiro that she's quite a girl. in fact, he told johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her. 
mrs. geller| really. 
mr. geller| i tell you, i've never seen him this happy. 
mrs. geller| so jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model? 
mr. geller| of course not. with you it's like i've got two 25-year-olds. 
mrs. geller|  
mr. geller| c'mon, it's my birthday.    
joey| can we drop this? i am not interested in the guy's apartment. 
chandler| oh please, i saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. you want it. 
joey| why would i want another apartment, huh? i've already got an apartment that i love. 
chandler| well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while. 
joey| alright, you want the truth? i'm thinkin' about it. 
chandler| what? 
joey| i'm sorry. i'm 28 years old, i've never lived alone, and i'm finally at a place where i've got enough money that i don't need a roommate anymore. 
chandler| woah, woah, woah. i don't need a roommate either, ok? i can afford to live here by myself. ya know, i may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. 
joey| what're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? it's not like we agreed to live together forever. we're not bert and ernie. 
chandler| look, you know what? if this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. 
joey| well that's how i feel. 
chandler| well then maybe you should take it. 
joey| well then maybe i will. 
chandler| fine with me. 
joey| great. then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.    
mr. geller| who's drink can i freshen? 
mrs. geller| almost time for cake. 
ross| mon, mon, are you ok?
