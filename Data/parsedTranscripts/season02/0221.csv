monica: really. 
 phoebe: ok, right there. that, that's the third sign today. right there. 
ross: on behalf of everyone, i'd just like to say behuh. 
 phoebe: no, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere i go today i keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. like when i was walking over here and i passed a buffet...which is my father's last name. 
everyone: ahh. 
phoebe: and they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. and there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken. 
monica: his indian name? 
phoebe: no because i chickened out the last time when i tried to meet him. so i mean coincidences? i don't think so.

joey: hey phoeb's, i think you're good to go. 
phoebe: yeah, i don't know. 
rachel: what's the matter? 
phoebe: i just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. i mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. it's just like, i have no family left, ya know. i mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. and i have a sister who i've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. i don't know, this is my real father and i just, i want things to be like just right. 
rachel: yeah phoebe, i completely understand. 
joey: yeah, whatever you need. hey, you wanna go home? 
phoebe: ok, thanks. sorry, again

monica: i wanna buy 5 shares of sgj and i wanna buy them now. c'mon time is money my friend. thank you. wooo. 
rachel: time is money my friend? 
joey: yeah, you missed, 'takes money to make money,' and uh, 'don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.' 
 monica: hey, i made $17 before breakfast, what have you done? 
joey: well uh, i had breakfast here so technically i saved $3.50. 
rachel: how did you make $17. 
monica: well, my financially challenged friends,  i split my money and i bought some shares of chp and zxy. 
joey: how come those? 
monica: well, chp because i used to have a crush on eric estrada. and zxy becuase i think it sounds zexy. 
rachel: what happened to uh, meg.? 
 monica: meg was good for me but i dumped her. ya know, my motto is get out before they go down. 
joey: that is so not my motto. 
phoebe:  
rachel: hey phoebs. oh hey, how's the dog? 
phoebe: ok, i talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and i can pick him up tomorrow. 
joey: good. 
rachel: oh, thank god. 
 phoebe: yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping. 
rachel: ok, so phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok? 
phoebe: i, i don't wanna meet my father over the phone.  what am i gonna say, like 'hi, i'm phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. oh, by the way, i broke your dog.' 
joey: hey phoebs, if you want, i'll do it. 
phoebe: ok. listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.   
 monica: don't...be too long with the phone. 
rachel: she'll be a much better friend when the market closes. 
joey:  
phoebe: so talk to her. 
 joey:  dog is. i want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. uh, goodbye.  
rachel: why the voice. 
joey:     
chandler: your cappucino sir. 
ross: thank you.   
chandler: ya know i think this is much better than the coffee house. 
ross: absolutely.   
 ross: how come it's not mixing with the water? 
chandler:well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.   
joey:  back from my neice's christening, i'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. no problem, joey's there. 
chandler: ok. 
ross: no.

chandler: alright, hang on a second there custer. 
joey: yeah really, ross, have you ever been beaten up before? 
ross: yeah, sure. 
joey: by someone besides monica?

phoebe: hi. 
 mrs buffay: schnoodle. oh my god, what the hell happened to my dog? 
phoebe: it was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. she's a vegetarian. 
mrs buffay: what are these, stitches? 
phoebe: yeah, eight of them. that's 56 to him. you know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.

frank: no but he didn't really talk about anything. 
phoebe: oh. 
frank: except stilts. 
phoebe: stilts? 
frank: yeah, he loved stilts. one time i was upstairs, i was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden i look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. he just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts. 
phoebe: wow. 
frank: yeah. 
phoebe: i don't know what to do with that. 
 frank: me neither. so you're like my big sister. 
phoebe: yeah. 
frank: this is huge, you can buy me beer. 
phoebe: i'm not gonna. but you know what's cool though? ok, if you had a friend named pete, then i could say, 'oh yeah, i know pete, he's friends with my brother.' 
frank: i gotta friend named mark. 
phoebe: that'll work too. 
frank: cool, alright. so maybe, ya know, i could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
