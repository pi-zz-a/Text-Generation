joey: i can't believe it's christmas already. ya know, i mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.

ross: uh, macy's, third floor, home furnishings. 
phoebe: this is my father, this is a picture of my dad. 
chandler: nah, phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame. 
phoebe: no it isn't, this is my dad, alright, i'll show you. 
rachel: phoebe, i thought your dad was in prison. 
phoebe: no, that's my stepdad. my real dad's the one that ran out on us before i was born. 
rachel: how have you never been on oprah? 
phoebe:  before she died, same guy. 
monica: honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie. 
phoebe: it's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. ok, i have to talk to my grandmother.  
monica: oh, wait a minute honey. 
gang: phoebs.  
monica: wow. 
joey: so anyway, i'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . . 
gang: joey! 
joey: oh, but when phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!    
grandmother: esther livingston.    
grandmother: hi, phoe. 
phoebe: hi gram. whatcha doin'? 
grandmother: oh, just updating the phonebook. 
phoebe: um, gram, um, can i see the pictures of my dad again? 
grandmother:  
phoebe: just, you know, to see... um. 
grandmother: oh, sure, yeah.  in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation. 
phoebe: ok, is this really my father? 
grandmother: is it really your fa--i can't... well of course it is. 
phoebe: ok, i smell smoke. maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire. 
grandmother: look, i. . . 
phoebe: ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. 
grandmother: alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. 
phoebe: oh god. 
grandmother: it was your mother's idea. ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, i didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. not impossible, but harder. 
phoebe: alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? and then, i guess, ok, he doesn't live in a hut in burma where there's no phones? 
grandmother: last i heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. 
phoebe: ok, that makes no sense. why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? 
grandmother: honey. 
phoebe:  
grandmother: anyway, that's all i know. that, and this.   this is the real him. 
phoebe: oh.    
chandler: ya know i remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. he didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. 
rachel: well, that doesn't sound like a very merry christmas. 
chandler: who said anything about christmas?   
monica: hi. 
ross: hey, anyone hear from phoebe yet? 
rachel: no, nothin'.

monica: you guys haven't gotten your presents yet? tomorrow's christmas eve, what're ya gonna do? 
chandler: don't you have to be claymation to say stuff like that? 
rachel: oh, by the way mon, i don't think the mailman liked your cookies. here are the ornaments your mom sent.  
monica: well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough. 
joey: monica, pigeons learn faster that you.  
ross: hey, rach, you know what? i think, i think i know what'll make you feel better. how 'bout you make a list about me. 
rachel: wha... forget it ross, no, i am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . . 
ross: c'mon rachel. 
rachel: ok, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. you like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. and, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair. 
ross: see there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what i said. 
rachel: yeah, and you know what? you're right, i do feel better, thank you ross.     
phoebe: yeah, um, in albany, can i have the number of frank buffay. . . ok, um, in ithica. . . alright, um, saratoga. . . oneonta. alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.    
grandmother: hey. 
phoebe: hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name. 
grandmother: c'mon now phoe, don't still be mad at me. how's it going? 
phoebe: well, not so good. upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math. 
grandmother: well, i think you're better off without him. oh honey, i know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her gremlin. 
phoebe: no i just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know. 
grandmother: i know. ok, i wasn't completely honest with you when i told you that, uh, i didn't know exactly where he lived. 
phoebe: whattaya mean? 
grandmother: he lives at 74 laurel drive in middletown. if you hit the dairy queen, you've gone too far. you can take my cab. 
phoebe: wow. thank you. 
grandmother: now, remember, nobody else drives that cab. 
phoebe: uh-huh, got it. ooh, i'm gonna see my dad. wish me luck, grandpa!     commercial

joey: hey, here she comes. 
chandler: hey.

ross: ok, tip the man. 
monica: no, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, i am not gonna be blackmailed. look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
