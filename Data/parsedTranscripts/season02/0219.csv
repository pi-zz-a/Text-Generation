phoebe| yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us goddesses. but you know who takes out wind? men, they just take it. 
rachel| men just take out wind? 
phoebe| ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers. 
rachel| wow. 
phoebe| yeah. 
rachel| well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like the hobbit. 
monica| it is nothing like the hobbit. it's like reading about every relationship i've ever had, except for richard. 
 phoebe| oh yes, no, richard would never steal your wind. 
monica| no. 
phoebe| no, 'cause he's yummy. 
monica| yes. but all the other ones. 
phoebe| oh yes. oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but god forbid we should take a sip. 
joey| anybody want a croan. 
 phoebe| ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. right there, it's like, um, 'hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'   
estelle| don't worry about it already. things happen. 
joey| so, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything? 
estelle| joey, look at me, look at me. do i have lipstick on my teeth?

estelle| look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. i already got you an audition for another world. 
joey| alright. cab driver number two? 
estelle| you're welcome. 
joey| but i was dr. drake remoray. how can i go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab? 
estelle| things change, roll with em. 
joey| but this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. i'm not gonna do this. 
estelle| joey, i'm gonna tell you the same thing i told al minser and his pyramid of dogs. take any job you can get and don't make on the floor. 
joey| i'm sorry. see ya.    
rachel| oh, god, oh, god, i mean it's just so. 
monica| isn't it. 
 rachel| uhh, i mean this is like reading about my own life. i mean this book could have been called 'be your own windkeeper rachel'. 
phoebe| i don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you. 
ross| hey you guys. 
monica| hey. 
ross| uh, sweetie we've gotta go. 
rachel| no! 
ross| no? 
 rachel| no, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table? 
ross| actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. so you don't miss the beginning. 
rachel| no, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind. 
 monica| you go girl. i can't pull that off can i? 
ross| excuse me, your, your, your wind? 
 rachel| yes, my wind. how do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow? 
ross| you, you know i, i don't, have a- have a problem with that. 
rachel| ok, i just, i just really need to be with myself right now. i'm sorry. 
phoebe| um-um, um-um. 
rachel| you're right, i don't have to apologize. sorry. damnit!   
joey| what is it? 
 ross| i, i don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. i mean, i don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it. 
joey| see, this is why i don't date women who read. uh-oh. 
 ross| what, what's that? 
joey| it's my visa bill. envelope one of two. that can't be good. 
ross| open it, open in. 
joey| oh my god. 
ross| woah. 
joey| look at this, how did i spend so much money? 
ross| uh joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due. 
joey| ahh. 
 ross| what, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari? 
joey| my animals. hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, i was all confused. i don't know what i'm gonna do. 
ross| well i guess you can start by drivin a cab on another world. 
joey| what? 
ross| that audition. 
joey| that's a two line part. 
 ross| joey, you owe $1100 at i love lucite. 
joey| so what. 
ross| so suck it up man, it's a job, it's money. 
joey| hey, look, i don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic. 
ross| toilet paper? 
joey| yeah. 
ross| look, i'm not being any of those things, ok, i'm just being realistic. 
joey| well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend. 
ross| i am your friend. 
 joey| well then tell me things like, 'joey you'll be fine,' and, 'hang in there,' and, and, 'somethin' big's fonna come along, i know it.' 
ross| but i don't know it. what i do know is that you owe $2300 at isn't it chromantic. 
joey| hey ross, i'm aware of what i owe. 
ross| ok, well then get some sense. i mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another. 
joey| look, i don't wanna hear this right now. 
ross| huh, i'm just saying... 
joey| well don't just say. 
ross| ya know, maybe, maybe i should just go. 
joey| ok. 
ross| ok. i'll see ya later. just think about it, ok. 
joey| i don't need to think about it. i was dr. drake remoray. that was huge. big things are gonna happen, you'll see. ross, you still there?    
eddie| hey pal.

chandler| look eddie, aren't you forgetting anything? 
 eddie| oh yeah, that's right, look i got us a new goldfish. he's a lot fiestier that the last one. 
chandler| maybe 'cause the last one was made by pepperidge farm. look eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now? 
eddie| well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now i'm a dehydrating maniac! 
chandler| look you have to help me out here. i thought we had a deal. i thought by the time... 
 eddie| ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?

casting guy| excuse me, that's 50 bucks. 
joey| what? 
casting guy| five oh dollars. 
joey| ohh, you know what it is? it's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. now when i was on days of our lives as dr. drake remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.  
casting guy| that's great. 
 joey| and, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', i could attend to the victims 'cause i have a background in medical acting. 
 casting guy| ok, listen, thanks for coming in. 
joey| no no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. uh, at least let me finish. uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. you were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. i'll have a good day.      
 phoebe| ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? i would have to say no.
