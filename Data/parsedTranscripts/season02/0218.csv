phoebe| uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy? 
chandler| no he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.

chandler| we don't need to remedy that. 
phoebe| oh yeah, it'll be fun.

phoebe| oh, ooh, soap opera digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests. 
joey| page 42, page 42, page 42. 
phoebe| ok, ok, ok. ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, days of our lives' joey tribbiani.' ooh, cool picture. 
joey| ooh, i look good. 
 phoebe| hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines? 
joey| uh, well, kinda yeah. like, remember last week when alex was in the accident? well the line in the script was, 'if we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' but i made it, ' if this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.' 
phoebe| ohh, ok, i see what you did there. aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this? 
joey| huh? never really thought about the writers. the scripts just kinda come to my house. but you know what? this makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?   
writer| makes up most of his lines. son-of-a-. yeah, well, write this jerkweed.   
joey| i fall down an elevator shaft? what the hell does this mean, i fall down an elevator shaft? 
delivery guy| uhh, i don't know, i just bring the scripts. 
joey| they can't kill me, i'm francesca's long lost son. 
 delivery guy| right. could you sign this? 
joey| no. no way, i'm not signing that. 
delivery guy| i don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show. 
joey| how can they do this to me? 
delivery guy| er, uh, i'm just gonna go. sorry.    
 monica| well it wasn't that many guys. i mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage. 
rachel| hey, it's not that big a deal, i was just curious. 
ross| g'night. 
richard| night richard. good luck mon. 
 monica| alright, before i tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with. 
richard| two. 
monica| two? two? how is that possible? i mean, have you seen you? 
richard| well, i mean what can i say? i, i was married to barbara for 30 years. she was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two. 
monica| two it is. ok, time for bed, i'm gonna go brush my teeth.  
 richard| woah, woah, no wait a minute now. c'mon it's your turn. oh c'mon. ya know, i don't need the actual number, just a ballpark. 
monica| ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.   
rachel| wow, i am so glad i'm not monica right now. 
ross| tell me about it. so what, what's your magic number? 
rachel| uhhhooo. 
 ross| c'mon, you know everyone i've been with. all, both of them. 
 rachel| well, there's you. 
ross| better not be doin' these in order. 
rachel| ok, uh, billy dreskin, pete carney, barry, and uh, oh, paolo. 
ross| oh yes, the weenie from torrini. 
rachel| oh honey, are you jealous of paolo? oh, c'mon, i'm so much happier with you than i ever was with him. 
ross| really? 
 rachel| oh please. that paolo thing was barely a relationship. all it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.   
chandler| eddie, i didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend. 
eddie| that's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say. 
chandler| this is nuts. this is crazy. she came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story. 
eddie| where's buddy? 
chandler| buddy? 
eddie| my fish, buddy. 
chandler| there was no fish when she dropped it off. 
eddie| oh, this is, this is unbelievable. i mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my buddy? 
 chandler| hey i didn't kill your fish. look eddie...  would you look at what i'm doin' here. that can't be smart. so we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in mr. pocket. tangellon?     
richard| that's it? that's the giant number you were afraid to tell me? 
monica| well yeah. 
richard| well, that's not bad at all. i mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet. 
monica| you really ok with it? 
richard| oh honey, i'm fine. 
monica| oh, yay. ok about that two. 
richard| what? alright, what about my two? 
monica| well, it just seems like a really small number. 
richard| right, and... 
monica| and, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? or is that what you're doing with me? oh my god, am i an oat? 
richard| honey, you are not an oat. i, i mean i don't know, i, i guess i'm just not an oat guy. i've only slept with women i've been in love with. 
monica| but you've only slept with two people. 
richard| right. 
monica| wow. oh wow. you know i love you too, right. 
richard| now i do.    
 rachel| ross, ross, please listen to me. ross, you are so much better for me than paolo ever was. i mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh. 
ross| oh, hey, if i make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and i'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes. 
rachel| god, ross, look, what you and i have is special, all paolo and i ever had was... 
 ross| animal sex, animal sex? so what're you saying, i mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. i mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex? 
rachel| ok, ross, try to hear me. ok, i, hey, i'm not gonna lie to you. ok, it was good with paolo. 
ross| knock-knock. 
rachel| but, what you and i have is so much better. ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. ya know, i swear, this is the best i have ever had. 
ross| until now.    
rachel| oh, hi. 
monica| hi. richard just told me he loves me. 
rachel| oh my god, honey that's great. 
monica| i know. i just can't find... 
rachel| oh they're in the top drawer. hurry.

rachel| honey. 
ross| what, what oh....

 monica| it's not gonna happen. they're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow. 
richard| uh, in the future, if i could see the schedule beforehand...   
chandler| so, when i woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes. 
monica| why? 
chandler| because he thinks i slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. 
 phoebe| why would you kill his fish? 
chandler| because sometimes, phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish. 
rachel| chandler honey, i'm sorry. ok, can we watch joey's show now please?   
ross| yeah. 
monica| wait, he's not here yet.

rachel| well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back. 
 joey| naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin. 
 phoebe| but joey, you're gonna be fine. you don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera. 
joey| phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. 
phoebe| yes, i was going to incorporate that. oh good, here's monica, she'll have something nice to say. 
monica| um, i straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. what? to me that's nice. 
chandler| it's gonna be ok. you know that? 
joey| no, i don't. it's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. but this so was. ya know, it changed everything. like the other day, i got this credit card application, and i was pre- approved. huh? i've never been pre-approved for anything in my life. 
chandler| i'm sorry man. 
 rachel| yeah, joey honey, i don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
