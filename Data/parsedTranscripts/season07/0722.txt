ROSS:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey uh mon, i saw the porsche parked out front, can i get the keys? thought i’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.

RACHEL:
 wait a minute!  you let ross drive the porsche and when i ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.

MONICA:
 yeah, well he’s my brother! and plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.

ROSS:
 it’s a car monica! not a rocket ship!

MONICA:
 whatever ross! just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.

JOEY:
  hey!

ROSS:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 saw the porsche out there mon, lookin’ good. when do i get to take that baby out again?

RACHEL:
  you let joey drive it?!

PHOEBE:
 i’ve never driven it! okay? not once! okay once. okay, i drive it all the time.

MONICA:
 nice work everybody! so much for the y’know, "you can drive it, but don’t tell rachel" plan!

RACHEL:
 wow! i can’t believe you lied to me.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i can fix this! okay monica, rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. 

MONICA:
 great! well rachel, the reason why i won’t let you drive the porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. there! that wasn’t about the wedding.

ROSS:
 look rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the porsche i’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.

JOEY:
 yeah, you got a couple hours? opening credits  

ROSS:
 whew! that was a brisk ride!

RACHEL:
 take the top down did ya?

ROSS:
 only way to fly. 

RACHEL:
 come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what she’s talking about! i am an excellent driver!

ROSS:
 you’re fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver.

RACHEL:
 well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader. 

ROSS:
 did you see the look that girl just gave me? huh? she must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.

RACHEL:
 i think she’s checking out your beehive ross.

ROSS:
 what?!  give-give me a brush.

RACHEL:
 gimme the keys!

ROSS:
 no way!

RACHEL:
 well no brush!

ROSS:
 fine! y’know what? it doesn’t matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.  (he goes to the bathroom and after he leaves rachel goes through his coat and grabs the keys along with a $20 bill. the woman from before watches her do this.)

RACHEL:
   

MONICA:
 chandler, we still haven’t gotten an rsvp from your dad.

CHANDLER:
 oh! right. umm, maybe that’s because i didn’t send him an invitation.

MONICA:
 chandler! he’s your father; he should be at the wedding.

CHANDLER:
 i don’t even know the man. okay? we’re not the close. i haven’t seen him in years.

MONICA:
 well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!

CHANDLER:
 well he doesn’t have to know! it’s not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, i think i wanna trade circles.

CHANDLER:
 trust me, you don’t want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.

MONICA:
 so what! as long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil i don’t care.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i think i need to do some shopping.  

RACHEL:
 ahhh!  ooh, nice! 

RACHEL:
 my god!

ROSS:
 what do you think you’re doing?!

RACHEL:
 just washing the windshield. (she turns on the wipers forcing ross off of the hood.)

ROSS:
 there is no way i am letting you drive this car! so why don’t you just hand over the keys?

RACHEL:
 oh.

{TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE:
 she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? it’s a tradition left over from porsche’s racing history. the world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday.  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. the driver’s left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. that’s why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}

ROSS:
 no ah-ah-ah! do not start this car!  okay! okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (he looks for the twenty rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)

RACHEL:
 look ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!

ROSS:
 with you?! yeah right!

RACHEL:
 all right. 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 what are you doing?! get in the front!

ROSS:
 in the death seat?!!

RACHEL:
 oh my…  

MAN:
 hey guys!

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey sweetie!

MAN:

PHOEBE:
 yeah! sure! ooh, i left my purse up at monica’s. i’ll be right back. 

MAN:
  wait a minute!

PHOEBE:
 what?  ooh. 

JOEY:
 so! you and phoebe huh? how long have you been going out?

MAN:
 over a month.

JOEY:
 wow! maybe uh, maybe you and i ought to get to know each other a little better.

MAN:
 sure, i’d like that.

JOEY:
 so uh, what’s your name?

MAN:
  its jake.

JOEY:
 joey.  hey jake, do you like the knicks?

JAKE:
 yeah, big fan.

JOEY:
 me too! there’s a game on tuesday do you wanna go?

JAKE:
 yeah that would be great! let me make sure i’m not doing anything tuesday. (he bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt revealing a pink lace secret.)  

MONICA:
 here! 

CHANDLER:
 what’s this?

MONICA:
 it’s your suitcase. we’re going to las vegas.

CHANDLER:
 are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! no more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—think of the money we’ll save!!  we’re not eloping. i love the flowers. can our wedding be bigger please?

MONICA:
 we’re going to las vegas to see your dad. it’s time you two talked, and i want to get to know my father-in-law.

CHANDLER:
 y’know we already went over this and i won!

MONICA:
 no you didn’t. oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.

CHANDLER:
 look forget it okay? i don’t want to go. i don’t want to see him. i don’t wanna.

MONICA:
 chandler, look i-i know that your dad embarrassed you. i know…

CHANDLER:
 no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. you’re skinny. you’re wearing speedoes—that your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!

MONICA:
 hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! okay? that’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.

CHANDLER:
 he had sex with mr. girabaldi!

MONICA:
 who’s mr. girabaldi?

CHANDLER:
 does it matter?!

MONICA:
 chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. if your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.

CHANDLER:
 yeah o-okay, but i’m just doing this for you.

MONICA:
 yes!

CHANDLER:
 so i really never get to win anymore?

MONICA:
 how much did ever really win before? 

JOEY:
 pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear?

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

JOEY:
 well, when jake did it i saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!

PHOEBE:
 i know. they were mine.

JOEY:
 oh.  no! no wait, that’s weird!

PHOEBE:
 no, it’s not! we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on.

JOEY:
 that’s weird!

PHOEBE:
 i’m wearing his briefs right now.

JOEY:
 that’s…kinda hot.

PHOEBE:
 i think so too. and that little flap? great for holding my lipstick.

JOEY:
 yeah, i wouldn’t know about that.

PHOEBE:
 and! y’know what jake says? that women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.

JOEY:
 yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!

PHOEBE:
 there is nothing wrong with jake! okay? he is all man! i’m thinking even more than you.

JOEY:
 oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.

PHOEBE:
 i’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! i don’t think you could ever do that.

JOEY:
 hey! i am secure with my masculinity.

PHOEBE:
 okay whatever.

JOEY:
 you’ve seen my huge stack of porn right?   

RACHEL:
 god. i forgot how much i love driving. i have got to get my license renewed.

ROSS:
  you don’t have a valid driver’s license—okay that is it! pull over right now!

RACHEL:
 oh ross you’re so tense! you just gotta relax okay? just need to relax all right? just need to relax… 

ROSS:
  what-what are you doing?! are you—okay that’s not funny! just stop horsing around!

RACHEL:
 i am not horsing around okay? i am porsching around. 

RACHEL:
 uh-oh. 

ROSS:
 okay, stay calm. nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.

RACHEL:
 really? you think so?

ROSS:
 i was talking to myself! you’re going down!  past a pile of rachel’s laundry, which just happens to include a selection of panties. he stops, goes back to the basket, looks for rachel, picks up a lavender thong, and heads for his bedroom. however, he decides he doesn’t like his selection and goes back this time picking up a red low-cut silk brief and heads for his room, flexing along   arrive at 4 queens bar, where chandler and monica are sitting at a table waiting for the show to start.

A WAITER IN DRAG:

MONICA:
 uh oh yeah, she did. uh, he did.  i’m-i’m sorry i’m new. i don’t…

WAITER IN DRAG:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i just ordered a beer! 

WAITER IN DRAG:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 no! no! i don’t want him to know we’re yet! i’m not sure i’m ready for that. and besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.

MONICA:
 why not?!

CHANDLER:
 i don’t know if i’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years

MONICA:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to new york, but i always said i was too busy to see him. y’know it’s all very cats in the cradle—i don’t want to get into it.  here we go.
