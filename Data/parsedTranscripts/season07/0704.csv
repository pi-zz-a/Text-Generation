mac|  well, if we learned one thing today c.h.e.e.s.e. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don’t mix. (cut to joey laughing while rachel, chandler, and monica aren’t amused.)

mac| well, i couldn’t have done it without you buddy. you’re a genius.
c.h.e.e.s.e| oh yeah? well then how come i can’t get my vcr to stop
blinking 12|00? (they both break into a huge laugh and do that stop motion thing they had at the end of chips.)
joey|  so, what did you guys think? (they all make happy faces as they are unable to express their feelings verbally. finally, the phone rings and the race to answer it is won by monica.)
monica|  hold on please. joey, it’s your mom. 
chandler| it’s your mommy. it’s your mommy.
ross| ohhhh…
rachel| that’s nice.
joey|  mom, so what did you think? (he walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they’re gonna say.)

hilda| what?
rachel| i’ve never interviewed anyone before. i’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. although when i was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing. 
hilda| no dear. it’s not.
rachel| no. yeah, and i know that. all right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
hilda| thank you! good meeting you.
rachel| all right.  i’m a total pro!

rachel|  wow! h-umm! hi! yes, uh i’m sorry the models are actually down the hall.
man| actually, i’m here about the assistant job.
rachel| really?!  okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?
man| tag jones.
rachel| uh-huh, go on.
tag| that’s it. that’s my whole name.
rachel| that’s your whole name, okay of course it is! okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. 
tag| i know i haven’t worked in an office before, and i really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh…
rachel| oh come on, what are you talking about? you’ve got three years painting houses. two whole summers at t.g.i. friday’s, come on!
tag| it’s lame, i know. but i’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn…
rachel| okay, hold on just a second. (she grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) i’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. could you just stand up please?  
chandler| no-no-no-no. (waves him away as monica and phoebe enter whispering to each other.) hey! 
phoebe|  anyway, i should go. okay, bye.
monica|  hey sweetie.
chandler| hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?
monica| i can’t tell you. it’s a secret.
chandler| secret? married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.
monica| awww.  but still no.
chandler| no i’m serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you.
monica| really? okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to ross junior year at disneyland?
chandler| oh no-no, i can’t do that.
monica| if you tell me, i’ll tell you what phoebe said.
chandler| okay.
monica| okay.
chandler| so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, we’re on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.
monica| oh my god. he threw up?
chandler| no, he visited a little town south of throw up. (monica laughs hysterically.) so what was phoebe’s secret?
monica| oh, nancy thompson from phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.
chandler| that’s it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?
monica| that’s right! you lose sucker!!  please still marry me. 
rachel| chandler, you have an assistant right?
chandler|  did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!
rachel| no, i-i just don’t know how you decide who to hire. i mean i’ve got it narrowed down to two people. one of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…
chandler| what about him?
rachel| i love him. he’s so pretty i wanna cry! i don’t know what to do. tell me what to do.
phoebe| come on you know what to do! you hire the first one! you don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.
rachel| uh-huh. no, i hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can i just say one more thing?  look how pretty!
phoebe| let’s see.  oh my god! oh… but no! no! you can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. umm, this is for me 
rachel| okay you’re right. i’ll hire hilda tomorrow. dumb old perfect for the job hilda!
chandler| let me see this guy.  w-h-wow! don’t show this to monica! and don’t tell her about the w-h-wow!

terry| why would you think that?
joey| well, i was dr. drake remoray, stryker’s twin brother. i mean, who looks more me than me right?
terry| everybody has to audition.
joey| y’know terry, i-i don’t really need to do this. i got my own cable tv series,  with a robot.
terry| i’m sorry joey that’s…that’s the way it is.
joey| well. i guess you think you’re pretty special huh? sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? well y’know what?  this is one star who’s hoop… this is a star that the hoop—this hoop—i was dr. drake remoray!

ross| uhh, those are tacos.
monica| excuse me mr. mexico.
ross| eh, either way i’ll pass.  i still can’t eat those.  what’s so funny?!
monica|  i’m not laughing.  
ross|  you told her!
chandler| nancy thompson’s getting fired! (monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
ross|"  look, okay-okay i had food poisoning! it’s not like i choose to do it! it’s not like—it’s not like i said, ""umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"""
monica| you’re right. i mean i’m sorry. yeah, i shouldn’t be laughing. i should be laying down papers for you! (runs off laughing which gets chandler laughing.)
ross|  how could you tell her?!
chandler| i had too okay?! we’re getting married! married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
ross| oh really? well i-i guess monica should know about atlantic city.
chandler| du-ude!
monica|  what happened in atlantic city?!
ross| well, chandler and i are in a bar…
chandler|" did you not hear me say, ""du-ude?!"""
ross| and this girl is making eyes at chandler, okay? so after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing. now, i know what you’re thinking, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
monica|  you kissed a guy?!! oh my god.
chandler| in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
ross| oh mon, i laughed so hard…
chandler| ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
ross| whatever dude, you kissed a guy. commercial break 
rachel| hi!

phoebe| sorry.
rachel| i’m sorry joey.
joey| why would they do that?! it was a good show right?! (phoebe and rachel both pause, look at each other, and go press their breasts against him. which joey doesn’t mind, of course.)  
chandler| you wanna tell secrets?! okay! okay! in college, ross used to wear leg warmers!
ross| all right! all right! chandler entered a vanilla ice look-a-like contest and won!
chandler| ross came in forth and cried!
monica| oh my god! 
ross| oh, is that funny?! oh, you-you find that funny?! well maybe chandler should know some of your secrets too!
monica| i-i already told him everything!  you shush!!
ross| once monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.
monica| ross used to stay up every saturday night to watch golden girls!
ross| monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
monica| it’s hard for some people!
chandler|  wow—whoa!
monica| chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
chandler| hey!!!

joey| how could this happen to me?! yesterday i had two tv shows! today, i got nothin’!
rachel| well wait a minute, what happened to days of our lives?
joey| uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
phoebe| what happened?

chandler|  you have no trouble telling time now right?
monica| no!
chandler| quick! what time is it?! 
monica| i don’t know! time to kiss a guy maybe?!  what are you laughing at pampers? 
chandler| y’know when i said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets? 
monica| yeah?
chandler| yeah that was stupid. let’s not do that.
monica| ohh, absolutely.
ross| and! we should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
monica| yeah, definitely!
ross| okay,  if you’ll excuse me, i-i’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the space mountain story.
monica| then, i’d steer clear of phoebe.
ross| man!
