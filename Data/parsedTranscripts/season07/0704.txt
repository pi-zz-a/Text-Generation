MAC:

RACHEL:
 that’s your whole name, okay of course it is! okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. 

TAG:
 i know i haven’t worked in an office before, and i really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh…

RACHEL:
 oh come on, what are you talking about? you’ve got three years painting houses. two whole summers at t.g.i. friday’s, come on!

TAG:
 it’s lame, i know. but i’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn…

RACHEL:
 okay, hold on just a second. (she grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) i’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. could you just stand up please?  

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no. (waves him away as monica and phoebe enter whispering to each other.) hey! 

PHOEBE:
  anyway, i should go. okay, bye.

MONICA:
  hey sweetie.

CHANDLER:
 hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?

MONICA:
 i can’t tell you. it’s a secret.

CHANDLER:
 secret? married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.

MONICA:
 awww.  but still no.

CHANDLER:
 no i’m serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you.

MONICA:
 really? okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to ross junior year at disneyland?

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no, i can’t do that.

MONICA:
 if you tell me, i’ll tell you what phoebe said.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, we’re on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.

MONICA:
 oh my god. he threw up?

CHANDLER:
 no, he visited a little town south of throw up. (monica laughs hysterically.) so what was phoebe’s secret?

MONICA:
 oh, nancy thompson from phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.

CHANDLER:
 that’s it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?

MONICA:
 that’s right! you lose sucker!!  please still marry me. 

RACHEL:
 chandler, you have an assistant right?

CHANDLER:
  did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!

RACHEL:
 no, i-i just don’t know how you decide who to hire. i mean i’ve got it narrowed down to two people. one of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…

CHANDLER:
 what about him?

RACHEL:
 i love him. he’s so pretty i wanna cry! i don’t know what to do. tell me what to do.

PHOEBE:
 come on you know what to do! you hire the first one! you don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh. no, i hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can i just say one more thing?  look how pretty!

PHOEBE:
 let’s see.  oh my god! oh… but no! no! you can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. umm, this is for me 

RACHEL:
 okay you’re right. i’ll hire hilda tomorrow. dumb old perfect for the job hilda!

CHANDLER:

TERRY:

JOEY:

TERRY:

JOEY:

TERRY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
  look, okay-okay i had food poisoning! it’s not like i choose to do it! it’s not like—it’s not like i said, "umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"

MONICA:
 you’re right. i mean i’m sorry. yeah, i shouldn’t be laughing. i should be laying down papers for you! (runs off laughing which gets chandler laughing.)

ROSS:
  how could you tell her?!

CHANDLER:
 i had too okay?! we’re getting married! married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!

ROSS:
 oh really? well i-i guess monica should know about atlantic city.

CHANDLER:
 du-ude!

MONICA:
  what happened in atlantic city?!

ROSS:
 well, chandler and i are in a bar…

CHANDLER:
 did you not hear me say, "du-ude?!"

ROSS:
 and this girl is making eyes at chandler, okay? so after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing. now, i know what you’re thinking, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.

MONICA:
  you kissed a guy?!! oh my god.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 i’m sorry joey.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 you wanna tell secrets?! okay! okay! in college, ross used to wear leg warmers!

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 ross used to stay up every saturday night to watch golden girls!

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 yeah, definitely!

ROSS:
 okay,  if you’ll excuse me, i-i’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the space mountain story.

MONICA:
