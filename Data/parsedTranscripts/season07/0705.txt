CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 that’s not true, there are great pictures of us!

CHANDLER:
 no, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this… (makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. henceforth, this shall be known as the face.)

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! that’s the creep that you’re with at the statue of liberty.

CHANDLER:
 i don’t know what it is, i just can’t take a good picture.

MONICA:
  oh, here’s a great one.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i’m not in that.

MONICA:
 i know, but look at me all tan.

PHOEBE:
 hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.

MONICA:
 that’s a good idea! i bet they have one of those wind machines! y’know… 

PHOEBE:
 yeah that’s great! next to that, chandler won’t look so stupid.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 hey, i thought that guy was married.

PHOEBE:
 he is! but he’s getting divorced—ross! maybe you know him.

ROSS:
 it’s not a club.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?

ROSS:
 hey, divorced men are not bad men!

CHANDLER:
 they have that on the napkins at the club.

RACHEL:
 oh, i gotta get back to work.

PHOEBE:
 you don’t have to be back for a half-hour!

RACHEL:
 yeah but, my assistant tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. ohh! i could just spread him on a cracker.

CHANDLER:
 rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? i mean y’know you can’t date him right?

RACHEL:
 oh no, i know that. i know that. although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.

ROSS:
 soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.

RACHEL:
 i am not gonna get fired, because i’m not gonna act on it.

PHOEBE:
 so you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?

RACHEL:
 why? is he? he is! isn’t he? he’s dating that slut in marketing!

ROSS:
 maybe i should open a divorced men’s club.

CHANDLER:
 dude that is so sad.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 could i play?  

RACHEL:
 oh, no sit-ups today tag?

TAG:

RACHEL:

TAG:

RACHEL:

MELISSA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 i know. let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come.  chandler! what is the matter with your face?! i mean this picture is supposed to say "geller and bing to be married," not "local woman saves drowning moron!"  hey! don’t laugh at him! he’s my drowning moron!

CHANDLER:
 aww! 

MONICA:
 that’s it! take it! take it! take it!  

ROSS:

MONICA:
 they can’t all be bad.  find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. ohh, there it is.

CHANDLER:
 oh my god! those are my bedroom eyes?! why did you ever sleep with me?

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

HUMS WHILE HE PEES:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

HUMS WHILE HE PEES:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 well look-look, okay ross, kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 okay.

PHOEBE:
 and! she uses sex as a weapon!

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 pheebs come on! i mean, consider the source! of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. now, if you’ll excuse me…

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 y’know, all the women.

JOEY:
 hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. y’know, that’s why i never had any luck with chandler.

CHANDLER:
  i’m right here!

RACHEL:
 all right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—and i know he’s my assistant and i can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 i’m still right here!

RACHEL:
 all right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!

JOEY:
  what?!

RACHEL:
 i just don’t want him to meet anybody until i am over my crush—and i will get over it. it’s-it’s not like i love him, it’s just physical! but—i mean i get crushes like this all the time! i mean hell, i had a crush on you when i first met ya!

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
  

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 hi.

PHOEBE:
 so, how are things going with crazy? has she cooked your rabbit yet?

ROSS:
 listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and f.y.i she must’ve shown kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! and his response to each one was, "i don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."

PHOEBE:
 yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.

ROSS:
 well, i don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because i am not emotionally unavailable!

PHOEBE:
 you think he’s emotionally unavailable?

ROSS:
 i think he can be.

PHOEBE:
 well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!

ROSS:
 well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!

PHOEBE:
 yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing new year’s eve 1997.

ROSS:
  i knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! that was three years ago! she apologized and she apologized! what more do you want?!!

PHOEBE:
  we want the last six years back!!

ROSS:
 so do we!! so do we!!  i’m sorry you had to see that. 

TAG:

TAG:

RACHEL:
 oh yeah? another night of birdogging the chickas?

TAG:
 no. we had a really good talk. i don’t think i’m gonna do that bar scene anymore.

RACHEL:
 wow! i did not see that coming.

TAG:
 it’s just not really who i am. y'know, i’ve always been happier when…why am i telling you this? you don’t care about this stuff.

RACHEL:
 oh no, yes i do! i do! i mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying i am happier when uh, y’know?

TAG:
 uh-huh! let me ask you something?

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.

TAG:
 do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?

RACHEL:
 well, i-i’m startin’ too.

TAG:

RACHEL:
 yes! hell yes!

TAG:

RACHEL:

TAG:

RACHEL:

TAG:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 my god!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i’m sorry. is that annoying? and speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s whitney?

ROSS:
 well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!

PHOEBE:
 oh he knows!  for the most part. 

KYLE:
 oh hey! good, you’re both here.

WHITNEY:
 we kinda need to talk.

PHOEBE:
 both of you together?

ROSS:
 wh-what’s up?

WHITNEY:
 well, i went over to kyle’s last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing…

KYLE:
 …we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. so… 

ROSS:
 oh just say it kyle!

KYLE:
 we’re gonna give it another try.

PHOEBE:
 what about her whining and her constant need for attention?!

WHITNEY:
 i’m gonna work on that.

PHOEBE:
 oh right, because you’re so capable of change.

ROSS:
  y’know, he hums when he pees!

WHITNEY:
 i do know.

ROSS:
 it makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

WHITNEY:
 we’re so sorry. 

ROSS:
 that’s all right, we-we don’t need you. in fact, hey i’m over it already.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and y’know what? i don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.

KYLE:
 yeah, we’re gonna go. 

ROSS:
  i’m sorry. ugh, pheebs, you were, you were right about her. y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! yeah, i hurt my back a little.

PHOEBE:
 oh. y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.

ROSS:
 yeah, were better off without them.

PHOEBE:
 and y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!

ROSS:
 divorced men’s club.

PHOEBE:
 potato, potaato. (she’s pronounces potato with the both the short and long as.) ending credits  

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
