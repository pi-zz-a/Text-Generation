Chandler:
 Id like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isnt the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didnt involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if youd gone to Vail, and if you guysd been with your family, if you didnt have syphilis and stuff, we wouldnt be all together, you know? So I guess what Im trying to say is that Im very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

All:

Roger:
 I dont know. Maybe maybe low selfesteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...

Monica:
 Waitwait, go back to that sibling thing.

Roger:
 Well, I dont know. I mean, its conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.

Ross:
 That thats ridiculous! I dont feel guilty for her failures!

Monica:
 Oh! So you think Im a failure!

Phoebe:
 Isnt he good?

Ross:
 Nonono, thatthats not what I was saying...

Ross:

Joey:
 Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, sizewise.

Phoebe:

Joey:
 Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay. 

Phoebe:
 Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.

Chandler:
 And thats the Chrysler Building right there. 

Mr. Douglas:
 Nina. 

Nina:
 Mr.Douglas... flirting defensively ..cool tie. She escapes, fortunately so distracting Mr. Douglas, that he misses Chandlers expression of alarm  guilt. 

Mr. Douglas:
 Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Ninas shapely departure Shes still here. 

Chandler:
 Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanennen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.  Thinking quickly, Chandler desperately tries to remember anything to do with schizophrenia....  

Chandler:
 And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy. 

Mr. Douglas:
 Youre kidding? She seems so... 

Chandler:
 Oh, no, no. Nina... miming fairies twinkling around his head ..she is whooo weweewoo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. 

Mr. Douglas:
 Thats unbelievable. 

Chandler:
 And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. 

Mr. Douglas:
 I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head. 

Chandler:
 Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir. Mr. Douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what Bing has just said, but turning to follow Nina down the corridor, he realises Bing must be telling the truth, since he would not have any personal interest in the girl, would he?

Teacher:
 Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class. People start getting up. Ross grabs Carols doll to hold it upside down like a football, slapping it with his other hand. 

Ross:
 Susan, go deep. Susan just glares back, as Rosss inappropriate joke falls flat. Meanwhile, a bubble is about to burst... 

Carol:
 This is impossible. Its just impossible. 

Susan:
 What is, honey? 

Carol:

 screaming at Ross Oh, what do you know?  No ones going up to you and saying, Hi, is that your nostril?  Mind if we push this pot roast through it? 

Susan:
 Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath. Both women gulp in air. Ross looks at his football, then manipulates the head  limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents. 

Susan:
 I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives. Ross is staring blankly into space. 

Susan:
 I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?

 I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. 

Chandler:
 Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us. 

Nina:
 Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors. 

Chandler:
 Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise. 

Nina:

 Sure, why not? 

Nina:
 Oh my god! Rushing over to give him a big hug Youre amazing!

Little tip:

Monica:
 Okay, I think I get how to do this. Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book, but the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.

When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? 

Monica and Rachel:
 Wistfully, shaking their heads No. 

Phoebe:
 Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us. 

Rachel:
 Oh... Oh, Pheebs. 

Phoebe:
 I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but... 

Chandler:
 Youre not gonna lose him. 

Monica:
 Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.

Phoebe:
 Okay... Okay. Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now. 

Phoebe:
 Oh, okay, oh. Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joeys apartment is shut. She knocks, and anxiously waits for Joey to come, but instead her identical twin sister emerges wearing one of Joeys shirts. 

Ursula:
 Surprised Oh. Phoebe reels back in shock, while Ursula defiantly leans against the doorpost as though she owns the place. 

Ursula:

Rachel:

Chandler:
 Alright, what have we learned so far? There is a knock at the door. Someone turns the music off, then the whole party runs and hides, except for Monica and Rachel who answer their door. Ross stands in the doorway, holding a box, but everyone is too keyed up to notice that its him.

The Whole Party:
 Jumping up SURPRISE!!! Ross is so startled that he throws his arms up to defend himself. The box takes off, then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. Ross is not pleased.

Mr. Geller:
 Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And thats when I knew.

They dont know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room STAT! Rachel joins Monica who is in the kitchen area, opening the wine bottle. Rachel checks that the doctors arent listening, then lowers her voice anyway.

Rachel:
 Okay, listen, Im thinking, why dont we just tell them who we really are? I mean, itll be fine, I really think itll be fine.

Monica:
 It will not be fine. Well get in trouble.

Rachel:
 Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?

Monica:
 A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay? Back at the couch, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Rosen have concerns of their own.

Dr. Mitchell:
 So?

Dr. Rosen:
 So... they sssstill seem normal.

Dr. Mitchell:
 Thats because they are.

Dr. Rosen:
 Nervously okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...

Dr. Mitchell:
 Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, theyre fine. Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger Go like this. Dr. Rosen obeys. Meanwhile, back at the sink.

Monica:
 I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.

Rachel:
 Resenting the truth I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...

Rachel:
 Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother. Rachel brightly limps back across the apartment with glasses of wine for the cute doctors, leaving an openmouthed Monica in her wake.

Rachel:
 Hello! Here we go!

Dr. Rosen:
 This is a great place. How long have you lived here?

Rachel:
 as Monica Thanks! Ive been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.

Monica:
 as Rachel Yeah... joining the others ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Rachel tries to hide her alarm, but she squirms in her chair.

Dr. Mitchell:
 Really?

Monica:
 as Rachel Yeah... Yeah, I know its pretty selfish, but haha, hey, thats me. Indicating a dish on the table Why dont you try the hummus?

Dr. Rosen:
 So, Monica, what do you do?

Rachel:
 as Monica Aahh, Im a... chef at a restaurant uptown.

Dr. Rosen:

Rachel:
 as Monica Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.

Dr. Rosen:
 This hummus is great.

Dr. Mitchell:
 God bless the chickpea.

Monica:
 as Rachel Suddenly laughing Oh, god, I am so spoiled... Thats it! The doctors dont know what to make of all this.

Rachel:
 as Monica And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?

Monica:
 as Rachel I used to wet my bed.

Rachel:
 as Monica I use my breasts to get other peoples attention.

Monica:
 as Rachel Revealing her anger to point at her best friend We both do that! Rachel lets her anger show too. Hideously embarrassed, the doctors drain their glasses in the vicious pause which follows. The telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. Finally both guys jump up, and Michael wins.

Dr. Mitchell:
 on the phone Monica and Rachels apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... handing it to Monica ..ah, Rachel, its your dad.

Monica:
 as Rachel Hi, Dad. No, no, its me. Getting up to move further away from Rachel lilisten, Dad, I cant talk right now, um, but theres something, um... theres something that Ive been meaning to tell you... Monica glares triumphantly across the room, scaring Rachel who also stands up.

Rachel:
 Would you excuse me for a second?

Monica:
 as Rachel Remember back in freshman year? Talking fast before Rachel can catch her Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed. Completely undone by Monicas verbal destruction, Rachel almost loses her balance as she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. Finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned Dr. Mitchell looks philosophically at Dr. Rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan altar.

Scene:
 Monica and Rachels, the next morning, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Monica sit round the coffee table, playing Scrabble. Rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading on the phone, her free hand shaking with agitation.

Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green cant hear, while mouthing You are... ...dead! Monica smiles a sweet apology of regret, until shes distracted by Marcel as he clambers all over her nice furniture.

Monica:
 Ross, hes got the remote again.

Ross:
 Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Marcel changes channel to Bugs Bunny, who is speaking in Spanish.

Ross:
 Maybe not. Meanwhile, Rachel has taken another call, from a nurse shed hoped never to hear from again.

Rachel:
 Hello? Listens Um, yeah, uh, snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if shes here.

Ross:
 Well did you try calling her?

Joey:
 Ive been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I cant believe shes blowin me off. Phoebe wants to be angry with Joey, but as she watches him shaking his head in pain and disbelief, she knows that it isnt his fault.

Phoebe:
 Hey. Ursula turns in surprise.

Ursula:
 Oh!

Phoebe:
 Um you, you got a minute?

Ursula:
 Um, yeah, Im just... waving dismissively at the concept ..working. Ursula points out a vacant table, so the twins walk over, side by side, to sit down. Departing customers walk right past the pair. Sitting at the back, a hungry gentleman looks most annoyed as Ursula sets his meal down in front of her. The girls sit.

Phoebe:
 So.

Ursula:
 Uhhuh. Ursula is genuinely pleased that her sister has visited her, after so many years. Phoebe hesitates over how best to begin.

Phoebe:
 Um, oh, I got you a birthday present. Ursula picks up a fork and begins eating the meat, while Phoebe removes a present from her bag.

Ursula:
 Oh, wow! You remembered! Opening it Oh! Its a Judy Jetson thermos! She laughs at the childhood memory. Phoebe smiles at being able to make her point.

Phoebe:
 Right, like the kind you...

Ursula:
 Right... Oh, I got something for you, too. Ursula gets up to fetch a box from her bag by the counter.

Phoebe:
 Howd you know I was coming?

Ursula:
 Um, yeah, um, twin thing. Ursula puts the box directly into Phoebes hand. Phoebe brightens.

Phoebe:
 I cant believe you did this. Phoebe opens the box, to find something familiar inside.

Phoebe:
 I cant believe you... holding up Joeys cardigan ..did this. Phoebes smile hardens as she packs the cardigan away.

Phoebe:
 So... Whats the deal with umm, you and Joey?

Ursula:
 Oh, right. He is so great. But thats over. Ursula resumes eating her lunch..

Phoebe:
 Does he know?

Ursula:
 Who?

Phoebe:
 Joey. You know, um, hes really nutsy about you.

Ursula:
 He is? Why?

Phoebe:
 You got me.

Ursula:
 Right. A waiter comes over for the stolen chicken. Ursula turns to him.

Ursula:
 Excuse me. Doesnt this come with a side salad? The man gives up, shaking his head.

Phoebe:
 So, um, are you gonna call him?

Ursula:
 What? Indicating the departing waiter Do you think he likes me?

Phoebe:
 No, Joey.

Ursula:
 Oh. No, no, he is so smart. Hell figure it out. Offering to share her food Do you want some chicken?

Phoebe:
 No. No food with a face.

Ursula:
 You have not changed! Ursulas eyes dance as she laughs and smiles, simply glad to be back with her sister.

Phoebe:
 Yeah, you too. Trying not to wrinkle her nose, Phoebe smiles back realising its down to her to make up for her negligent sister. Meanwhile, Ursula still hasnt received her side salad, but when she attempts to attract the waiters attention, he ignores her.

Scene:

Chandler:
 Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.

Ross:
 Uhhuh.

Chandler:
 Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.

Ross:
 Do you have a point?

Chandler:
 You know, you think I would. Instead of scampering, Marcel stretches his neck as much as possible, and makes an unvoiced noise from his throat.

Chandler:
 Whats up with the simian?

Ross:
 Its just a fur ball.

Chandler:
 Okay... returning to the board ..whose turn is it?

Ross:

Nurse:
 angrily You go get that animal outta here.

Ross:
 No, no you dont understand the animal hospital is way across town hes choking I dont know what else to do.

Monica:
 Whats goin on? Ross and Chandler turn at the voice...

Chandler:
 Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

Rachel:
 Oh. ..then turn back to the desk when the surprise hits them, and Ross and Chandler whip around once more. Monica and Rachel recoil slightly.

Nurse:
 Excuse me... This hospital is for people!

Ross:
 Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobodys watching. Please, please have a heart! Rosss vigorous protest is attracting attention.

Dr. Mitchell:

Rachel and Monica:
 Oh, thank you.

Monica:
 Michael.

Dr. Mitchell:

Scene:
 Central Perk, Joey is playing She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not with the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. Phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and makeup to match that of her twin sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa.

Phoebe:
 as Ursula Hey.

Joey:
 Urse... Phoebe nods as he stands up in delight.

Joey:
 ..ah, whatre you doing here? Ive been trying to call you.

Phoebe:

Joey:

Phoebe:

Joey:
 You dont drink.

Phoebe:
 as Ursula Thats right, I dont... But I was, I was drunk on you!

Joey:
 Oh, Urse... He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.

Phoebe:
 as Ursula Okay, yeah, so its not gonna work.

Joey:
 Why? Is it because Im friends with Phoebe?

Phoebe:
 as Ursula If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?

Joey:
 Thinking carefully no. No, I, I couldnt do that.

Phoebe:
 as Ursula Um, then yes, its cause of Phoebe! So, you know, its either her or me.

Joey:
 Then, uh, then Im sorry. He sinks to the sofa, saddened by Ursulas ultimatum, while Phoebe follows, touched by Joeys good heart.

Phoebe:
 as Ursula You know... unconsciously putting a hand on his knee Youre gonna be really, really hard to get over.

Joey:
 I know... He looks up at her face and Phoebe, slipping out of character, smiles back at him. Joeys voice becomes soft and warm.

Joey:
 I dont know whether its just cause were breakin up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.

Phoebe:
 Really? Phoebe smiles, when Joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. Phoebe silently shouts Oh, whoa!! to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. A thoughtful Joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various angles, then...

Joey:
 Pheebs?

Phoebe:
 Automatically Yeah. Oooh... shes sprung.

Scene:
 The Hospital, Marcel lies on the operating table while recovering from the anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. Ross sits beside him, as a smiling Chandler, Monica and Rachel look on.

Joey:
 We just got the message.

Phoebe:
 Is he alright?

Ross:
 Yeah. The doctor got the K out. He also found an M and an O.

Chandler:
 We think he was trying to spell out MONKEY. Ross does not approve of Chandlers daft theory.

Ross:
 Well, the doctor says hes gonna be fine, hes just sleeping now.

Chandler:
 Tapping Ross on his shoulder So, you feel like a dad yet?

Ross:
 No, why?

Chandler:
 Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad. Ross does approve of this, but hes still not sure. The tiny figure stirs.

Monica:
 Oh, look, hes waking up!

Ross:
 Quietly hey, fella! How you doing? All of a sudden, Marcel grabs Rosss finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that Ross finally knows what it is to be a father. He looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, Rachel tenderly resting her chin upon Monicas shoulder. Ross realises that Chandler was right and hes gonna make a great dad! Closing Credits

Chandler:
 Hey, yknow what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890s, when that phrase was last used.

Scene:

There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, cmon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasnt Dexter, right Marcel? Because Looks down and notices he is missing Marcel? Marc Notices the open door Time lapse. Now everyone but Ross and Phoebe is back at Monica and Rachels.

Monica:

Mr. Heckles:

Monica:
 Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?

Mr. Heckles:

Monica:

Mr. Heckles:

Monica:

Mr. Heckles:

Phoebe:

Mr. Heckles:

Ross:

Rachel:

Ross:

Rachel:

Scene:
 Monica and Rachels, continued from earlier.

Ross:
 Angry I I I ca I cant believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.

Rachel:
 I know, I know, Im sorry

Ross:
 No, yknow what, I guess its partially my fault. Yknow, I shouldntve, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I shouldve started you off with like a pen or a pencil.

Rachel:
 Tearfully Ross, Im doing everything that I can, Ive got everybody looking for him, and I Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it Oh! Who is it?

Intercom:
 Animal Control.

Rachel:
 See? Ive even called Animal Control!

Ross:
 You called Animal Control?

Rachel:
 Uhhuh... why... do you not like them?

Ross:
 Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. Im not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, theyll take him away from me.

Rachel:
 Ookay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...

Ross:
 Thats right, I.. cause I didnt expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment! A knock on the door. Rachel swiftly opens it

Rachel:
 Hi, thanks for coming.

Luisa:
 Animal Control Somebody called about a monkey?

Rachel:
 Oh, yknow what? That was a complete misunderstanding! Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light

Ross:
 Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but wewe didnt.

Rachel:
 Turned out it was a hat.

Ross:
 Cat!

Rachel:
 Cat! Whatm I saying? Cat! Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in

Monica:
 Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, noones seen Marcel.

Luisa:
 Marcel?

Ross:
 My uncle Marcel.

Phoebe:
 Oh, is that who the monkeys named after?

Luisa:
 Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?

Phoebe:
 Oh my God. Youd put that poor little creature in jail?

Monica:
 Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?

Phoebe:
 Yes, but there isnt always time!

Monica:
 Look. Im sure theres some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we havent been introduced, Im Monica Geller.

Rachel:

Luisa:
 You have no idea who I am, do you.

Monica:

Monica:

Luisa:
 Ah, its not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. To Rachel But you? What a bitch!

Rachel:

Luisa:
 I could... but I wont. If I find that monkey, hes mine. Leaves

Phoebe:
 Dundunduuuur! Sorry. Cut to another part of the building. We see Marcel jump in through a window and run down some stairs, then Chandler and Joey come down from the upper floor without noticing.

Chandler:
 Marcel?

Joey:
 Marcel?

Chandler:
 Marcel?

Joey:
 Marcel? They come to a door and silently agree to try it. A very sweaty woman emerges

Woman No. 1:
 Hi, can I help you? Chandler and Joey are dumbstruck for a moment

Chandler:
 Um, were kind of having an emergency and wewe were looking for something...

Joey:
 A monkey.

Chandler:
 Yes have you seen any?

Woman No. 1:

Joey:
 Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?

Woman No. 1:
 Of course.

Joey:
 Oh. Then, no. Another sweaty woman comes to the door and speaks to her friend

Woman No. 2:
 Did I put too much rum in here? Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances

Woman No. 1:
 Just a sec. To Chandler and Joey Hope you find your monkey. She starts to shut the door

Chandler:
 Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.

Joey:
 Uh, arent we kind of in the middle of something here?

Chandler:
 Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And theyre very hot.

Joey:
 We cant, alright? To the women Were sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised wed find this monkey. If you see him, hes about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, youd really be helping us out. The women quickly shut the door

Chandler:
 Okay, from now on, you dont get to talk to other people.

Joey:

Phoebe:

Monica:

Monica:
 Look, Phoebe!

Phoebe:
 Yeah! Oh, cmere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, cmere! Luisa appears on the stairs

Luisa:
 Step aside, ladies! She loads a gun

Monica:
 Whatre you gonna do?

Luisa:
 Just a small tranquiliser. In slow motion we see Phoebe look at Marcel, then at Luisa. She jumps toward Marcel just as Luisa fires the gun.

Monica:
 Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe Are you okay?

Phoebe:
 Yeah, think so. Oh! She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it Huh. Sways back Whoah.

Monica:
 Oh gosh. Cut to Marcel walking along a hallway. He notices a banana on the floor and picks it up. The hand of an unseen person grabs him and carries him away. Then cut to Ross and Rachel on the street outside.

Ross:

Rachel:

Ross:
 Marc oh, this is ridiculous! Weve been all over the neighbourhood. Hes gone, heshes just gone.

Rachel:
 Ross, you dont know that.

Ross:

Ross:
 Yeah, yeah. Yknow, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I dont miss Marcel any more!

Rachel:
 Yknow, it is not like I did this on purpose.

Ross:
 Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, youre off in Rachelland, doing your Rachelthing, totally oblivious to peoples monkeys, or to peoples feelings...

Rachel:
 Ross.

Ross:

Rachel:
 Ross.

Ross:
 Oh, forget it, okay?

Rachel:

Ross:

Both:
 Hey! Hey, Bananaman!

Scene 4:
 Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles door. Ross is carrying the box of bananas. He bangs on the door

Phoebe:
 Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea. Mr. Heckles opens the door

Ross:
 Hi, did you order some bananas?

Mr. Heckles:
 What about it?

Ross:
 Gimme back my monkey.

Mr. Heckles:

Mr. Heckles:

Ross:
 Alright, I want my monkey.

Luisa:
 No!

Rachel:
 Oh, cmon, Luisa!

Luisa:

Ross:
 To Rachel You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldntve been fat.

Rachel:
 Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. Cmon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!

Luisa:
 Nope.

Rachel:
 Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?

Scene:
 Monica and Rachels. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress off Marcel.

Ross:
 Itll be nice to get this off finally, wont it? Yes it will. Marcel resists Or we can leave it on for now, thats fine.

Rachel:
 Yknow, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.

Ross:
 Listen, Im Im sorry I was so hard on you before, its just I...

Rachel:
 Oh, Ross, cmon. Its my fault, I almost lost your...

Ross:
 Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, yknow? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?

Rachel:

Ross:
 Alright. He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. He sits down and starts to pour the wine Well, so long as were here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um... Barry bursts in

Barry:

Monica:
 This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?

Phoebe:
 Nope.

Monica:
 Thats because Im in front of them.

Chandler:
 Eh. I thought that was an alp.

Monica:
 Well, high school was not my favourite time.

Joey:
 I dunno, I loved high school. Yknow? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.

Chandler:
 Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had wouldve involved a major lifestyle choice.

Monica:
 Gosh, doesnt it seem like a million years ago?

Chandler:
 I cant believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.

Joey:
 No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, hes got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.

Ross:
 I dont know, you dont wanna mess with corn nuts. Theyre craaazy.

Monica:

Monica:
 So have you called her yet?

Chandler:
 Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? The girls make disgusted noises. Its the next day! How needy do I want to seem? To the guys Im right, right?

Joey and Ross:
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.

Monica:
 I cant believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.

Phoebe:
 Oh, God, just do it! Grabbing the phone. Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!

Chandler:
 Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up. I got her machine.

Joey:
 Her answer machine?

Chandler:
 No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.

Phoebe:
 So, uh, why didnt you say anything?

Chandler:
 Oh, nononono. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase Yes indeedyo.

Monica:
 Look look! Its Rachel and Barry. No, dont everybody look at once!

Ross:
 Okay, okay, whats going on?

Phoebe:
 Okay, theyre just talking...

Ross:
 Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?

Phoebe:
 No, no actually, hes smiling.. and... Oh my God, dont do that!!

Ross:
 What? What? What?!

Phoebe:
 That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Rachel enters. Oh!

Chandler:
 bluffing And basically, thats how a bill becomes a law.

All:
 Oh!... Right!

Chandler:
 Hey Rach!

Monica:
 Howd it go?

Rachel:
 Yknow, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where yknow you poke it and all the butter squirts out...

Phoebe:
 Not a good day for birds...

Rachel:
 Then we took a walk down to Bendalls, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...

Ross:
 Thats nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?

Rachel:
 Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, yknow? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!

Ross:
 Thats, thats nice twice!

Monica:
 Rachel, whats going on? I mean isnt this the same Barry who you left at the altar?

Joey:
 Duh, whereve you been?

Rachel:
 Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasnt, like, Orthodontist Guy, yknow? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that? Ross prompts Chandler by hitting him on the arm.

Chandler:
 Yes!

Rachel:
 Why?

Chandler:
 I have my reasons.

Monica:
 Okay, how about the fact that hes engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your exbest friend?

Rachel:
 All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know its stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!

Monica:

Phoebe:
 Oh my God! Walks to the window Go away! Gesturing. Stop looking in here!

Monica:
 Great, now hes waving back.

Joey:
 Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I cant do stuff!

Monica:
 What kinda stuff?

Joey:
 Will you grow up? Im not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when Im cooking naked.

Phoebe:
 You cook naked?

Joey:
 Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. A pause as they look at Chandler.

Chandler:
 What are you looking at me for? I didnt know that.

Scene:
 Barrys Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.

Barry:
 Whats the matter?

Rachel:
 Oh, its just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.

Barry:
 No, it was. It was very very good.

Rachel:
 I had a bra. Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby enters.

Bobby:
 Hey, Dr. Farber. Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachels mouth.

Barry:
 All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think were starting to see some real progress here. Bobby looks on, deadpan.

Rachel:
 What?!

Bobby:
 Im twelve, Im not stupid. Rachel glares at him.

Scene:
 Monica and Rachels, Chandler enters clutching his phone.

Chandler:
 Can I use your phone?

Monica:
 Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone. Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.

Chandler:
 Yes, its working! Why isnt she calling me back?

Joey:
 Maybe she never got your message.

Phoebe:
 Yknow, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didnt get her messages yet.

Chandler:
 Ydont think that makes me seem a little...

Ross:
 ...desperate, needy, pathetic?

Chandler:
 Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad. He calls and quickly hangs up.

Phoebe:
 How many beeps?

Chandler:
 She answered.

Monica:
 Ysee, this is where youd use that hello word we talked about.

Chandler:
 Im not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now Im needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy. Rachel enters.

Ross:
 No, no. The vet says unless hes in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin, hes just gonna get vicious. Ive just gotta get him into a zoo.

Joey:
 How do you get a monkey into a zoo?

Chandler:
 I know that one! ...No, thats Popes into a Volkswagen.

Ross:
 Well, were applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, yknow, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, yknow, hes out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so thats a possibility.

Chandler:
 Yeah, but thats like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, its a total party zoo. Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.

Monica:
 Nononononono. Think who youre dealing with here. I mean, Im not like you. II cant even stand in front of a tap class.

Fake Monica:
 Well, thats just probably cause of your Amish background.

Monica:
 What?

Fake Monica:
 Well, youre Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

Monica:
 Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.

Fake Monica:
 II used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?

Monica:
 Uhhuh.

Fake Monica:
 I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he cant be in the play? What was that?! Its like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, Now, thats two hours of my life that Im never getting back. And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.

Monica:
 Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

Ross:
 Yes.

Dr. Baldhara:
 Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

Ross:
 Nono, hes, hes very docile.

Dr. Baldhara:

Ross:
 Well I, I dont know. Why?

Dr. Baldhara:
 Uh, how is he at handling small objects?

Ross:
 He can hold a banana, if thats whatcha mean...

Dr. Baldhara:
 How about a hammer, or a small blade?

Ross:
 Why why why would he need a blade?

Dr. Baldhara:
 Well, if hes up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, youve got to give the little guy something. Otherwise its just cruel. Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel

Chandler and Joey:
 He he he got in, he he got in to San Diego.

Joey:
 We, we come back from our walk and the the phone was ringing...

Chandler:
