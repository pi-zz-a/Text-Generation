MONICA:
 there's nothing to tell! he's just some guy i work with!

JOEY:
 c'mon, you're going out with the guy! there's gotta be something wrong with him!

CHANDLER:
 all right joey, be nice.  so does he have a hump? a hump and a hairpiece?

PHOEBE:
 wait, does he eat chalk? 

PHOEBE:
 just, 'cause, i don't want her to go through what i went through with carl- oh!

MONICA:
 okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date. it's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.

CHANDLER:
 sounds like a date to me. 

CHANDLER:
 alright, so i'm back in high school, i'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and i realize i am totally naked.

 oh, yeah. had that dream.

CHANDLER:
 then i look down, and i realize there's a phone... there.

JOEY:
 instead of...?

CHANDLER:
 that's right.

JOEY:
 never had that dream.

PHOEBE:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. now i don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. 

MONICA:
 and they weren't looking at you before?!

CHANDLER:
 finally, i figure i'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me! 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 this guy says hello, i wanna kill myself.

MONICA:
 are you okay, sweetie?

ROSS:
 i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...

CHANDLER:
 cookie?

MONICA:
  stuff out today. 

JOEY:
 ohh.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 thanks.

PHOEBE:
 ooh! oh!  

ROSS:
 no, no don't! stop cleansing my aura! no, just leave my aura alone, okay?

PHOEBE:
 fine!  be murky!

ROSS:
 i'll be fine, alright? really, everyone. i hope she'll be very happy.

MONICA:
 no you don't.

ROSS:
 no i don't, to hell with her, she left me!

JOEY:
 and you never knew she was a lesbian...

ROSS:
 no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? she didn't know, how should i know?

CHANDLER:
 sometimes i wish i was a lesbian...   did i say that out loud?

ROSS:
 i told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.

MONICA:
 oh really, so that

00 a.m., "i'll never have grandchildren, i'll never have grandchildren." was what?  a wrong number?

ROSS:
 sorry.

JOEY:
 alright ross, look. you're feeling a lot of pain right now. you're angry. you're hurting. can i tell you what the answer is? 

JOEY:
 strip joint! c'mon, you're single! have some hormones!

ROSS:
 i don't want to be single, okay? i just... i just- i just wanna be married again!  

CHANDLER:
 and i just want a million dollars!  

MONICA:
 rachel?!

RACHEL:
 oh god monica hi! thank god! i just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!

 can i get you some coffee?

MONICA:
  everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor.  this is chandler, and phoebe, and joey, and- you remember my brother ross? 

RACHEL:
 hi, sure!

ROSS:
 hi.   back down defeated again.  a moment of silence follows as rachel sits and the others 

MONICA:
 so you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

RACHEL:
 oh god... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and i was looking at this gravy boat. this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat. when all of a sudden-  on by this gravy boat than by barry! and then i got really freaked out, and that's when it

 how much barry looks like mr. potato head. y'know, i mean, i always knew looked familiar, but... anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering 'why am i doing this, and who am i doing this for?'.  to go, and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person i knew who lived here in the city.

MONICA:
 who wasn't invited to the wedding.

RACHEL:
 ooh, i was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...  

MONICA:
 now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. 

CHANDLER:
  tuna or egg salad?  decide!

ROSS:
  whatever christine is having.

RACHEL:
  him! i'm sorry. i just don't love him. well, it matters to me!   

PHOEBE:
  if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off. 

CHANDLER:
  those pants. 

JOEY:
 i say push her down the stairs. 

  push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs! 

RACHEL:
 c'mon daddy, listen to me! it's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i'm not saying i want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy!

ROSS:
 you can see where he'd have trouble.

RACHEL:
 look daddy, it's my life. well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. 

MONICA:
 well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica...

RACHEL:
 well, maybe that's my decision. well, maybe i don't need your money. wait!! wait, i said maybe!! 

MONICA:
 just breathe, breathe.. that's it. just try to think of nice calm things...

PHOEBE:
  kittens,  with mittens... la la la la...something and noodles with string.  these are a few...

RACHEL:
 i'm all better now.

PHOEBE:
   i helped!

MONICA:
 okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? independence. taking control of your life.  the whole, 'hat' thing.

JOEY:
  you can always come to joey. me and chandler live across the hall. and he's away a lot.

MONICA:
 joey, stop hitting on her! it's her wedding day!

JOEY:
 what, like there's a rule or something? 

CHANDLER:
 please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.

  it's paul.

MONICA:
 oh god, is it

30?  buzz him in!

JOEY:
 who's paul?

ROSS:
 paul the wine guy, paul?

MONICA:
 maybe. joey: wait. your 'not a real date' tonight is with paul the wine guy?

ROSS:
 he finally asked you out?

MONICA:
 yes!

CHANDLER:
 ooh, this is a dear diary moment.

MONICA:
 rach, wait, i can cancel...

RACHEL:
 please, no, go, that'd be fine!

MONICA:
  want me to stay?

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
  guy!

PHOEBE:
 what does that mean?   does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?  

MONICA:
 hi, come in! paul, this is..  ... everybody, everybody, this is paul.

 hey! paul! hi! the wine guy! hey!

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry, i didn't catch your name. paul, was it?

MONICA:
 okay, umm-umm, i'll just--i'll be right back, i just gotta go ah, go ah...

ROSS:
 a wandering?

MONICA:
 change!  okay, sit down. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes. that can't be good. 

JOEY:
  hey, paul!

 yeah?

JOEY:
 here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.

MONICA:
  shut up, joey!

ROSS:
 so rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?

RACHEL:
 well, i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!

ROSS:
 right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  lizards... anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.

CHANDLER:
  about it. 

RACHEL:
 well actually thanks, but i think i'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  it's been kinda a long day.

ROSS:
 okay, sure.

JOEY:
 hey pheebs, you wanna help?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to. commercial break  

PHOEBE:
  summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  la-la-la-la-la-   thank you.   

ROSS:
  supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and- i cannot feel my legs.  

JOEY:
 i'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.

CHANDLER:
 it's a beautiful thing.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 i would have to say that is an 'l'-shaped bracket.

JOEY:
 which goes where?

CHANDLER:
 i have no idea.  

JOEY:
 done with the bookcase!

CHANDLER:
 all finished!

ROSS:
  carol's favorite beer. she always drank it out of the can, i should have known.

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.

CHANDLER:
 yes, please don't spoil all this fun.

JOEY:
 ross, let me ask you a question. she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv- what did you get?

ROSS:
 you guys.

CHANDLER:
 oh, god.

JOEY:
 you got screwed.

CHANDLER:
 oh my god! 

MONICA:
 oh my god!

 i know, i know, i'm such an idiot. i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. i mean, how clean can teeth get?

MONICA:
 my brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. how did you get through it?

 well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-

MONICA:
 -leg?

  the watch.

MONICA:
 you actually broke her watch?  wow!  the worst thing i ever did was, i-i shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.

 ooh, steer clear of you.

MONICA:
 that's right. 

RACHEL:
 barry, i'm sorry... i am so sorry... i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and i ju-   hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs. barry finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  and not that i have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...   

ROSS:
 i'm divorced!  i'm only 26 and i'm divorced!

JOEY:
 shut up!

CHANDLER:
 you must stop!  

ROSS:
 that only took me an hour.

CHANDLER:
 look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento.   you, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  i don't think that was my point!

ROSS:
 you know what the scariest part is? what if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? i mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...

JOEY:
 what are you talking about? 'one woman'? that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. lemme tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there. there's rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing! cherry vanilla. you could get 'em with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! this is the best thing that ever happened to you! you got married, you were, like, what, eight? welcome back to the world! grab a spoon!

ROSS:
 i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny.

CHANDLER:
 stay out of my freezer!  

 ever since she walked out on me, i, uh...

MONICA:
 what?..... what, you wanna spell it out with noodles?

 no, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.

MONICA:
 oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?

 isn't there?

MONICA:
 yeah... yeah, i think there is. -what were you gonna say?

 well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, i haven't been able to, uh, perform. 

MONICA:
  god, i am sorry... i am so sorry...

 it's okay...

MONICA:
 i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. um... how long?

 two years.

MONICA:
 wow! i'm-i'm-i'm glad you smashed her watch! 

 so you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?

MONICA:
   

 we are gathered here today to join joanne louise cunningham and charles, chachi-chachi-chachi, arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.

RACHEL:
 oh...see... but joanne loved chachi! that's the difference!  

ROSS:
  it's been since i've grabbed a spoon? do the words 'billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? 

JOEY:
 great story!  but, i uh, i gotta go, i got a date with andrea--angela--andrea...  oh man, 

CHANDLER:
 angela's the screamer, andrea has cats.

JOEY:
 right.  thanks.  it's june.  i'm outta here. 

ROSS:
 y'know, here's the thing. even if i could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am i gonna ask?    commercial break  

RACHEL:
 isn't this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life.

CHANDLER:
 that is amazing.

JOEY:
 congratulations. 

RACHEL:
 y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there isn't anything i can't do.

CHANDLER:
 if can invade poland, there isn't anything i can't do.

JOEY:
 listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a western omelet or something...   although actually i'm really not that hungry...

MONICA:
  good, lenny and squigy are here.

 morning. good morning.

  morning.

JOEY:
 morning, paul.

RACHEL:
 hello, paul.

CHANDLER:
 hi, paul, is it?  so the others can't hear.  the others move monica's table closer to the door so that 

 thank you!  thank you so much!

MONICA:
 stop!

 no, i'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in witness.

MONICA:
 we'll talk later.

 yeah. 

JOEY:
 that wasn't a real date?! what the hell do you do on a real date?

MONICA:
 shut up, and put my table back.

 okayyy! 

CHANDLER:
 all right, kids, i gotta get to work. if i don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... 

RACHEL:
 so, like, you guys all have jobs?

MONICA:
 yeah, we all have jobs. see, that's how we buy stuff.

JOEY:
 yeah, i'm an actor.

RACHEL:
 wow! would i have seen you in anything?

JOEY:
 i doubt it. mostly regional work.

MONICA:
 oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the reruns' production of pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.

JOEY:
 look, it was a job all right?

CHANDLER:
 'look, gippetto, i'm a real live boy.'

JOEY:
 i will not take this abuse.  

CHANDLER:
 you're right, i'm sorry.   "once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."

JOEY:
 you should both know, that he's a dead man.  oh, chandler? 

MONICA:
 so how you doing today? did you sleep okay? talk to barry? i can't stop smiling.

RACHEL:
 i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

MONICA:
 i know, he's just so, so... do you remember you and tony demarco?

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah.

MONICA:
 well, it's like that. with feelings.

RACHEL:
 oh wow. are you in trouble.

MONICA:
 big time!

RACHEL:
 want a wedding dress?   hardly used.

MONICA:
 i think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. okay. okay. i am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. or else i'm just gonna get up and go to work.

RACHEL:
 oh, look, wish me luck!

MONICA:
 what for?

RACHEL:
 i'm gonna go get one of those  things.  

 hey, monica! 

MONICA:
 hey frannie, welcome back! how was florida? 

 you had sex, didn't you? 

MONICA:
 how do you do that?

 oh, i hate you, i'm pushing my aunt roz through parrot jungle and you're having sex!  so? who? 

MONICA:
 you know paul? 

 paul the wine guy? oh yeah, i know paul. 

MONICA:
 you mean you know paul like i know paul? 

 are you kidding? i take credit for paul. y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.  

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 why?! why? why, why would anybody do something like that? 

ROSS:
 i assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. 

MONICA:
 i hate men!  i hate men!

PHOEBE:
 oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.

MONICA:
 is it me? is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 

PHOEBE:
 all right, c'mere, gimme your feet. 

MONICA:
 i just thought he was nice, y'know? 

JOEY:
   

RACHEL:
 guess what? 

ROSS:
 you got a job? 

RACHEL:
 are you kidding? i'm trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today. 

CHANDLER:
 and yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 

RACHEL:
 you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, how well you know me... 

RACHEL:
 they're my new 'i don't need a job, i don't need my parents, i've got great boots' boots! 

MONICA:
 how'd you pay for them? 

RACHEL:
 uh, credit card. 

MONICA:
 and who pays for that? 

RACHEL:
 um... my... father.   

RACHEL:
 oh god, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  i mean, i can stop charging anytime i want. 

MONICA:
 c'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. 

RACHEL:
 i know that. that's why i was getting married. 

PHOEBE:
 give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. 

RACHEL:
 thank you. 

PHOEBE:
 you're welcome. i remember when i first came to this city. i was fourteen. my mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i didn't know anybody. and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel.  

ROSS:
 the word you're looking for is 'anyway'... 

MONICA:
 all right, you ready?

RACHEL:
 no.  no, no, i'm not ready!  how can i be ready?  "hey, rach!  you ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  come on, i can't do this!

MONICA:
 you can, i know you can! 

RACHEL:
 i don't think so.

ROSS:
 come on, you made coffee!   you can do anything!  

ROSS:
 c'mon, cut. cut, cut, cut,... 

 cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... 

RACHEL:
 y'know what?  i think we can just leave it at that.  it's kinda like a symbolic gesture...

MONICA:
  rachel!  that was a library card! 

 cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..

CHANDLER:
   y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.   

MONICA:
 welcome to the real world! it sucks. you're gonna love it!    

MONICA:
 well, that's it 

ROSS:
 no. no, i gotta go home sometime. 

MONICA:
 you be okay? 

ROSS:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 hey mon, look what i just found on the floor. 

MONICA:
 that's paul's watch. you just put it back where you found it. oh boy. alright. goodnight, everybody. 

 goodnight. 

ROSS:
 mmm. 

RACHEL:
 sorry- 

ROSS:
 no no no, go- 

RACHEL:
 no, you have it, really, i don't want it- 

ROSS:
 split it? 

RACHEL:
 okay. 

ROSS:
 okay.  high school, i had a, um, major crush on you. 

RACHEL:
 i knew. 

ROSS:
 you did! oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother. 

RACHEL:
 i did. 

ROSS:
 oh. listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out? sometime? maybe? 

RACHEL:
 yeah, maybe... 

ROSS:
 okay... okay, maybe i will... 

RACHEL:
 goodnight. 

ROSS:
 goodnight.  

MONICA:
 see ya.... waitwait, what's with you? 

ROSS:
 i just grabbed a spoon.    closing credits 

JOEY:
 i can't believe what i'm hearing here. 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 what? i-i said you had a- 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh, was i doing it again?

 yes!

MONICA:
 i said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.

JOEY:
 oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.

ROSS:
 there's an image. 

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 did you make it, or are you just serving it? 

RACHEL:
 i'm just serving it. 

 yeah. yeah, i'll have a cup of coffee. 

CHANDLER:
 kids, new dream... i'm in las vegas.  

   ahh, miss?   more coffee? 

RACHEL:
 ugh.  this to that guy over there?  you. 

MONICA:
 what you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 

JOEY:
 yeah, right!.......y'serious? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah! 

RACHEL:
 everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 

MONICA:
 absolutely. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out. 

ROSS:
 yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 

CHANDLER:
 the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, well, word of advice: bring back the comedian. otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. 

JOEY:
  opening credits  

ROSS:
 no, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 

 well, she has issues. 

ROSS:
 does she. 

 he's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 

ROSS:
 marsha, these are cave people. okay? they have issues like 'gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' see? 

 speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?  

ROSS:
 

 yes, it is. carol! hi! 

ROSS:
 okay, okay, yes, it is.  the ice age.  

ROSS:
hi. 

 so. 

ROSS:
 you look great. i, uh... i hate that. 

 sorry. you look good too. 

ROSS:
 ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... so what's new? still, uh... 

 a lesbian? 

ROSS:
 well... you never know. how's, um.. how's the family? 

 marty's still totally paranoid. oh, and, uh- 

ROSS:
 why- why are you here, carol? 

 i'm pregnant. 

ROSS:
 pregnant?!   

CHANDLER:
 oh, i think this is the episode of three's company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 

PHOEBE:
...then i've already seen this one! 

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 

MONICA:
 whose little ball of paper is this?! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i didn't need it, so i balled it up and...  ...now i wish i was dead.  

PHOEBE:
 she's already fluffed that pillow... monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- 

MONICA:
 look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 

PHOEBE:
 monica- hi! um, monica, you're scaring me. i mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. and not-not in a good way. 

JOEY:
 yeah, calm down. you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 

MONICA:
 that's because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. y'see, he's the prince. apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born. 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 what? 

CHANDLER:
 ugly naked guy got a thighmaster! 

 eeaagh!  

RACHEL:
 has anybody seen my engagement ring? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, it's beautiful. 

RACHEL:
 oh god, oh god, oh god oh god oh god oh god....   

PHOEBE:
 no, look, don't touch that! 

RACHEL:
 oh, like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'hi barry! remember me? i'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' oh god and now i'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 

MONICA:
 easy rach, we'll find it. 

 oh! yeah!

JOEY:
 alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

PHOEBE:
 doy! probably right before she lost it! 

CHANDLER:
 you don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 

RACHEL:
 i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with... 

CHANDLER:
 ...dinah? 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 you didn't. 

RACHEL:
 oh, i am sorry... 

MONICA:
 i gave you one job!   

RACHEL:
 oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 

CHANDLER:
 now, monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 boys? we're going in.    

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 wow. that is not a happy hi. 

ROSS:
 carol's pregnant. 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 w-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 

ROSS:
 yeah. do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now. 

CHANDLER:
 kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon? 

RACHEL:
 well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 

ROSS:
 well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved, but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 

PHOEBE:
 she is so great! i miss her. 

MONICA:
 what does she mean by 'involved'? 

CHANDLER:
 i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 

ROSS:
 anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 

RACHEL:
 so what are you gonna do? 

ROSS:
 i have no idea. no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father.  

JOEY:
 .....well, this is still ruined, right?   

 oh, martha ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  mmm! what's that curry taste? 

MONICA:
 curry. 

 mmmm! 

ROSS:
 i- i think they're great! i, i really do. 

  you, didn't she? 

 they all had a thing for him. 

ROSS:
 aw, mom... 

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 

 oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... i don't know. anyway, i told her you had a restaurant- 

MONICA:
 no mom, i don't have a restaurant, i work in a restaurant. 

 well, they don't have to know that...   

MONICA:
 ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 

ROSS:
 yeah. 

 oh, we're having spaghetti! that's.... easy. 

MONICA:
 i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? because i think it might take some of the heat off me.  

 what that rachel did to her life.... we ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. 

 i'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! 

 well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 

MONICA:
 what's that supposed to mean? 

 nothing! it's an expression. 

MONICA:
 no it's not. 

 don't listen to your mother. you're independent, and you always have been! even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! and you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...  

 look, there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. other people are satisfied with staying where they are- i'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.  

 ...and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god 'our little harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 

MONICA:
  with you? any stories?  share with the folks? 

ROSS:
  you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. carol's a lesbian. she's living with a woman named susan. she's pregnant with my child, and she and susan are going to raise the baby.  

  commercial break 

JOEY:
 your folks are really that bad, huh? 

ROSS:
 well, y'know, these people are pros. they know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 

MONICA:
 boy, i know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- 

ROSS:
 must pee. 

PHOEBE:
 y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. 

RACHEL:
 you're twins? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. we don't speak. she's like this high-powered, driven career type. 

CHANDLER:
 what does she do? 

PHOEBE:
 she's a waitress. 

RACHEL:
 all right, you guys, i kinda gotta clean up now.   

MONICA:
 chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this. 

CHANDLER:
 well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 

RACHEL:
 the lights, please..   

ROSS:
 ...how long was i in there? 

RACHEL:
 i'm just cleaning up. 

ROSS:
 d'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 

RACHEL:
 uh.. okay, sure! thanks! 

ROSS:
 anyway.. um..  tomorrow? 

RACHEL:
 oh.. a little.. 

ROSS:
 mm-hmm.. 

RACHEL:
 a lot. 

ROSS:
 mm. 

RACHEL:
 so, got any advice? y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 

ROSS:
 well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, i know it'll be hard. or, y'know, uh, hey!, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring, and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn... 

RACHEL:
 oh, you've got carol tomorrow.. when did it get so complicated? 

ROSS:
 got me. 

RACHEL:
 remember when we were in high school together? 

ROSS:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 i mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? 

ROSS:
 yes, yes! 

RACHEL:
 oh! man, i never thought i'd be here.. 

ROSS:
 me either...    

ROSS:
  dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.  

 hi. 

 ross, you remember susan. 

ROSS:
 how could i forget? 

 ross. 

ROSS:
  uh, we're just waiting for...? 

 dr. oberman. 

ROSS:
 ..dr. oberman. okay. and is he- 

 she. 

ROSS:
 -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 

 yes, and she's very supportive. 

ROSS:
 okay, that's great.

ROSS:
 

 ross? that opens my cervix.  

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 i dumped him. 

 okay.  

ROSS:
 so, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? y'know, with us? y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 

 give me a 'for instance'. 

ROSS:
 well, uh, uh, i don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 

 marlon- 

ROSS:
 marlon?! 

 -if it's a boy, minnie if it's a girl. 

ROSS:
 ...as in mouse? 

 as in my grandmother. 

ROSS:
 still, you- you say minnie, you hear mouse. um, how about, um.. how about julia? 

 julia.. 

 we agreed on minnie. 

ROSS:
 's'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. things change, roll with the punches. i believe julia's on the table..?    

 sorry about that. so. what have you been up to? 

RACHEL:
 oh, not much. i-i got a job. 

 oh, that's great. 

RACHEL:
 why are- why are you so tanned? 

 oh, i, uh- i went to aruba. 

RACHEL:
 oh no. you went on our honeymoon alone? 

 no. i went with, uh.. now, this may hurt. 

 me?! 

 no! 

RACHEL:
 mindy?! my maid of honour, mindy?! 

 yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. 

RACHEL:
 oh! well, um.. 

 careful! they haven't quite taken yet. 

RACHEL:
 and you've got lenses! but you hate sticking your finger in your eye! 

 not for her. listen, i really wanted to thank you. 

RACHEL:
 okay.. 

 see, about a month ago, i wanted to hurt you. more than i've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. and i'm an orthodontist. 

RACHEL:
 wow. 

 you know, you were right? i mean, i thought we were happy. we weren't happy. but with mindy, now i'm happy. spit. 

RACHEL:
 what? 

 me. 

RACHEL:
 anyway, um,  you. and thank you for giving it to me. 

 well, thank you for giving it back.  

 hello?!  

 oh, please! what's wrong with helen? 

ROSS:
 helen geller? i don't think so. 

 hello? it's not gonna be helen geller. 

ROSS:
 thank you! 

 no, i mean it's not geller. 

ROSS:
 what, it's gonna be helen willick? 

 no, actually, um, we talked about helen willick-bunch. 

ROSS:
 well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 

 it's my baby too. 

ROSS:
 oh, 's'funny, really? um, i don't remember you making any sperm. 

 yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! 

 all right, you two, stop it! 

ROSS:
 no no no, she gets a credit, hey, i'm in there too. 

 ross. you're not actually suggesting helen willick-bunch-geller? 'cause i think that borders on child abuse. 

ROSS:
 of course not, i'm... suggesting geller-willick-bunch. 

 oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? he knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her geller, then he gets his way! 

ROSS:
 my way?! you-you think this is my way? believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? uh, um, this is too hard. i'm not, i can't do- 

 

 yeah. yeah. a little. 

 well, i was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. 

ROSS:
 you- uh- y'know what, i'm gonna go. i don't- i don't think i can be involved in this particular thing right now.   

ROSS:
 oh my god. 

 look at that. 

 i know.  closing credits  

ROSS:
 well? isn't that amazing? 

JOEY:
 what are we supposed to be seeing here? 

CHANDLER:
 i dunno, but.. i think it's about to attack the enterprise. 

PHOEBE:
 you know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 

ROSS:
 then don't do that, alright? 

PHOEBE:
 okay! 

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 wh- are you welling up? 

MONICA:
 no. 

ROSS:
 you are, you're welling up. 

MONICA:
 am not! 

ROSS:
 you're gonna be an aunt. 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 

 hey, pheebs! hi! 

ROSS:
 hey. oh, oh, how'd it go? 

PHOEBE:
 um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!' 

 ohh. ouch. 

RACHEL:
 what? he said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 

MONICA:
 uh, no. loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'. 

RACHEL:
 since when? 

JOEY:
 since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'. 

CHANDLER:
 or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 

PHOEBE:
 or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'. 

RACHEL:
 and everybody knows this? 

JOEY:
 yeah. cushions the blow. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 

ROSS:
 that's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 

MONICA:
 uh, ross. 

ROSS:
 what? wh- hello? the millners' farm in connecticut? the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....oh my god, chi chi!  opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 "so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 

JOEY:
 "warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 

CHANDLER:
 hey, that was really good! 

JOEY:
 thanks! let's keep going. 

CHANDLER:
 okay. "so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?" 

JOEY:
 "i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke." 

CHANDLER:
 "smoke away."   

CHANDLER:
 i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone. 

JOEY:
 what? 

CHANDLER:
 relax your hand!  

CHANDLER:
 not so much! 

JOEY:
 whoah! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

JOEY:
 hey! 

CHANDLER:
 alright, now try taking a puff.  

CHANDLER:
 alright.. okay. no. give it to me. 

JOEY:
 no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette. 

CHANDLER:
 it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here.  

CHANDLER:
 don't think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. when you're holding it, you feel right. you feel complete. 

JOEY:
 y'miss it? 

CHANDLER:
 nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke.  god.  

MONICA:
 no, no, no. they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.  

JOEY:
 that's ridiculous! 

ROSS:
 can i use.. either thumb? 

RACHEL:
   tea. i'm getting pretty good at this! 

 yeah. yeah, excellent. 

RACHEL:
   

JOEY:
 y'okay, phoebe? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah- no- i'm just- it's, i haven't worked- it's my bank. 

MONICA:
 what did they do to you? 

PHOEBE:
 it's nothing, it's just- okay. i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement- 

ROSS:
 easy. 

PHOEBE:
 - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, satan's minions at work again... 

PHOEBE:
 yes, 'cause now i have to go down there, and deal with them. 

JOEY:
 what are you talking about? keep it! 

PHOEBE:
 it's not mine, i didn't earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 

PHOEBE:
 okay. okay, let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what i'd hear, with every step i took? 'not-mine. not-mine. not-mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... 

MONICA:
 we're with you. we got it.  

PHOEBE:
 okay. i'd- just- i'd never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt. 

RACHEL:
 chandler, what are you doing? 

MONICA:
   

 oh! oh, god! 

ROSS:
 what is this?! 

CHANDLER:
 i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years! 

CHANDLER:
 and this- is my reward! 

ROSS:
 hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, so this time i won't quit! 

 ohhh! put it out! 

CHANDLER:
 all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out.   

PHOEBE:
 oh, no! i- i can't drink this now! 

MONICA:
 alright. i'm gonna go change, i've got a date. 

RACHEL:
 this alan again? how's it goin'? 

MONICA:
 's'going pretty good, y'know? it's nice, and, we're having fun. 

JOEY:
 so when do we get to meet the guy? 

MONICA:
 let's see, today's monday... never. 

 oh, come on! come on! 

MONICA:
 no. not after what happened with steve. 

CHANDLER:
 what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry. 

MONICA:
 look, i don't even know how i feel about him yet. just give me a chance to figure that out. 

RACHEL:
 well, then can we meet him? 

MONICA:
 nope. schhorry.  

MONICA:
 i mean, why should i let them meet him? i mean, i bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. i mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. 

 listen. as someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, i'll

 that is not such a terrible thing. i mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. 

MONICA:
 i know. i just wish that once, i'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. 

 well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..  

JOEY:
 let it go, ross. 

ROSS:
 yeah, well, you didn't know chi chi. 

MONICA:
 do you all promise? 

 yeah! we promise! we'll be good! 

MONICA:
   

JOEY:
 you can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!    

ROSS:
 hey, pheebs. 

PHOEBE:
 'dear ms. buffay. thank you for calling attention to our error. we have credited your account with five hundred dollars. we're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  do you believe this?! now i have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 

RACHEL:
 what bank is this?  

MONICA:
 hey. it's him. 

 

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
  all like me.  

MONICA:
 hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan. 

 hi. 

 hi, alan. 

 i've heard schho much about all you guyschh!   

MONICA:
  okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin. who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?  

MONICA:
 c'mon! 

ROSS:
 ...i'll go. let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, i'm sorry, i can't do this, can't do this. we loved him. 

 loved him! yeah! he's great! 

MONICA:
 wait a minute! we're talking about someone that i'm going out with? 

 yeah! 

RACHEL:
 and did you notice...? 

 

JOEY:
 know what was great? the way his smile was kinda crooked. 

PHOEBE:
 yes, yes! like the man in the shoe! 

ROSS:
 ...what shoe? 

PHOEBE:
 from the nursery rhyme. 'there was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile, who lived in a shoe, for a... while...'  

ROSS:
 ...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 

RACHEL:
 what future boyfriends? nono, i th- i think this could be, y'know, it. 

MONICA:
 really! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah. i'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? 

ROSS:
 you know what i like most about him, though? 

 what? 

ROSS:
 the way he makes me feel about myself. 

 yeah...  commercial break    

MONICA:
 hi.. how was the game? 

ROSS:
 well.. 

 we won!! thank you! yes! 

MONICA:
 fantastic! i have one question: how is that possible? 

JOEY:
 alan. 

ROSS:
 he was unbelievable. he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first base-alan, second base-alan, third base-... 

RACHEL:
 i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 

CHANDLER:
 yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 

MONICA:
 can i ask you guys a question? d'you ever think that alan is maybe.. sometimes.. 

ROSS:
 what? 

MONICA:
 ..i dunno, a little too alan? 

RACHEL:
 well, no. that's impossible. you can never be too alan. 

ROSS:
 yeah, it's his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 

CHANDLER:
 i personally could have a gallon of alan.  

PHOEBE:
 hey, lizzie. 

 hey, weird girl. 

PHOEBE:
 i brought you alphabet soup. 

 did you pick out the vowels? 

PHOEBE:
 yes. but i left in the ys. 'cause, y'know, "sometimes y". uh, i also have something else for you. 

 saltines? 

PHOEBE:
 no, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 

 what?  really money in here. 

PHOEBE:
 i know. 

 weird girl, what are you doing? 

PHOEBE:
 no, i want you to have it. i don't want it. 

 no, no, i ha-i have to give you something. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, that's fine, no. 

 would you like my tin-foil hat? 

PHOEBE:
 no. 'cause you need that. no, it's okay, thanks. 

 please, let me do something. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. okay? 

 okay. 

PHOEBE:
 okay.   of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  he types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.   while not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a  

 keep the change. 

PHOEBE:
 no, i'm fine. 

  

PHOEBE:
 huh!  

ROSS:
 a thumb?!  

 eww! 

PHOEBE:
 i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 

CHANDLER:
 well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five? 

PHOEBE:
 does, um, anyone wanna see? 

 nooo!  

 oh, hey, don't do that! cut it out! 

RACHEL:
 it's worse than the thumb! 

CHANDLER:
 hey, this is so unfair! 

MONICA:
 oh, why is it unfair? 

CHANDLER:
 so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?  

JOEY:
 ...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 

RACHEL:
 well, i-i could live without it. 

JOEY:
 well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?  

ROSS:
 oh, now, don't listen to him, pheebs, i think it's endearing. 

JOEY:
 oh,  

ROSS:
 you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 

RACHEL:
 "indeed there isn't"... i should really get back to work. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 

RACHEL:
 ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on.   

MONICA:
 did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 

 no. 

MONICA:
 okay.. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 

 waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? all right, a cow got through! 

MONICA:
 can you believe it? ...y'know what? i just don't feel the thing. i mean, they feel the thing, i don't feel the thing. 

 honey.. you should always feel the thing. listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him! 

MONICA:
 i know.. it's gonna be really hard. 

 well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. 

MONICA:
 no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about.  

JOEY:
 do you have any respect for your body? 

ROSS:
 don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 

CHANDLER:
 hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 

RACHEL:
  speak to you. 

CHANDLER:
 really? he does?  told you about that, huh. well, yeah, i have one now and then. well, yeah, now. well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. well, okay, thanks! 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 if only he were a woman. 

RACHEL:
 yeah.   

CHANDLER:
 ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 

ROSS:
 okay. i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong? 

RACHEL:
 i think he's across the hall. 

MONICA:
 thanks. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that pop-tart?.. pheebs? 

PHOEBE:
 does anyone want the rest of this pop-tart? 

ROSS:
 hey, i might! 

PHOEBE:
 sorry. ..y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 

 you're kidding. oh my god. 

PHOEBE:
 and on my way over here, i stepped in gum. ...what is up with the universe?! 

JOEY:
  on? 

MONICA:
 nothing. i just think it's nice when we're all here together. 

JOEY:
 even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 

RACHEL:
 uh, joey.. 

JOEY:
 oh, god! 

MONICA:
 

 oh! that was lambchop! 

MONICA:
 please, guys, we have to talk. 

PHOEBE:
 wait, wait, i'm getting a deja vu...no, i'm not. 

MONICA:
 alright, we have to talk. 

PHOEBE:
 there it is! 

MONICA:
 okay. it's-it's about alan. there's something that you should know. i mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. i've decided to break up with alan.  

ROSS:
 is there somebody else? 

MONICA:
 no, nononono.. it's just.. things change. people change. 

RACHEL:
 we didn't change.. 

JOEY:
 so that's it? it's over? just like that? 

PHOEBE:
 you know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and i just- i- 

MONICA:
 look, i- i could go on pretending-

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 i got no sleep last night! 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 what's that? 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 ooh! ooh! and i brought operation! but, um, i lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. but we can prep the guy! 

MONICA:
 uh, rach, it's the visa card people. 

RACHEL:
 oh, god, ask them what they want. 

MONICA:
  this is in reference to?  some unusual activity on your account. 

RACHEL:
 but i haven't used my card in weeks! 

MONICA:
 that is the unusual activity. look, they just wanna see if you're okay. 

RACHEL:
 they wanna know if i'm okay. okay.. they wanna know if i'm okay, okay, let's see. well, let's see, the fica guys took all my money, everyone i know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and i'm getting coffee! and it's not even for me! so if that sounds like i'm okay, okay, then you can tell them i'm okay, okay? 

MONICA:
  left the building, can you call back? 

RACHEL:
 alright, c'mon!    

ROSS:
  

CHANDLER:
 what? there was ice there that night with carol? plastic seats? four thousand angry pittsburgh fans? 

ROSS:
 no, actually i was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. but now you mention it, there was ice there that night... it was the first frost... 

JOEY:
 c'mon, sit. just sit down, sit.   

MONICA:
 you should feel great about yourself! you're doing this amazing independence thing! 

RACHEL:
 monica, what is so amazing? i gave up, like, everything. and for what? 

PHOEBE:
 you are just like jack. 

RACHEL:
 ...jack from downstairs? 

PHOEBE:
 no, jack and the beanstalk. 

MONICA:
 ah, the other jack. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, right! see, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. and then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. and he lived in a village, and you live in the village.. 

RACHEL:
 okay, but pheebs, pheebs, jack gave up a cow, i gave up an orthodontist. okay, i-i-i know, i know i didn't love him- 

PHOEBE:
 oh, see, jack did love the cow. 

RACHEL:
 but see, it was a plan. y'know, it was clear. it was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... 

PHOEBE:
 floopy? 

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

MONICA:
 so what, you're not the only one. i mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. you've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, like that's a word. 

RACHEL:
 okay, but monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? 

MONICA:
 ...pheebs? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, well... 'cause.... you just... i don't like this question. 

RACHEL:
 okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? i mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?   

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
  a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 

   it says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. well, i'm not completely satisfied. 

CHANDLER:
 listen, it's kind of an emergency. well, i guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.  

  these out, sit over there. 

ROSS:
  any trouble, okay, but i'm in a lot of pain here, alright? my face is dented. 

 well, you'll have to wait your turn. 

JOEY:
 well, how long do you think it'll be? 

 

ROSS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 phoebe? 

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 i don't even have a 'pl'. 

 hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion? 

RACHEL:
  ordered... we ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. 

 wait, you're not 'g.stephanopoulos?' man, my dad's gonna kill me! 

MONICA:
  did you say 'g.stephanopoulos?' 

 yeah. this one goes across the street, i must have given him yours. oh, bonehead, bonehead! 

MONICA:
 wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? 

 yeah, that sounds about right. 

MONICA:
 was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 

PHOEBE:
 and-and a power tie? 

 no, pretty much just a towel. 

MONICA:
 

 so you guys want me to take this back? 

MONICA:
 are you nuts?! we've got george stephanopoulos' pizza!   

RACHEL:
 uh, pheebs? who's george snuffalopagus? 

PHOEBE:
 big bird's friend. 

MONICA:
 i see pizza! 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i wanna see! lemme see! lemme see!   

RACHEL:
 hello? who are we spying on? 

MONICA:
 white house adviser? clinton's campaign guy? the one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? 

RACHEL:
 oh, him, the little guy? oh, i love him! 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, wait.. wait, i see a woman. 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 oh, no... 

PHOEBE:
 oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  you, bitch!   kitting foreheads.  chandler realises it's getting tense and goes to the receptionist 

CHANDLER:
 excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. i mean, that guy with the toe thing? who's he sleeping with?   oh, c'mon dora, don't be mad... i know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.   y'know, i feel like i've lost her..   ba-!   

MONICA:
 light still out? 

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

MONICA:
 oh. maybe they're- napping. 

RACHEL:
 oh please, they're having sex. 

 shut up! 

RACHEL:
 so, whaddya think george is like? 

MONICA:
 i think he's shy. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah? 

MONICA:
 yeah. i think you have to draw him out. and then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.   

ROSS:
 i remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- could i get some painkillers over here, please? 

JOEY:
 he's right, enough, already. what is the big deal about today? so you slept with her for the first time, so what? you slept with her for seven years after that. 

ROSS:
 look, it's just a little more complicated... 

CHANDLER:
 well, what? what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women? that she left you for another woman that likes women? 

ROSS:
 little louder, okay, i think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... 

CHANDLER:
 then what? 

ROSS:
 my first time with carol was...   

JOEY:
 what? 

ROSS:
 it was my first time. 

JOEY:
 with carol? 

CHANDLER:
 so in your whole life, you've only been with one

JOEY:
 whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! there was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!   

MONICA:
 okay. okay, i got one. do you remember that vegetarian pate that i made that you loved so much? 

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. 

MONICA:
 well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah! 

PHOEBE:
 oh! oh! oh! okay, fine, fine. now i don't feel so bad about sleeping with jason hurley. 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 a couple hours. 

MONICA:
 oh, that's nice! 

RACHEL:
 okay, okay, okay, i got one!   anyway- the valentine tommy rollerson left in your locker was really from me. 

MONICA:
 excuse me?! 

RACHEL:
 hello? like he was really gonna send you one? 

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 i was laughing! you made me laugh!   

PHOEBE:
 there he is! there he is! 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 oh, george, baby, drop the towel! 

 yeah, drop it! drop the towel! please drop the 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 i think it's great. y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic... 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 no, you kidding? the guy's a freak..   

 hey, buddy. 

ROSS:
 hi.   

 

CHANDLER:
 oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs. oh come on, admit it! all things considered, you had fun tonight. 

ROSS:
 fun? where was the fun? tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? where's my puck? 

JOEY:
 oh, ah- the kid has it. 

ROSS:
 the kid...?  that's, that's my puck. 

 i found it. finders keepers, losers weepers. 

CHANDLER:
 you gotta do it, man. 

ROSS:
  glue, whatever puck. 

 no. 

ROSS:
 'yes', how about. c'mere. gimme! 

 no! no!   

 hey! hey! no rough holding in my er! 

ROSS:

ROSS:
 ...now that was fun.  closing credits  

ROSS:
  red. 

MONICA:
 could've played monopoly, but nooooo.    

CHANDLER:
 thanks. 

ROSS:
 okay, pheebs: right hand blue.  good.  

CHANDLER:
 hello? oh, uh, rachel, it's the visa card people. 

RACHEL:
 oh, okay. will you take my place? 

CHANDLER:
 alright. 

RACHEL:
 nooo!    been using it much. 

ROSS:
 green. to the green. 

RACHEL:
  never-never mind. 

CHANDLER:
 to the left, to the left- aww!   

MONICA:
 would you let it go? it's not that big a deal.

ROSS:
 not that big a deal? it's amazing. ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. all right, as far as i'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. am i right?

RACHEL:
 come on! you guys can pee standing up.

CHANDLER:
 we can? all right, i'm tryin' that.

JOEY:
 ok, you know what blows my mind? women can see breasts any time they want. you just look down and there they are. how you get any work done is beyond me.

PHOEBE:
 oh, ok, you know what i don't get? the way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care. 

ROSS:
 multiple orgasms! opening credits 

CHANDLER:
 so, saturday night, the big night, date night, saturday night, sat-ur-day night!

JOEY:
 no plans, huh?

CHANDLER:
 not a one.

ROSS:
 not even, say, breaking up with janice?

CHANDLER:
 oh, right, right, shut up.

MONICA:
 chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just gotta do it.

CHANDLER:
 no, i know, but it's just so hard, you know? i mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.

JOEY:
 why do you have to break up with her? be a man, just stop calling. 

PHOEBE:
 you know, if you want, i'll do it with you.

CHANDLER:
 oh, thanks, but i think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. 

PHOEBE:
 no, i mean you break up with janice and i'll break up with tony. 

ROSS:
 tony?

MONICA:
 oh, you're breaking up with tony?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? i don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, i don't know.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 it's my father. he wants to give me a mercedes convertible.

ROSS:
 that guy, he burns me up.

RACHEL:
 yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady.

CHANDLER:
 ooh, i hate when my father calls me that.

MONICA:
 did he give you that whole "you're-not-up-to-this" thing again?

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah, yeah. actually, i got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "you'll never make it on your own".

PHOEBE:
  

 hi, joey.

JOEY:
 my god, angela. 

MONICA:
 wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.

PHOEBE:
 are you gonna go over there?

JOEY:
 no, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. i don't wanna seem too eager. one mississippi, two mississippi, three mississippi. that seems pretty cool.   hey, angela. 

 

JOEY:
 you look good.

 that's because i'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

JOEY:
 you don't say. 

ROSS:
 so, uh, rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?

RACHEL:
 oh, big glamour night. me and monica at laundorama.

ROSS:
 oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? guess who's doing laundry there too?

RACHEL:
 who?

ROSS:
 me. was that not clear? hey, why don't, um, why don't i just join you both, here?

RACHEL:
 don't you have a laundry room in your building?

ROSS:
 yes, i do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. anyway, say, sevenish?

RACHEL:
 sure. 

 forget it joey. i'm with bob now.

JOEY:
 bob? who the hell's bob?

 bob is great. he's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. you, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but bob...

JOEY:
 come on, we were great together. and not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.

 yeah, well, sorry, joe. you said let's just be friends, so guess what?

JOEY:
 what?

 we're just friends.

JOEY:
 fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? you know, as friends?

 what four of us?

JOEY:
 you know, you and bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, monica.  as his girlfriend. his plan is to hook monica up with angela's boyfriend bob and then take 

JOEY:
 monica, i'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.

MONICA:
 forget it. not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

JOEY:
 come on. this guy's great. his name's bob. he's angela's... brother. he's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. me, i go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but bob is...

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 what?

MONICA:
 ugly naked guy's laying kitchen tile. eww!

JOEY:
 eww! look, i'm asking a favor here. if i do this for her brother, maybe angela will come back to me.

MONICA:
 what's going on here? you go out with tons of girls.

JOEY:
  with her. will you help me? please? 

ROSS:
  be me and rachel.

CHANDLER:
 oh. well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?

ROSS:
 it's laundry. the thinking through is minimal.

CHANDLER:
 it's just you and rachel, just the two of you? this is a date. you're going on a date.

ROSS:
 nuh-uh.

CHANDLER:
 yuh-huh.

ROSS:
 so what're you saying here? i should shave again, pick up some wine, what?

CHANDLER:
 well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. this is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh, and uh, the fabric softener?

ROSS:
 ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles? what, it says i'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. ok, i can pick something else up on the way.

CHANDLER:
 there you go.  

MONICA:
 thank you. so what does this bob guy look like? is he tall? short?

JOEY:
 yep.

MONICA:
 which?

JOEY:
 which what?

MONICA:
 you've never met bob, have you?

JOEY:
 no, but he's...

MONICA:
 oh my god, joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly... 

 hey, joey.

MONICA:
 ...horribly attractive. i'll be shutting up now.  

CHANDLER:
 where are they? where are they?

PHOEBE:
 this is nice. we never do anything just the two of us.

CHANDLER:
 it's great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.

PHOEBE:
 eww, i don't wanna do that. 

CHANDLER:
 here we go.

PHOEBE:
 ok, have a good break-up.

CHANDLER:
 hey, janice.

 oh, my god, i am so glad you called me. i had the most supremely awful day.

CHANDLER:
 hey, that's not good. can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please?

 we got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, i blew off the rest of the day, and i went shopping... i'm looking, i got you...  

CHANDLER:
 what?

 what?

CHANDLER:
 

 i got you...these. 

CHANDLER:
 bullwinkle socks. that's so sweet.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 what's that?

ROSS:
 uberveiss. it's new, it's german, it's extra-tough. 

ROSS:
 rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?

RACHEL:
 oh god. oh, am i being like a total laundry spaz? i mean, am i supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? 

ROSS:
 rach, have you never done this before?

RACHEL:
 well, not myself, but i know other people that have. ok, you caught me. i'm a laundry virgin.

ROSS:
 uh, well, don't worry, i'll use the gentle cycle. ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.

RACHEL:
  are white cotton panties. would they go with whites or delicates?

ROSS:
  

MONICA:

 brooklyn heights.

 cleveland.

MONICA:

JOEY:
 i suddenly had the feeling that i was falling. but i'm not. commercial break 

JOEY:
 so, you and angela, huh?

 yep. pretty much.

JOEY:
 you're a lucky man. you know what i miss the most about her? that cute nibbly noise when she eats. like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.

 huh, i never really noticed.

JOEY:
 oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.

 monica, monica is great.

JOEY:
 yeah, but it's not gonna last. she's too much for me in bed. sexually. 

MONICA:
 i've gotta tell you, bob is terrific.

 yeah, isn't he?

MONICA:
 it is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.

 you know what else? he's unbelievable in bed.

MONICA:
 wow. my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.

 huh. that's nice. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, you can do this. it's just like pulling off a band-aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. 

CHANDLER:
 janice. hi, janice. ok, here we go. i don't think we should go out anymore. janice.

 all right. well, there you go.   stop it, stop it, stop it. 

RACHEL:
 ok, i know this is gonna sound really stupid, but i feel that if i can do this, you know, if i can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything i can't do.

ROSS:
 that does not sound stupid to me. you know, it's like the first time i had to make dinner for myself, after carol left me?  sorry, that's all the time we have. next on ross...

RACHEL:
 what uh-oh?

ROSS:
  a song. the laundry song that we sing. 

RACHEL:
 ross, what's the matter?

ROSS:
 nothing, nothing. lee-lo, the laundry's done.

RACHEL:
 come on, show me.

ROSS:
 all right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.

RACHEL:
 oh, everything's pink.

ROSS:
 yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. i'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.

RACHEL:
 except it didn't. it happened to me. oh, god, i'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. what am i doing? what am i doing? my father's right. i can't live on my own! i can't even do laundry!   

MONICA:
 something went wrong with underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. so anyway, um, his head is like flopping down broadway, right, and i'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. um, i've got something in my eye, uh, joey, could we check it in the light, please?  

MONICA:
 oh my god.

JOEY:
 what?

MONICA:
 hello! were we at the same table? it's like... cocktails in appalachia.

JOEY:
 come on, they're close.

MONICA:
 close? she's got her tongue in his ear.

JOEY:
 oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with ross.

MONICA:
 joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?

JOEY:
 well, who's to say what's true? i mean...

MONICA:
 oh my god, what were you thinking?

JOEY:
 all right, look, i'm not proud of this, ok? well, maybe i am a little.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 ow!

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 wait, wait, wait. you want him, i want her. he likes you.

MONICA:
 really?

JOEY:
 yeah. i'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.  

MONICA:
 i'm so sorry, i can't believe i did this, but i couldn't stop laughing at your norman mailer story.  

JOEY:
 uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.  

CHANDLER:
 here's the thing, janice. you know, i mean, it's like we're different. i'm like the bing, bing, bing. you're like the boom, boom,  ... boom.

 ow!

CHANDLER:
 oh, my god, i'm so sorry. are you ok?

 ow. um, it's just my lens. it's just my lens. i'll be right back. 

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh, i guess. except everything looks like jammies now. 

RACHEL:
 whoa, i'm sorry. excuse me. we had this cart.

 yeah, well, i had a 24-inch waist. you lose things. now come on, get outta my way. 

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 oh, he needed some time to grieve. 

CHANDLER:
 i'm free! i'm free!

RACHEL:
  picture! this is so exciting!

CHANDLER:
 you can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...

PHOEBE:
 the exclamation point in the title scares me.  not just freud, it's freud! 

ROSS:
 oh, shhh, shh. magic is about to happen. 

JOEY:
 vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.   all you want is a dingle,   what you envy's a schwang,   a thing through which you can tinkle,   or play with, or simply let hang...   opening credits  

RACHEL:
 god. i feel violated.

MONICA:
 did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 is it? feels like two.

CHANDLER:
 no, ten o'clock.

ROSS:
 what?

CHANDLER:
  nine, ten o'clock!

ROSS:
 oh. hel-lo!

CHANDLER:
 she's amazing! she makes the women that i dream about look like short, fat, bald men!

MONICA:
 well, go over to her! she's not with anyone.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'excuse me. blarrglarrghh.'

RACHEL:
 oh, c'mon. she's a person, you can do it!

CHANDLER:
 oh please, could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up here.

ROSS:
 he could never get a woman like that in a million years.

CHANDLER:
 thank you, buddy.

PHOEBE:
 oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.

MONICA:
 you could do that!

CHANDLER:
 y'think?

 yeah!

CHANDLER:
 oh god, i can't believe i'm even considering this... i'm very very aware of my tongue...

ROSS:
 c'mon! c'mon!

CHANDLER:
 here goes. 

 ...yes?

CHANDLER:
 hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... chandler! chandler is my name, and, uh...

 yes, you said that.

CHANDLER:
 yes, yes i did, but what i didn't say was what i was about to say, what i wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. 

 chandler? 

 hey! you're in a play! i didn't know you could dance! you had a beard!

JOEY:
 whadja think? 

 ...hey! you're in a play! i didn't know you could dance! you had a beard!

JOEY:
 c'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. it was better than that thing i did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.

 

CHANDLER:
  man. whoah.  'chand-lrr'. 'chand-lrr'. i think i like it better that way.  usher gave me this to give to you. 

RACHEL:
 what is it?

JOEY:
 the estelle leonard talent agency. wow, an agency left me its card! maybe they wanna sign me!

PHOEBE:
 based on this play? ...based on this play! 

CHANDLER:
 hey, kids. 

 hey.

PHOEBE:
  just a line.

CHANDLER:
 well, i can't believe i've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.

MONICA:
 oh, right, right. how was your date, 'chand-lrr'?

CHANDLER:
 it was unbelievable. i-i've never met anyone like her. she's had the most amazing life! she was in the israeli army...  

 ...luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. so, we made it to the border, but just barely, and i- ...i've been talking about myself all night long, i'm sorry. what about you? tell me one of your stories.

CHANDLER:
 alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to brooklyn... just for the hell of it.

CHANDLER:
 we talked 'til like two. it was this perfect evening... more or less.

 ...all of a sudden we realised we were in yammon. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, i'm sorry, so 'we' is?

 'we' would be me and rick.

JOEY:
 who's rick?

CHANDLER:
 who's rick?

 my husband.

 ooooohhh.

CHANDLER:
 oh, so you're divorced?

 no.

CHANDLER:
 oh, i'm sorry, then you're widowed?...hopefully?

 no, i'm still married.

CHANDLER:
 so tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?

 don't worry. i imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with ethan.

CHANDLER:
 ethan? there's, there's an ethan?

 mmmm... ethan is my... boyfriend.

 what?!

CHANDLER:
 so explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?

 i suppose mainly sexual.

CHANDLER:
 ...hm.

MONICA:
 oh. i'm sorry it didn't work out.

CHANDLER:
 what 'not work out'? i'm seeing her again on thursday. didn't you listen to the story?

MONICA:
 didn't you listen to the story? i mean, this is twisted! how could you get involved with a woman like this?

CHANDLER:
 well, y'know, i had some trouble with it at first too, but the way i

 all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. i mean, this is every guy's fantasy!

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah. that is not true. ross, is this your fantasy?

ROSS:
 no, of course not! 

MONICA:
 what? so you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?

JOEY:
 i couldn't do it.

MONICA:
 good for you, joey.

JOEY:
 when i'm with a woman, i need to know that i'm going out with more people than she is.

ROSS:
 well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. i mean, anthropologically speaking- 

ROSS:
 fine. fine, alright, now you'll never know.

MONICA:
 we're kidding. c'mon, tell us!

 yeah! c'mon!

ROSS:
 alright. there's a theory, put forth by richard leakey-  

RACHEL:
 tah-daaah!

CHANDLER:
 are we greeting each other this way now? 'cause i like that.

RACHEL:
 look! i cleaned! i did the windows, i did the floors... i even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, i don't know what that's for.

ROSS:
 oh yeah, nobody knows. and we're not supposed to ask.

RACHEL:
 well, whaddya think?

 very clean! it looks great! terrific!

MONICA:
 ...oh! i-i see you moved the green ottoman.

 uh-oh...

MONICA:
 how-how did that happen?

RACHEL:
 i dunno.. i-i thought it looked better there. and i- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.

MONICA:
 yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  well, it looks good there too. let's just leave it there for a while.

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 thank god you didn't try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.

MONICA:
 you guys, i am not that bad!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you are, monica. remember when i lived with you? you were like, a little, y'know, 

MONICA:
 that is so unfair!

ROSS:
 oh c'mon! when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn't raggedy!

MONICA:
 okay, so i'm responsible, i'm organised. but hey, i can be a kook.

ROSS:
 alright, you madcap gal. try to imagine this. the phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.

MONICA:
 why not?

ROSS:
 because you're a kook! instead you wait until they send you a notice.

MONICA:
 i could do that.

RACHEL:
 okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and i buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.

MONICA:
 why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder.

CHANDLER:
 someone's left a glass on the coffee table. there's no coaster. it's a cold drink, it's a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...

MONICA:
 stop it!! ...oh my god. it's true! who am i?

ROSS:
 monica? you're mom. 

PHOEBE:
 ree! ree! ree! ree! ree! 

JOEY:
   that was my agent.  just gotten me a job...in the new al pacino movie!

 oh my god! whoah!

MONICA:
 well, what's the part?

JOEY:
 can you believe this? al pacino! this guy's the reason i became an actor! "i'm out of order? pfeeeh. you're out of order! this whole courtroom's out of order!"

PHOEBE:
 seriously, what-what's the part?

JOEY:
 "just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in!"

ROSS:
 c'mon, seriously, joey, what's the part?

JOEY:
 ...i'm his 

RACHEL:
 ..you're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?

JOEY:
 ...i'm his butt double. 'kay? i play al pacino's butt. alright? he goes into the shower, and then- i'm his butt.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big!

CHANDLER:
 oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.

JOEY:
 okay, okay, fine! make jokes, i don't care! this is a big break for me!

ROSS:
 you're right, you're right, it is...so you gonna invite us all to the big opening? commercial break 

MONICA:
 alright, alright, alright...  

JOEY:
 here. i need to borrow some moisturizer.

MONICA:
 for what?

JOEY:
 whaddya think? today's the big day!

MONICA:
 oh my god. okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.

JOEY:
 thank you!  

CHANDLER:
 where's joey? his mom's on the phone.

MONICA:
 he's in the bathroom. i don't think you wanna go in there!

CHANDLER:
 c'mon, we're roommates!   my eyes!! my eyes!!

MONICA:
 i warned you... 

RACHEL:
 who is being loud?

CHANDLER:
 oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i wanna borrow a coupla things, aurora spent the night, i really wanna make her breakfast.

MONICA:
 oh, you got the whole night, huh?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know..  

RACHEL:
 ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment?

CHANDLER:
 no, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? well, every- single- second is like that with aurora.. and i've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. monica, can you help me with the door? 

MONICA:
 sure. oh, um, chandler? y'know, the-the old monica would-would remind you to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush...but i'm not gonna do that.   

  okay, everybody ready?

JOEY:
 uh, listen, i just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.

 lose the robe.

JOEY:
 me?

 that would work.

JOEY:
 right. okay. losing the robe.  lost.

 okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. let's roll it.. water's working  

 and cut. hey, butt guy, what the hell are you doing?

JOEY:
 well, i'm- i'm showering.

 no, that was clenching.

JOEY:
 oh. well, the way i see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? i mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... i think his butt would be angry here.

 i think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. what was that?

JOEY:
 i was going for quiet desperation. but if you have to ask... 

CHANDLER:
 god, i love these fingers...

 thank you.

CHANDLER:
 no, actually i meant my fingers. look at 'em, look at how happy they are.

  

CHANDLER:
 oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..  

 okay.

CHANDLER:
 don't go.

 okay. oh no, i have to.

CHANDLER:
 

 

CHANDLER:
 well, i thought- i thought you talked to rick.

 it's not rick.

CHANDLER:
 what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you!

 no, it's-it's andrew. 

CHANDLER:
 i know there'll be many moments in the years to come when i'll regret asking the following question, but- and andrew is?

 he's... new.

CHANDLER:
 oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?

 no, that's not exactly what i was..

CHANDLER:
 well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.

 so what do you want?

CHANDLER:
 you.

 you have me!

CHANDLER:
 nono, just you.

 whaddyou mean?

CHANDLER:
 lose the other guys.

 ...like, ...all of them?

CHANDLER:
 c'mon, we're great together, why not?

 why can't we just have what we have now? why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight i thought that's what you wanted too.

CHANDLER:
 ...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like i'm two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there's this other guy. actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... and he's saying, y'know, 'this is too hard! get out! get out!'

 so... which one of the two guys will you listen to?

CHANDLER:
 i don't know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...

 which one?

CHANDLER:
 ...the second guy.

  

CHANDLER:
 sorry, the first guy runs the lips.  

ROSS:
 look at it this way: you dumped her. right? i mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... tell me why you did this again? 

 hey!

MONICA:
 hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new al pacino movie?

JOEY:
 nope.

ROSS:
 no? what happened, big guy?

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 it felt like a 'big guy' moment.

JOEY:
 i got fired.

 oh!

JOEY:
 yeah, they said i acted too much with it. i told everybody about this! now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...

RACHEL:
 oh, joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.

JOEY:
 my mom will.

CHANDLER:
 something so sweet and...disturbing about that.

JOEY:
 y'know, i've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. and i finally get my shot, and i blow it!

MONICA:
 maybe this wasn't your shot.

ROSS:
 yeah, i mean... i think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. did it... feel like your shot..?

JOEY:
 hard to tell, i was naked.

PHOEBE:
 no, i don't think this was your shot. i mean, i don't even think you just get one shot. i really believe big things are gonna happen for you, i do! you've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'i got the part! i got the part! i'm gonna be joey tribbiani's ass!'.

JOEY:
 yeah? that's so nice!  

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, joey. i'm gonna go to bed, guys.

RACHEL:
 uh, mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with. yeah, thanks.  

MONICA:
 hello?

CHANDLER:
 hey, it's me.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i'm fine.  atm vstbl wth jll gdcr.

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 i'm trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr!

MONICA:
 i have no idea what you just said.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 what's up man?

CHANDLER:
 i'm trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr.

JOEY:
  goodacre! 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.  

RACHEL:
 alright, somebody.

MONICA:
 ok, i'll go. ok, senior year of college... on a pool table.

 whoooaa!

ROSS:
 that's my sister.

JOEY:
 ok... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library.

MONICA:
 oh my god! what were you doing in a library?

ROSS:
 pheebs, what about you?

PHOEBE:
 oh... milwaukee.

RACHEL:
 um... ross?

ROSS:
 disneyland, 1989, 'it's a small world after all.'

 no way!

ROSS:
 the ride broke down. so, carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom.

PHOEBE:
 oh, rachel.

RACHEL:
 oh come on, i already went.

MONICA:
 you did not go!

 come on.

RACHEL:
 oh, alright. the weirdest place would have to be...  foot of the bed. 

ROSS:
 step back.

JOEY:
 we have a winner!  

RACHEL:
 i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.

ROSS:
 well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.

RACHEL:
 there, well, see? barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. 

ROSS:
 come on.

RACHEL:
 no, he said we were holding up the people behind us.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 i mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...

ROSS:
 probably. but you know, i'll tell you something. passion is way overrated. 

RACHEL:
 yeah right.

ROSS:
 it is. eventually, it kind of... burns out. but hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. so, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 but, um... i don't think that's going to be you.

RACHEL:
 you don't.

ROSS:
 uh-uh. see, i see.... big passion in your future.

RACHEL:
 really?

ROSS:
 mmmm.

RACHEL:
 you do?

ROSS:
 i do.

RACHEL:
 oh ross, you're so great.  

JOEY:
 it's never gonna happen.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 you and rachel.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. 

ROSS:
 no, no, no. i'm not in the zone.

JOEY:
 ross, you're mayor of the zone.

ROSS:
 i'm taking my time, alright? i'm laying the groundwork. yeah. i mean, every day i get just a little bit closer to...

JOEY:
 priesthood! look ross, i'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. if you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.

ROSS:
 i will, i will. see, i'm waiting for the right moment.  what? what, now?

JOEY:
 yeeeeaaaahhh! what's messing you up? the wine? the candles? the moonlight? you've just got to go up to her and say, 'rachel, i think that...'  

ROSS:
 shhhh!

RACHEL:
 what are you shushing?

ROSS:
 we're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. listen. 

RACHEL:
 ahhhh!

ROSS:
 see?

RACHEL:
 huh.  

 would you like some gum?

CHANDLER:
 um, is it sugarless?

 

CHANDLER:
 oh, then no thanks. what the hell was that? mental note: if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it. if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it. 

PHOEBE:
  to me it is not scary, 'cause i stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...  

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 are you going to do it?

ROSS:
 i'm going to do it.

JOEY:
 do you want any help?

ROSS:
 you come out there, you're a dead man.

JOEY:
 good luck, man.

ROSS:
 thanks. 

JOEY:
 ok.  

JOEY:
 hey, where are you going?

MONICA:
 outside.

JOEY:
 you can't go out there.

MONICA:
 why not?

JOEY:
 because of... the reason.

MONICA:
 and that would be?

JOEY:
 i, um, can't tell you.

MONICA:
 joey, what's going on?

JOEY:
 ok, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell ross that i told you.

MONICA:
 about what?

JOEY:
 he's planning your birthday party.

MONICA:
 oh my god! i love him!

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 about what?

MONICA:
 my surprise party!

PHOEBE:
 what surprise party?

MONICA:
 oh stop it. joey already told me.

PHOEBE:
 well, he didn't tell me.

JOEY:
 hey, don't look at me. this is ross's thing.

PHOEBE:
 this is so typical. i'm always the last one to know everything.

MONICA:
 no, you are not. we tell you stuff.

PHOEBE:
 yuh-huh! i was the last one to know when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. i was the last one to know when you had a crush on joey when he was moving in.  like i was second to last. 

RACHEL:
 hmmm... this is so nice.

ROSS:
 ok, i have a question. well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.

RACHEL:
 ok.

ROSS:
 ok. here goes. for a while now, i've been wanting to, um....

RACHEL:
 ohhh!!!! 

ROSS:
 yes, yes, that's right...

RACHEL:
 oh, look at the little cat! 

ROSS:
 what?   

  looking down on creation and the only explanation i can find, is the wonders i've found ever since... commercial break  

MONICA:
  

JOEY:
 sorry, that was wax.

PHOEBE:
 oh, poor little tooty is scared to death. we should find his owner.

ROSS:
 why don't we just put 'poor little tooty' out in the hall?

RACHEL:
 during a blackout? he'd get trampled!

ROSS:
  

CHANDLER:
 you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.   'gum would be perfection'? 'gum would be perfection.' could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'i'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. for me, gum is perfection. i loathe myself.  

PHOEBE:
  right?

RACHEL:
 oh.  this cat and we're looking for the owner.

 er, yeah, it's mine.

PHOEBE:
  sure?

 yeah, it's my cat. give me my cat.

PHOEBE:
 wait a minute. what's his name?

 ehhhh... b-buttons.

RACHEL:
 bob buttons?

 mmm. bob buttons. here, bob buttons.

PHOEBE:
 

  

RACHEL:
 here, kitty-kitty. here kitty-kitty. where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...  gets up and sees a gorgeous italian hunk holding the cat. who, by the way, you'll hate 

 

RACHEL:
 wow.  

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
  want you to meet my friends. this is monica.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 and joey....

MONICA:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 and ross.

MONICA:
 hi!

 

RACHEL:
 

 

RACHEL:
 look at that!

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 oh... italy, i think.

ROSS:
 no, i mean tonight, in the building. suddenly. into our lives.

RACHEL:
 well, the cat... the cat turned out to be paolo's cat!

ROSS:
 that, that is funny...  

PHOEBE:
 alright. i looked all over the building and i couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

RACHEL:
 oh, i found him. he was paolo's cat.

PHOEBE:
 ah! well! there you go! last to know again! and i'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is paolo.

RACHEL:
 ah, paolo, this is phoebe.

 

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
  good. it's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. here we go.  

CHANDLER:
 nice going, imp. ok, it's ok. all i need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.  

CHANDLER:
 good save! we're back on track, and i'm...  someone else's gum. this is not my gum. oh my god! oh my god! and now you're choking.  

 are you alright?  

 my god, you're choking!   that better?

CHANDLER:
 

 perfection?  

 

ROSS:
  

ROSS:
 wha-what did he say that was so funny?

RACHEL:
 i have absolutely no idea.

ROSS:
 that's... that's classic.

RACHEL:
  doing? this is so un-me!

MONICA:
 if you want, i'll do it. 

PHOEBE:
 i know, i just want to bite his bottom lip.  won't.

RACHEL:
 god, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in bermuda with barry.

PHOEBE:
 you know, did you ride mopeds? 'cause i've heard...  ... oh, i see... it's not about that right now. ok.

RACHEL:
 y'know, i know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but goooooooddddddd....  

ROSS:
 paolo. hi.

 ross!  

ROSS:
 listen. um, listen. something you should... know... um, rachel and i... we're kind of a thing.

 thing?

ROSS:
 thing, yes. thing.

 ah, you... have the sex?

ROSS:
 no, no, no. technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. see, um, the point is that... rachel and i should be, er, together. you know, and if you get in the.... um... 

 bed?

ROSS:
 no, no, that's not where i was going. er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then i would be, well, very sad.

 oh!

ROSS:
 yeah! se vice?

 si.

ROSS:
 so you do know a little english.

 poco... a leetle.

ROSS:
 do you know the word crapweasel?

 no.

ROSS:
 that's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!   dangling from their chains in front of them. jill is showing chandler how to swing the pen 

 chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! now watch, it's easy.

CHANDLER:
 ok.

 ready?  

 no, you've got to whip it.   

PHOEBE:
 oh, look look look. the last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...  

ROSS:
 thank you.

PHOEBE:
 thanks.

ROSS:
 kinda... spooky without any lights.

JOEY:
  

ROSS:
 ok, guys, guys? i have the definitive one. mwwwooooo-hah-hah...  

ROSS:
 oh.. oh... oh.

JOEY:
 hey ross. this probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for monica. closing credits 

 well, this has been fun.

CHANDLER:
 yes. yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.

 well, goodbye chandler. i had a great blackout.   see ya.  

 hey gorgeous, how's it going?

CHANDLER:
 dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?

 question. you're not dating anybody, are you, because i met somebody who would be perfect for you.

CHANDLER:
 ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...

 do you want a date saturday?

CHANDLER:
 yes please.

 okay. he's cute, he's funny, he's-

CHANDLER:
 he's a he?

 well yeah! ...oh god. i- just- i thought- good, shelley. i'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... opening credits 

CHANDLER:
 ...couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. i mean, is that ridiculous? can you believe she actually thought that?

RACHEL:
 um... yeah. well, i mean, when i first met you, y'know, i thought maybe, possibly, you might be... 

CHANDLER:
 you did?

RACHEL:
 yeah, but then you spent phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then i figured maybe not.

CHANDLER:
 huh. did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?

MONICA:
 i did.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i think so, yeah.

JOEY:
 not me.

ROSS:
 nono, me neither. although, uh, y'know, back in college, susan sallidor did.

CHANDLER:
 you're kidding! did you tell her i wasn't?

ROSS:
 no. no, it's just 'cause, uh, i kinda wanted to go out with her too, so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman... who also liked her, so... 

CHANDLER:
 well, this is fascinating. so, uh, what is it about me?

PHOEBE:
 i dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...

CHANDLER:
 ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?

 yeah! right!

CHANDLER:
 what is it?!

MONICA:
 okay, i-i d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.

 yes. absolutely. a quality.

CHANDLER:
 oh, oh, a quality, good, because i was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this. 

MONICA:
 hello? hello? oh! rachel, it's paolo calling from rome. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god! calling from rome!  

ROSS:
  rome.

RACHEL:
 monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? talking to rome. 

MONICA:
 hey dad, what's up?   

ROSS:
 so, uh, how's she doing?

 the doctor says it's a matter of hours.

MONICA:
 how-how are you, mom?

 me? i'm fine, fine. i'm glad you're here. ...what's with your hair?

MONICA:
 what?

 what's different?

MONICA:
 nothing.

 oh, maybe that's it. 

MONICA:
 she is unbelievable, our mother is...

ROSS:
 okay, relax, relax. we are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.

MONICA:
 oh god!  

MONICA:
 the fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 

ROSS:
 oh! ...yeah, they were gross. oh, you know what i loved? her sweet 'n' los. how she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.

 not just restaurants, from our house. 

 mrs. geller? 

ROSS:
 she looks so small. 

MONICA:
 i know.

ROSS:
 well, at least she's with pop-pop and aunt phyllis now. 

MONICA:
 g'bye, nana. 

ROSS:
 bye, nana.   

MONICA:
 ross! 

 what is going on?!

ROSS:
 y'know how-how the nurse said that-that nana had passed? well, she's not, quite..

 what?

ROSS:
 she's not- past, she's present, she's back.

 

 she may have died.

 she may have died?

 we're looking into it. 

ROSS:
 i, uh, i'll go see. 

 this almost never happens!  

ROSS:
 now she's passed. 

CHANDLER:
 i just have to know, okay. is it my hair?

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you have homosexual hair. 

RACHEL:
 so, um, did she...

ROSS:
 twice.

JOEY:
 twice?

PHOEBE:
 oh, that sucks!

JOEY:
 you guys okay?

ROSS:
 i dunno, it's weird. i mean, i know she's gone, but i just don't feel, uh...

PHOEBE:
 maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.

ROSS:
 nono, she's gone.

MONICA:
 we checked. a lot.

PHOEBE:
 hm, i mean maybe no-one ever really goes. ever since my mom died, every now and then, i get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?   oh! and debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- i always get this really strong debbie vibe whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...i miss her.

RACHEL:
 aw. hey, pheebs, want this? 

PHOEBE:
 thanks!

RACHEL:
 sure. i just sharpened her this morning.

JOEY:
 now, see, i don't believe any of that. i think once you're dead, you're dead! you're gone! you're worm food!  huh?

PHOEBE:
 y'know, i dunno who this is, but it's not debbie.   

ROSS:
 i thought it was gonna be a closed casket.

 well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice! 

 sweetie, you think you can get in there?

ROSS:
   

ROSS:
 here's my retainer! 

 i was just thinking. when my time comes-

MONICA:
 dad!

 listen to me! when my time comes, i wanna be buried at sea.

MONICA:
 you what?

 i wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. 

MONICA:
 define fun.

 c'mon, you'll make a day of it! you'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...

MONICA:
 ...and then we throw your body in the water... gee, that does sound fun.

 everyone thinks they know me. everyone says 'jack geller, so predictable'. maybe after i'm gone, they'll say 'buried at sea! huh!'.

MONICA:
 that's probably what they'll say.

 i'd like that. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, gorgeous.

 

CHANDLER:
 no, nono, don't- don't worry about it. believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.

 oh! okay! phew! 

CHANDLER:
 so, uh... what do you think it is about me?

 i dunno, uh... you just have a-a...

CHANDLER:
 ...quality, right, great.

 y'know, it's a shame, because you and lowell would've made a great couple.

CHANDLER:
 lowell? financial services' lowell, that's who you saw me with?

 what? he's cute!

CHANDLER:
 well, yeah... 's'no brian in payroll.

 is brian...?

CHANDLER:
 no! uh, i d'know! the point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, i'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.

 well, i think brian's a little out of your league.

CHANDLER:
 excuse me? you don't think i could get a brian? because i could get a brian. believe you me. ...i'm really not. 

ROSS:
 

 no.

ROSS:
 i have shown you everything we have. unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.

 you know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.

 you're right. we'll go with the burgundy.

ROSS:
 oh! a fine choice. i'm coming out. 

 wait! we need shoes! 

ROSS:
 okay. um, how about these? 

 that's really a day shoe.

ROSS:
 and where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?

 could we see something in a slimmer heel?

ROSS:
  i can show you something in a silver that may work.

 no, it really should be burgundy.

 mm. unless we go with a different dress?

ROSS:
 no! nonono, wait a sec. i may have something in the back.  

ROSS:
 oh my god..

 is everything all right, dear?

ROSS:
 yeah, just... just nana stuff.   commercial break 

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. did you know my ears are not my best feature?

ROSS:
 some days it's all i can think about. 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, you-you mean your earrings?

PHOEBE:
 what'd i say?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 are these the shoes?

RACHEL:
 yes. paolo sent them from italy.

ROSS:
 what, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...it's stuff like that, isn't it?  

MONICA:
 it was a really beautiful service.

 it really was. oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  it might be time for you to start using night cream. 

JOEY:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent mussberger.

JOEY:
 check it out, giants-cowboys. 

CHANDLER:
 you're watching a football game at a funeral?

JOEY:
 no, it's the pre-game. i'm gonna watch it at the reception.

CHANDLER:
 you are a frightening, frightening man. 

RACHEL:
 oh no! my new paolo shoes!

ROSS:
 oh, i hope they're not ruined.

PHOEBE:
 god, what a great day. ...what? weather-wise!

ROSS:
 i know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- i dunno, almost life-aff-  

 god! ross!

ROSS:
 i'm fine. just-just... having my worst fear realised...  

PHOEBE:
 okay, don't worry, i'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.

ROSS:
 what, what is it?

PHOEBE:
 you missed a belt loop. 

ROSS:
 oh! no-n-

PHOEBE:
 okay, it's in spasm.

 here, sweetie, here. i took these when i had my golfing accident.  

CHANDLER:
 oh, no-

 sorry- hi, i'm dorothy's daughter.

CHANDLER:
 hi, i'm chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is.  

PHOEBE:
 hey, look who's up! how do you feel?

ROSS:
 i feel great. i feel- great, i fleel great.

MONICA:
 wow, those pills really worked, huh?

ROSS:
 not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...i love you guys. you guys are the greatest. i love my sister 

PHOEBE:
 ooh! that's so nice...

ROSS:
 ...chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

ROSS:
  me.

 

ROSS:
 rachel. rachel rachel. 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 no.

RACHEL:
 you!

ROSS:
 oh.. you don't get it!   

 whaddya got there?

JOEY:
  disability.

 what's the score?

JOEY:
 seventeen-fourteen giants... three minutes to go in the third.

 beautiful!  

RACHEL:
 

 

MONICA:
 well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.

 no, i'd be hearing about 'why didn't i get the honey-glazed ham?', i didn't spend enough on flowers, and if i spent more she'd be saying 'why are you wasting your money? i don't need flowers, i'm dead'.

MONICA:
 that sounds like nana.

 do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?

MONICA:
 ...i can imagine.

 i'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.

MONICA:
 that is a wonder. so tell me something, mom. if you had to do it all over again, i mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?

 tell her what?

MONICA:
 how she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.

 i'm not sure i know what you're getting at.

MONICA:
 do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?

 ...no. i think some things are better left unsaid. i think it's nicer when people just get along. 

MONICA:
 huh.

 more wine, dear?

MONICA:
 oh, i think so.

  those earrings look really lovely on you.

MONICA:
 thank you. they're yours.

 actually they were nana's. 

 now i'm depressed! ... 

RACHEL:
 hey, who's this little naked guy?

ROSS:
 that little naked guy would be me.

RACHEL:
 aww, look at the little thing.

ROSS:
 yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. can we be grown-ups now?

CHANDLER:
 who are those people?

ROSS:
 got me.

MONICA:
 oh, that's nana, right there in the middle.  gang at java joe's'. 

RACHEL:
 wow, monica, you look just like your grandmother. how old was she there?

MONICA:
 let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?

ROSS:
 looks like a fun gang. 

JOEY:
 ooh, look-look-look-look-look! i got monica naked!

ROSS:
  closing credits 

CHANDLER:
 hey, lowell.

 hey, chandler.

CHANDLER:
 so how's it going there in financial services?

 it's like mardi gras without the paper mache heads. how 'bout you?

CHANDLER:
 good, good. listen, heh, i dunno what shelley told you about me, but, uh... i'm not.

 i know. that's what i told her.

CHANDLER:
 really.

 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 so- you can tell?

 pretty much, most of the time. we have a kind of... radar.

CHANDLER:
 so you don't think i have a, a quality?

 speaking for my people, i'd have to say no. by the way, your friend brian from payroll, he is.

CHANDLER:
 he is?

 yup, and waaay out of your league. 

RACHEL:
 terry, i, i, i know that i haven't worked here very long, but i was wondering, do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance in my salary?

 an advance?

RACHEL:
 it's so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family. see, every year we go skiing in vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but i sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why i took this job.

 rachel, rachel, sweetheart. you're a terrible, terrible waitress. really, really awful.

RACHEL:
 ok, i, i hear what you're sayin'. i'm with you. um, but i, but i'm trying really hard. and i think i'm doing better. i really do. does anybody need coffee?  opening credits 

RACHEL:
 excuse me, sir. hi, you come in here all time. i was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?

 huh?

RACHEL:
 ok, ok, that's fine. fine. hey, i'm sorry about that spill before.  

MONICA:
 hey. ross, did you know mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving?

ROSS:
 no, they're not.

MONICA:
 yes, they are. the blymens invited them.

ROSS:
 you're wrong.

MONICA:
 i am not wrong.

ROSS:
 you're wrong.

MONICA:
 no, i just talked to them.

ROSS:
  

JOEY:
 hey, hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 and this from the cry-for-help department. are you wearing makeup?

JOEY:
 yes, i am. as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor slash model.

CHANDLER:
 that's so funny, 'cause i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man slash woman.

PHOEBE:
 what were you modeling for?

JOEY:
 you know those posters for the city free clinic?

MONICA:
 oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?

PHOEBE:
 you know, the asthma guy was really cute.

CHANDLER:
 do you know which one you're gonna be?

JOEY:
 no, but i hear lyme disease is open, so... 

CHANDLER:
 good luck, man. i hope you get it.

JOEY:
 thanks. 

ROSS:
  thanksgiving. 

MONICA:
 ok, i'll tell you what. how about i cook dinner at my place? i'll make it just like mom's.

ROSS:
 will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?

MONICA:
 you know, they're not actually supposed to have...   i'll work on the lumps. joey, you're going home, right?

JOEY:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 and i assume, chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.

CHANDLER:
 yes, every single one of them.

MONICA:
 phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?

PHOEBE:
 yes, and her boyfriend. but we're celebrating thanksgiving in december 'cause he is lunar.

MONICA:
 so you're free thursday, then.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. oh, can i come?

MONICA:
 yeah. rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to vail?

RACHEL:
 absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go.

CHANDLER:
 i thought it was $98.50.

RACHEL:
 yeah, well it was. i, i broke a cup.

ROSS:
 well, i'm off to carol's.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, ooh! why don't we invite her?

ROSS:
  bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. 

ROSS:
 hi, is uh, is carol here?

 no, she's at a faculty meeting.

ROSS:
 oh, i uh, just came by to pick up my skull. well, not mine, but...susan: come in.

ROSS:
 thanks. yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum.

 what's it look like?

ROSS:
 kinda like a big face without skin.

 yes, i'm familiar with the concept. we can just look for it.

ROSS:
 ok.  bein' a lesbian.

 well, you know, you have to take a course. otherwise, they don't let you do it. 

ROSS:
 

 actually, i'm reading it to the baby.

ROSS:
 the uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?

 what, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?

ROSS:
 you're not serious, i mean, you really... you really talk to it?

 yeah, all the time. i want the baby to know my voice.

ROSS:
 do you uh, do you talk about me?

 yeah, yeah, all the time.

ROSS:
 really?

 but um, we just refer to you as bobo the sperm guy. 

ROSS:
 look, if she's talking to it, i just think that i should get some belly time too. not that i believe any of this.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.

CHANDLER:
 i'd just like to say that i'm totally behind this experiment. in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head. 

MONICA:
 hey, rach, did you make your money?

RACHEL:
 no, not even close. forget vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

MONICA:
 rach, here's your mail.

RACHEL:
 thanks, you can just put it on the table.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 thanks, you can just put it on the table.

MONICA:
  

RACHEL:
 oh my god, oh, you guys are great.

MONICA:
 we all chipped in.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 thank you. thank you so much!

MONICA:
  thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of funyuns.

RACHEL:
 wait, wait, chandler, this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday?

CHANDLER:
 all right, i'm nine years old.

ROSS:
 oh, i hate this story.

CHANDLER:
 we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

RACHEL:
 oh my god.

CHANDLER:
 yes. it's very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. 

JOEY:
 uh, hi. we uh, we used to work together.

 we did?

JOEY:
 yeah, at macy's. you were the obsession girl, right? i was the aramis guy. 

 yeah, right.

JOEY:
 i gotta tell you. you're the best in the business.

 get out.

JOEY:
 i'm serious. you're amazing. you know when to spritz, when to lay back.

 really? you don't know what that means to me.

JOEY:
 ooh, you smell great tonight. what're you wearing?

 

JOEY:
 listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?

 yeah. 

JOEY:
 what's wrong?

 i just remembered, i have to do something.

JOEY:
 oh. what?

 um, leave.

JOEY:
 wait, wait, wait!  mario isn't telling you...v.d., you never know who might have it. a variety of scenes are  

JOEY:
 so i guess you all saw it.

RACHEL:
 saw what?

PHOEBE:
 no, we were just laughing. you know, how laughter can be infectious. 

JOEY:
 set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd.

CHANDLER:
 tonight, on a very special blossom. commercial break  

MONICA:
 mmm, looking good. ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. 

ROSS:
 i don't know. it's just not the same without mom in the kitchen.

MONICA:
 all right, that's it. you know what? just get out of my way and stop moping.

ROSS:
 that's closer. 

RACHEL:
 i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.

CHANDLER:
 oh, you must stop shooping.

RACHEL:
 ok, i'm gonna get my stuff.

JOEY:
 chandler, will you just come in already?

CHANDLER:
 no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. 

PHOEBE:
 look out, incoming pumpkin pie!

CHANDLER:
 ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. 

JOEY:
 hey, monica, i got a question. i don't see any tater tots.

MONICA:
 that's not a question.

JOEY:
 but my mom always makes them. it's like a tradition. you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! it's bad enough i can't be with my family because of my disease.

MONICA:
 all right, fine. tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.

ROSS:
 ok, i'm off to talk to my unborn child.  

MONICA:
 ah!

ROSS:
 ok, mom never hit. 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 what, phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? ross needs lumps!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i'm sorry, oh, i just, i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.

MONICA:
 why would we do that?

PHOEBE:
 well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.

MONICA:
 ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.

RACHEL:
 ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything.   oh, sorry! oh, sorry! 

CHANDLER:
 the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away.

JOEY:
 the balloon?

CHANDLER:
 no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. i'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?

RACHEL:
 i can't, i gotta go.

CHANDLER:
 come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen?

PHOEBE:
 almost never.

MONICA:
 got the keys? or got the keys!

RACHEL:
 ok.  

 anytime you're ready.

ROSS:
 ok, ok, here we go.  talking to, here? i mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...

 just aim for the bump.

ROSS:
 ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. you know, i, you know, can't do this. uh, this is too weird. i feel stupid.

 so don't do it, it's fine. you don't have to do it just because susan does it.

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean.

MONICA:
 ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. why are we standing here?

RACHEL:
 we're waiting for you to open the door. you got the keys.

MONICA:
 no i don't.

RACHEL:
 yes, you do. when we left, you said, "got the keys."

MONICA:
 no i didn't. i asked, "got the ke-eys?"

RACHEL:
 no, no, no, you said, "got the keys".

CHANDLER:
 do either of you have the keys?

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, i gotta get my ticket!

JOEY:
 wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.

MONICA:
 well then get it, get it!

JOEY:
 that tone will not make me go any faster.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 that one will.   

ROSS:
 and everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. so, on a dare, i picked paleontology. and you have no idea what i'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. you're just happy you don't have gills anymore.

 look, you don't have to talk to it. you can sing to it if you want.

ROSS:
 oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, ok? 

 hi, how's it goin?

ROSS:
 shh!  looks from, everyone we meet. hey, hey! 

 i did.

ROSS:
 does it always, uh--?

 no, no that was the first.

 keep singing! keep singing!

ROSS:
  you come out i'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.

 i felt it!

ROSS:
  

JOEY:
 nope, not that one.

MONICA:
 can you go any faster with that?

JOEY:
 hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. you do the math.

MONICA:
 why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
  for you and your stupid balloon, i would be on a plane watching a woman do this   right now. but i'm not.

MONICA:
 i swear you said you had the keys.

RACHEL:
 no, i didn't. i wouldn't say i had the keys unless i had the keys, and i obviously didn't have the keys.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, ok, that's it. enough with the keys. no one say keys. 

MONICA:
 why would i have the keys?

RACHEL:
 aside from the fact that you said you had them?

MONICA:
 but i didn't.

RACHEL:
 well, you should have.

MONICA:
 why?

RACHEL:
 because!

MONICA:
 why?

RACHEL:
 because!

MONICA:
 why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes. does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want? nooooo, no, no!  and onions, and mario gets his tots, and it's my first thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and i... i...

CHANDLER:
 ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go. 

MONICA:
 well, the turkey's burnt.  are ruined, potatoes are ruined. 

ROSS:
 here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like mom's.

MONICA:
 no, it doesn't, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross?   well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.

RACHEL:
 oh, god, this is great! the plane is gone, so it looks like i'm stuck here with you guys.

JOEY:
 hey, we all had better plans. this was nobody's first choice.

MONICA:
 oh, really? so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner?

JOEY:
 you call that delicious?  

MONICA:
 stop it, stop it, stop it!

CHANDLER:
 now this feels like thanksgiving. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh. 

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. oh my god. he's not alone. ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal. 

JOEY:
 i've gotta see this. all right ugly naked guy!

MONICA:
 ooh, ugly naked dancing!

PHOEBE:
 it's nice that he has someone. 

CHANDLER:
 shall i carve?

RACHEL:
 by all means.

CHANDLER:
 ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?

ROSS:
 i don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 oh, i will.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, you guys have to make a wish.

MONICA:
 make a wish?

PHOEBE:
 come on, you know, thanksgiving. ooh, you got the bigger half. what'd you wish for?

JOEY:
 the bigger half.

CHANDLER:
 i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.

 that's so sweet.

ROSS:
 and hey, here's to a lousy christmas.

RACHEL:
 and a crappy new year.

CHANDLER:
 here, here! closing credits 

ROSS:
 guys? there's a somebody i'd like you to meet.  

 oooh!

MONICA:
 w-wait. what is that?

ROSS:
 'that' would be marcel. you wanna say hi?

MONICA:
 no, no, i don't.

RACHEL:
 oh, he is precious! where did you get him?

ROSS:
 my friend bethel rescued him from some lab.

PHOEBE:
 that is so cruel! why? why would a parent name their child bethel?

CHANDLER:
 hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass!

MONICA:
 ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?

ROSS:
 yeah. i mean, it's been kinda quiet since carol left, so...

MONICA:
 why don't you just get a roommate?

ROSS:
 nah, i dunno... i think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  cool way to live'. opening credits 

PHOEBE:
 so you guys, i'm doing all new material tonight. i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.

CHANDLER:
 might wanna open with the snowman. 

 hey, joey. hey, buddy.

MONICA:
 so, how'd it go?

JOEY:
 ahhhhhh, i didn't get the job.

ROSS:
 how could you not get it? you were santa last year.

JOEY:
 i dunno. some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. he's not even jolly, it's all political.

MONICA:
 so what are you gonna be?

JOEY:
 ah, i'm gonna be one of his helpers. it's just such a slap in the face, y'know?

RACHEL:
 hey, do you guys know what you're doing for new year's?   gee, what?! what is wrong with new year's?

CHANDLER:
 nothing for you, you have paolo. you don't have to face the horrible

 desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! man, i'm talking loud!

RACHEL:
 well, for your information, paolo is gonna be in rome this new year, so i'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you wish!

CHANDLER:
 it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. i say this year, no dates, we make a pact. just the six of us- dinner.

 yeah, okay. alright.

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 

 woooo! yeah!

RACHEL:
 phoebe, you're on.

PHOEBE:
 oh, oh, good.

RACHEL:
  demand, miss phoebe buffay. wooh!

PHOEBE:
  to me this time of year.   i made a man with eyes of coal   and a smile so bewitchin',   how was i supposed to know   that my mom was dead in the kitchen?     

PHOEBE:
   ...my mother's ashes   even her eyelashes   are resting in a little yellow jar,   and sometimes when it's breezy...   

PHOEBE:
   ...i feel a little sneezy   and now i-   excuse me, excuse me! yeah, noisy boys!  it something that you would like to share with the entire group?

 no. no, that's- that's okay.

PHOEBE:
 well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing, then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!

CHANDLER:
 

 noth- i was- i was just saying to my-

PHOEBE:
 could you speak up please?

  friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that i'd ever seen in my- in my life. and then he said that- you said you thought

 daryl hannah.

 daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and i said yeah, i liked her in splash, a lot, but not so much in- in wall street, i thought she had kind of a 

 hard quality.

 -hard quality. and uh, while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, we're gonna take a short break. 

JOEY:
 hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! 

ROSS:
 come here, marcel. sit here. 

RACHEL:
 pheebs, i can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. i mean god, by my sixth date with paolo, i mean he had already named both my breasts! ...ooh. did i just share too much?

ROSS:
 just a smidge.

PHOEBE:
 david's like, y'know, scientist guy. he's very methodical.

MONICA:
 i think it's romantic.

PHOEBE:
 me too! oh! did you ever see an officer and a gentleman?

RACHEL:
 yeah!

PHOEBE:
 well, he's kinda like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just- i just wanna be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 

CHANDLER:
 wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to new year's, aren't you. you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact.

PHOEBE:
 no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, 'cause i already asked janice.

MONICA:
 what?!

ROSS:
 c'mon, this was a pact! this was your pact! 

CHANDLER:
 i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped.

MONICA:
 yeah, but janice? that-that was like the worst breakup in history!

CHANDLER:
 i'm not saying it was a good idea, i'm saying i snapped!  

JOEY:
 hi. hi, sorry i'm late. 

CHANDLER:
 too many jokes... must mock joey! 

JOEY:
 nice shoes, huh? 

CHANDLER:
 aah, y'killing me! 

MONICA:
 ross! he's playing with my spatulas again!

ROSS:
 okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

MONICA:
 do you always have to bring him here?

ROSS:
 i didn't wanna leave him alone. alright? we- we had our first fight this morning. i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...

CHANDLER:
 y'know, if you're gonna work late, i could look in on him for you.

ROSS:
 oh, that'd be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.

CHANDLER:
 okay, but if he asks, i'm not going to lie.  

 ...but, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.

PHOEBE:
 okay, alright, i have a question, then. 

 yuh.

PHOEBE:
 um, were you planning on kissing me ever?

 uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. and, uh, the answer would be  that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.

PHOEBE:
 sure.

 right. but, see, the longer i waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where i just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. and, uh, i'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.

PHOEBE:
 oh, david, i, i think you are a sweeping sorta fella. i mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.

 rrrreally.

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah, oh, i'm sure of it. you should just do it, just sweep and throw me. 

 ...now? now?

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, right now.

 okay, okay, okay.   y'know what, this was just really expensive.   and i'll take- this was a gift. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, now you're just kinda tidying. 

 okay, what the hell, what the hell.   you want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?

PHOEBE:
 i can hop.   

ROSS:
 so tell me something. what does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, okay. it's just that chandler has somebody, and phoebe has somebody- i thought i'd ask fun bobby.

CHANDLER:
 fun bobby? your ex-boyfriend fun bobby?

MONICA:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 you know more than one fun bobby?

CHANDLER:
 i happen to know a fun bob.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.

JOEY:
 uh, four.

ROSS:
 four.

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 five. 

RACHEL:
 sorry. paolo's catching an earlier flight.

JOEY:
 yeah, and i met this really hot single mom at the store. what's an elf to do?

ROSS:
 okay, so i'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?

RACHEL:
 oh, c'mon. we'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.

ROSS:
 hey, y'know, this is so not what i needed right now.

MONICA:
 what's the matter?

ROSS:
 oh, it's-it's marcel. he keeps shutting me out, y'know? he's walking around all the time dragging his hands... 

CHANDLER:
 that's so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night.

ROSS:
 really.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, we played, we watched tv.. that juggling thing is amazing.

ROSS:
 what, uh... what juggling thing?

CHANDLER:
 with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that.

ROSS:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. he just balled up socks... and a melon... 

 phoebe. hi. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, hi max! hey, do you know everybody?

 no. have you seen david?

PHOEBE:
 no, no, he hasn't been around.

 well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. we are going to minsk.

PHOEBE:
 minsk?

 minsk. it's in russia.

PHOEBE:
 i know where minsk is.

 we got the grant. three years, all expenses paid.

PHOEBE:
 so when, when do you leave?

 january first. commercial break 

PHOEBE:
 hello?

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hi.

 hi! 

PHOEBE:
 um, well, max told me about minsk, so  congratulations! this is so exciting!

 it'd be even more exciting if we were going.

PHOEBE:
 oh, you're not going? 

 tell her, david. 'i don't wanna go to minsk and work with lifson and yamaguchi and flench, on nonononononono. i wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' 

 thank you, max. thank you.

PHOEBE:
 so-so you're really not going?

 i don't know. i don't know what i'm gonna do. i just- you decide.

PHOEBE:
 oh don't do that.

 please.

PHOEBE:
 oh no no.

 no, but i'm asking-

PHOEBE:
 oh, but i can't do that-

 no, but i can't-

PHOEBE:
 it's your thing, and-

 -make the decision-

PHOEBE:
 okay, um, stay.

 stay.

PHOEBE:
 stay. 

PHOEBE:
 getting so good at that! 

 it was max's stuff.  

 i love this artichoke thing! oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! 

CHANDLER:
 you remember janice.

MONICA:
 vividly. 

MONICA:
 hi.

 hi, i'm sandy.

JOEY:
 sandy! hi! c'mon in!  ...you brought your kids.

 yeah. that's okay, right? 

ROSS:
 par-tay! 

MONICA:
 that thing is not coming in here.

ROSS:
 'that thing'? this is how you greet guests at a party? let me ask you something, if i showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?

MONICA:
 i'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

ROSS:
 okay. he was more embarrassed about that than anyone. okay? and for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...

MONICA:
 alright. just keep him away from me.

ROSS:
 thank you.  little mingling?   

MONICA:
 oh my gosh! rachel, honey.. are you okay? where-where's paolo?

RACHEL:
 rome. jerk missed his flight.

PHOEBE:
 and then... your face is bloated?

RACHEL:
 no. okay. i was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. something about how it was her cab first. and then the next thing i know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! so i'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as i'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. and i hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  

 y'know, when i saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time i ever mentally undressed an elf.

JOEY:
 wow, that's, uh, dirty.

 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 oh yes, yes, yes you can. just say, um, 'phoebe, my work is my life and that's what i have to do right now'. and i say 'your work?! your work?! how can you say that?!'. and then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but i have no choice. can't you understand that?'. and i say 

 uh, ow.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, sorry. um, and, and then you put your arms around me. and then you put your arms around me.  you'll never forget me.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 alrightalrightalright.  closing credits 

ROSS:
  mean i'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.

PHOEBE:
 do you think they have yesterday's daily news?

MONICA:
 why?

PHOEBE:
 just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.

MONICA:
 oh my god.  behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. 

PHOEBE:
 where? 

MONICA:
 he's coming. be cool, be cool, be cool. 

 nice hat.

  

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 i can't believe you did that! opening credits 

MONICA:
 why did i 'woo-hoo'? i mean, what was i hoping would happen? that-that he'd turn round and say 'i love that sound, i must have you now'?

PHOEBE:
 i just wish there was something we could do.   hello. hello, coma guy. get up, you girl scout! up! up! up!

MONICA:
 phoebe, what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 maybe nobody's tried this.

MONICA:
 i wish we at least knew his name... look at that face. i mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. i bet he's a lawyer.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? that means he's artistic.

MONICA:
 okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. and- he can dance!

PHOEBE:
 oh! and, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'yeah, i understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.

MONICA:
 i wish all guys could be like him.

PHOEBE:
 i know.  

CHANDLER:
 are there no conscious men in the city for you two?

MONICA:
 he doesn't have anyone.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.

JOEY:
 i can't believe you said woowoo. i don't even say woowoo.

RACHEL:
 oh, she's coming up! she's coming up! 

 

 the always interesting nora tyler bing. you might wanna put the kids to bed for this one. 

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 chandler, i gotta tell you, i love your mom's books! i love her books! i cannot get on a plane without one! i mean, this is so cool!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'mistress bitch.'

ROSS:
 c'mon, chandler, i love your mom. i think she's a blast.

CHANDLER:
 you can say that because she's not your mom.

ROSS:
 oh, please... 

 bona sera.

RACHEL:
 oh, hi sweetie. 

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

  but i get to see my son, who i love...

CHANDLER:
 this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone.

  mom, somehow.. i don't mean that, i don't mean that bad...

  condoms. 

CHANDLER:
 ...and then he burst into flames.  guy playing in the background.  it starts with monica reading a newspaper to 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

 oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. gimme a hug.  well, i think we're ready for some tequila.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 uh, i'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy. 

RACHEL:
 hi! sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.

ROSS:
 ...but a man can change.   

ROSS:
 anyone want me to appraise anything? 

RACHEL:
 mrs. bing, i have to tell you, i've read everything you've ever written. no, i mean it! i mean, when i read euphoria at midnight, all i wanted to do was become a writer.

 oh, please, honey, listen, if i can do it, anybody can. you just start with half a dozen european cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! you have got yourself a book.

CHANDLER:
 myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen. 

 yeah, any messages for room 226? 

 you okay there, slugger?

ROSS:
 yeah, i'm fine, i'm fine.

ROSS:
 nothing. nothing nothing nothing.

  isn't it.

ROSS:
 no. it's the one he's licking.

 she's supposed to be with you.

ROSS:
 you're good.

 oh, ross, listen to me. i have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?

ROSS:
 the girl on the cover with her nipples showing?

 no. because i know how to write men that women fall in love with. believe me, i cannot sell a paolo. people will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a paolo. c'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.

ROSS:
 when?

 he's not a hero. ...you know who our hero is.

ROSS:
 the guy on the cover with his nipples showing?

 no, it's you!

ROSS:
 please.

 no, really, c'mon. you're smart, you're sexy...

ROSS:
 right.

 you are gonna be fine, believe me. 

ROSS:
 uh-oh...  

JOEY:
 uhhhh.... i'll just pee in the street. commercial break  

ROSS:
 hey, is chandler here?

JOEY:
 yeah. 

ROSS:
 okay, uh, about last night, um, chandler.. you didn't tell...   okay, 'cause i'm thinking- we don't need to tell chandler, i mean, it was just a kiss, right? one kiss? no big deal? right?

JOEY:
 right. no big deal.

ROSS:
 okay. 

JOEY:
 in bizarro world!! you broke the code!

ROSS:
 what code?

JOEY:
 you don't kiss your friend's mom! sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom! 

CHANDLER:
 what are you guys doing out here?

ROSS:
 uh.. uh.. well, joey and i had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. but, um, apparently, somebody overslept.

JOEY:
 yeah, well, you don't have your racket.

ROSS:
 no, no i don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.

JOEY:
 yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.

CHANDLER:
 okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.  

ROSS:
 okay, i'm scum, i'm scum.

JOEY:
 ross, how could you let this happen?

ROSS:
 i don't know, god, i... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? she's, she's sexy, she's...

JOEY:
 you don't think my mom's sexy?

ROSS:
 well... not in the same way...

JOEY:
 i'll have you know that gloria tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? you think it's easy giving birth to seven children?

ROSS:
 okay, i think we're getting into a weird area here... 

RACHEL:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 well, not playing raquetball!

JOEY:
 he forgot to leave his grip size!

ROSS:
 he didn't get the goggles!

RACHEL:
 well,sounds like you two have issues. 

RACHEL:
 goodbye, baby.

 ciao, bela. 

ROSS:
 do they wait for me to do this? 

JOEY:
 so are you gonna tell him?

ROSS:
 why would i tell him?

JOEY:
 how about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.

ROSS:
 oh...

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!

MONICA:
 ...what did i ask?  

MONICA:
 hi.

PHOEBE:
 hi.

MONICA:
 what are you doing here?

PHOEBE:
 nothing, i just thought i'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that i.. y'know, so what are you doing here?

MONICA:
 i'm not really here. just thought i'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... do you come here a lot? without me?

PHOEBE:
 no.  ...so, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?

MONICA:
 how would i know? i-i wasn't here.

PHOEBE:
 really? not even to, um, change his pajamas?!    

CHANDLER:
 oh my god. 

ROSS:
 you're my friend. i-i had to tell you.

CHANDLER:
 i can't believe it. paolo kissed my mom?

ROSS:
 yeah, um, i don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  can't do this, i did it, it was me, i'm sorry, i kissed your mom.

CHANDLER:
 what?

ROSS:
 i was really upset about rachel and paolo, and i think i had too much tequila, and nora- um, mrs. mom- your bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- but nothing happened, nothing- ask joey, joey, uh, came in-

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

CHANDLER:
 i spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!

JOEY:
 hey, hey, hey, you're lucky i caught them when i did, or else who knows what woulda happened.

ROSS:
 thanks, man, big help.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 i wasn't- i mean, i-

CHANDLER:
 y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you. 

ROSS:
 i know-

CHANDLER:
 i can't believe you did this. 

ROSS:
 chandler-

JOEY:
 me neither, y'know what-

CHANDLER:
 i'm still mad at you for not telling me.

JOEY:
 what are you mad at me for?!

ROSS:
 chandler-

CHANDLER:
 you gotta let me slam the door! 

JOEY:
  what happens when you break the code?

ROSS:
 joey-

JOEY:
 ah!   

MONICA:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hey.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah. thought i'd give it a shot. i'm still on the first chapter. now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hello.

MONICA:
 hello. 

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 no, you?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 okay, maybe it was a trick question.  we do this now?

RACHEL:
 okay. 

JOEY:
  their wedding day. now you tell me she's not a knockout.

ROSS:
 i cannot believe we're having this conversation.

JOEY:
 c'mon! just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 thanks. hi, um, 'kay. i'd like to start with a song that's about a man that i recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.  'kay.   you don't have to be awake to be my man,   as long as you have brainwaves i'll be there to hold your hand.   though we just met the other day,    there's something i have got to say...    short break! 

RACHEL:
  

CHANDLER:
 what was that?

ROSS:
 oh, uh, phoebe just started a...

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i believe i was talking to joey, alright there, mother-kisser? 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 chandler, can i just say something? i-i know you're still mad at me, i just wanna say that there were two people there that night. okay? two sets of lips.

CHANDLER:
 yes, well, i expect this from her. okay? she's always been a freudian nightmare. 

ROSS:
 okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?

CHANDLER:
 because it's complicated, it's complex- hey, you kissed my mom! 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 that's very funny. we done now?

ROSS:
 no! okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?

CHANDLER:
 that would be no. look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. alright? trust me, you can't talk to her.

ROSS:
 okay, 'you' can't, or   okay, that's my finger.  that's, that's my knee.   

PHOEBE:
 alright, whadyou do with him? 

MONICA:
 oh! you're awake!

PHOEBE:
 look at you! how, how do you feel?

 uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.

MONICA:
 you look good!

 i feel good! ...who are you?

MONICA:
 oh, sorry.

PHOEBE:
 i'm phoebe buffay.

MONICA:
 i'm monica geller. i've been taking care of you.

PHOEBE:
 well, we both have.

 so, the etch-a-sketch is from you guys?

PHOEBE:
 well, actually it's just from me.

MONICA:
 i got you the foot massager.

PHOEBE:
 you know who shaved you? that was me.

MONICA:
 i read to you.

PHOEBE:
 i sang. 

 well,... thanks.

MONICA:
 oh, my pleasure.

PHOEBE:
 you're welcome.

 so. i guess i'll see you around.

PHOEBE:
 what, that's it? 

MONICA:
 "see you around?"

 well, what do you want me to say?

MONICA:
 oh, i don't know. maybe, um, "that was nice?" admit something to me? "i'll call you?" 

 alright, i'll call you.

PHOEBE:
 i don't think you mean that.

MONICA:
 this is so typical. y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. and then- we just get nothing back! and then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "see you around!" let's go, phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 y'know what? we thought you were different. but i guess it was just the coma. 

 car's waiting downstairs, i just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. anything you want from lisbon?

CHANDLER:
 no, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.

 alright, well, be good, i love you. 

CHANDLER:
 you kissed my best ross! ...or something to that effect.

 

CHANDLER:
 really stupid.

 really stupid. and i don't even know how it happened. i'm sorry, honey, i promise it will never happen again. are we okay now?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. no. no...  

ROSS:
 ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.

JOEY:
 shh. he did it. he told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.

ROSS:
 you're kidding.

JOEY:
 no, no. he said "when are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"

ROSS:
 wow!

JOEY:
 then she came back with "the question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise i have a bomb?"

ROSS:
 'kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "when are you gonna grow up and realise i am your mom?"

JOEY:
 that makes more sense.

ROSS:
 so, what's going on now?

JOEY:
 i dunno, i've been standing here spelling it out for you!   i don't hear anything. oh, wait, wait, wait. 

ROSS:
 whaddya see?

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 okay. now this is just the first chapter, and i want your absolute honest opinion. oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.

MONICA:
 what's a 'niffle'?

JOEY:
 you usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.

RACHEL:
 alright, alright, so i'm not a great typist...

ROSS:
 wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!

RACHEL:
 alright, that's it! give it back! that's it!

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no, we're done. opening credits 

MONICA:
 aunt syl, stop yelling! all i'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, i would have made vegetarian lasagna.   well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape. 

JOEY:
 ross, did you really read all these baby books?

ROSS:
 yup! you could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and i can find my way out of there like that! 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. 

CHANDLER:
 and, we're done with the yogurt. 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 aunt syl, i did this as a favor, i am not a caterer. what do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  syl.  

JOEY:
 hey ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?   hi daddy! 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 i know... 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? shouldn't it be...  flung by now? 

RACHEL:
 i mean, we are way past the fling thing, i mean, i am feeling things that i've only read about in danielle steele books, you know? i mean, when i'm with him, i'm totally, totally... 

ROSS:
 ...nauseous, i'm physically nauseous. what am i supposed to do, huh? call immigration?  

JOEY:
 i love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 oh, that's great, that is great!  

ROSS:
 hey, when did you and susan meet huey lewis?

 uh, that's our friend tanya.

ROSS:
  tanya.

ROSS:
  trouble with the image of you and susan together, when you throw in tanya  , yaw...

 the sex of the baby, ross.

ROSS:
 oh, you know the sex of the baby? oh, oh-oh-oh!

 do you want to know?

ROSS:
 no, no, no, no, no, i don't want to know, absolutely not. i think, you know, i think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  

 oh, hello ross!

ROSS:
 susan...

 so, so, did you hear?

ROSS:
 yes, we did, everything's a-ok!

 oh, that's so...  really is...do we know...?

ROSS:
  who doesn't want to know, standing right here!

 mm-hmmm  

ROSS:
 ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?

ROSS:

ROSS:

 hello?

ROSS:
    

CHANDLER:
 ok, so it's just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one?

JOEY:
 that's the rule.

CHANDLER:
 what rule? there's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!

JOEY:
 how'd you get to that?

CHANDLER:
 well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio

JOEY:
 you knew about that?

CHANDLER:
 well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.

JOEY:
 ok, ok, how about if we split it?

CHANDLER:
 what do you mean, like, buy it together?

JOEY:
 yeah

CHANDLER:
 you think we're ready for something like that?

JOEY:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 well, it's a pretty big commitment, i mean, what if one of us wants to move out?

JOEY:
 why, are you moving out?

CHANDLER:
 i'm not moving out. 

JOEY:
 you'd tell me if you were moving out right

CHANDLER:
 yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate kip...

JOEY:
 aw, i know all about kip!

CHANDLER:
 it's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.

JOEY:
 well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me?

CHANDLER:
 aw, don't do that  

 we've got a couple changes in your schedule. your

00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and miss somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

PHOEBE:
 ok, thanks. 

 oh, here comes your 3:00. i don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum 

 buon giorno, bella phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 oh, paolo, hi, what are you doing here?

 uh, racquela tell me you massage, eh?

PHOEBE:
 well, racquela's right, yeah! 

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay, i don't know what you just said, so let's get started.

 uh, i am, uh, being naked?

PHOEBE:
 um, that's really your decision, i mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! you're being naked! 

RACHEL:
  couldn't not know, i mean, if, if the doctor knows, and carol knows, and susan knows.... 

MONICA:
 and monica knows...

ROSS:
 wha, heh, how could you know, i don't even know!

MONICA:
 carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, i asked, she told me.

JOEY:
 so what's it gonna be?  

ROSS:
 waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and i don't know!

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, i'm just excited about being an aunt!

JOEY:
 or an uncle...  

 hey phoebe!

ROSS:
 hi pheebs!

RACHEL:
 pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 fine!

MONICA:
 phoebe, what's the matter?

PHOEBE:
 nothing, i'm sorry, i'm just, i'm out of sorts.

 hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?

RACHEL:
 oh, right, that's me!

JOEY:
 hey, chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.

CHANDLER:
 fine. 

MONICA:
 phoebe, what is it?

PHOEBE:
 all right, you know paolo?

ROSS:
 i'm familiar with his work, yes...

PHOEBE:
 well, he made a move on me. 

JOEY:
 whoa, store will be open tomorrow!

CHANDLER:
 more coffee over here, please! commercial break 

MONICA:
 well, what happened?

PHOEBE:
 well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.  

  ooooohh!

ROSS:
 my god.

MONICA:
 are you sure?  

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, i'm sure.  and all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.  

MONICA:
 was it...?

PHOEBE:
 oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.

 oooooo.... 

RACHEL:
 "ooo," what?

PHOEBE:
 uma thurman.

MONICA:
 oh!

ROSS:
 the actress! 

ROSS:
 thanks rach. 

CHANDLER:
 so what are you gonna do?

ROSS:
 you have to tell her! you have to tell her! it's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, i think it's a feminist issue! guys? guys?  

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah, you have to tell her.

JOEY:
 feminist issue. that's where i went!

PHOEBE:
 she is gonna hate me.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 will you pick one, just pick one! here, how about that one?  

CHANDLER:
 that's patio furniture!

JOEY:
 so what, like people are gonna come in and think, "uh-oh, i'm outside again?" of course!

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 i don't know, birds just don't say, "hello, sit here, eat something."

CHANDLER:
 you pick one.

JOEY:
 all right, how about the ladybugs?

CHANDLER:
 oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!

JOEY:
 fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!

CHANDLER:
 not like that, i won't!    

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 are you moving out?

RACHEL:
 no, these aren't all my suitcases.   this one's paolo's.

PHOEBE:
 um, um, rachel can we talk for a sec?

RACHEL:
 well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause paolo's on his way over.

PHOEBE:
 oh! 

RACHEL:
 oh, pheebs, pheebs...

PHOEBE:
 ok, um,  time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. one, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, i never lie, and three, i make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. 

RACHEL:
   oh my god, why have i never tasted these before?!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i don't make them a lot because i don't think it's fair to the other cookies

RACHEL:
 all right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies i've ever had.

PHOEBE:
 which proves that i never lie.

RACHEL:
 i guess you don't.

PHOEBE:
 paolo made a pass at me.   

CHANDLER:
 so, what do you think?

ROSS:
 i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen.

CHANDLER:
 i know! 

MONICA:
 so how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?

JOEY:
 who cares, we'll eat at the sink! come on, let's play!

MONICA:
 heads up ross!   you suck!  

PHOEBE:
 are you okay?

RACHEL:
 i need some milk.

PHOEBE:
 ok, i've got milk  here you go... 

RACHEL:
 no...oh, i feel so stupid! oh, i think about the other day with you guys and i was all "oh, paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." oh, god, i'm so embarrassed!

PHOEBE:
 i'm so embarrassed, i'm the one he hit on! 

RACHEL:
 pheebs, if i had never met him this never would have happened!

 i'm so sorry! no i'm sorry! no i'm sorry! no i'm sorry! 

PHOEBE:
 no, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?

RACHEL:
 i don't know...right, he's the pig!

PHOEBE:
 such a pig!

RACHEL:
 oh, god, he's such a pig, 

PHOEBE:
 oh he's like a...

RACHEL:
 he's like a big disgusting... 

PHOEBE:
 ...like a...

RACHEL:
 ...pig...pig man!

PHOEBE:
 yes, good! ok...

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
  gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...

RACHEL:
 ok, ok, pheebs...

PHOEBE:
 the end.

RACHEL:
 oh, god...

PHOEBE:
 should i not have told you?

RACHEL:
 no, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that i know. uh, i just liked it better before it was better...   

PHOEBE:
 i think she took it pretty well. you know paolo's over there right now, so...

MONICA:
 we should get over there and see if she's okay.   just one...second! score!  come on. 

ROSS:
  butts.

JOEY:
 no-no, she kicked our butts. you could be on the olympic standing-there team.

ROSS:
 come on, two on one.

CHANDLER:
 what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!

ROSS:
 what, now?

JOEY:
 yes, now is when you swoop! you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she's gotta know that you're everything he's not! you're like, like the anti-paolo!

CHANDLER:
 my catholic friend is right. she's distraught. you're there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross!   

 no, that's cold, that's cold, that's... 

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 don't stare. now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving,  , ok, that is either, "how could you?" or, "enormous breasts!" here he comes! 

PHOEBE:
 ooh! 

 uh, i am, uh, to say good-bye.

PHOEBE:
 oh, ok bye-bye.

MONICA:
 paolo, i really hate you for what you did to rachel,   but i still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.

 grazie.

ROSS:
 paolo, i-i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say... 

PHOEBE:
 oh, just look at her... 

ROSS:
 oh you guys, i-i really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...

MONICA:
 oh, you're right.

ROSS:
  

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hey.

ROSS:
 you all right?

RACHEL:
 ooh, i've been better...

ROSS:
 come here.  him...you know, i mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.

RACHEL:
 oh, ross...

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 i am so sick of guys. i don't want to look at another guy, i don't want to think about another guy, i don't even want to be near another guy. 

ROSS:
 huh.

RACHEL:
 oh ross, you're so great!

ROSS:
 ohhhh  

MONICA:
 ooh...hey honey, are you all right?

RACHEL:
 oh...

PHOEBE:
 you ok?

RACHEL:
 ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?

PHOEBE:
 yep!

ROSS:
 see, rach, uh, see, i don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. i really don't. i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.

RACHEL:
 no. i just need to be by myself for a while, you know? i just got to figure out what i want

ROSS:
 uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a paolo.

RACHEL:
 no, i know, i know, and i'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 what?

ROSS:
 i-i'm, i'm having a boy?

RACHEL:
 uh...no. no, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.

ROSS:
 wha-i'm having, i'm having a boy! 

 yes, you're having a boy! 

ROSS:
 i'm having a boy! oh, i'm having a boy! 

CHANDLER:
 wha-

JOEY:
 wha-

 what is it?

ROSS:
 i'm having a boy! i-i'm having a boy!

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

 we already knew that! 

ROSS:
 i'm having a son. um...  closing credits 

MONICA:
 yes! and that would be a shut-down!

 shut-out!!  

MONICA:
 where are you guys going? come on, one more game!

JOEY:
 uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, get out!

MONICA:
 you guys are always hanging out in my apartment! come on, i'll only use my left hand, huh? come on, wussies!  gotta go. i'm going, 

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 that is it! you just barge in here, you don't knock

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry!

RACHEL:
 you have no respect for anybody's privacy!

CHANDLER:
 rachel, wait, wait.

RACHEL:
 no, you wait! this is ridiculous!

CHANDLER:
 can i just say one thing?

RACHEL:
 what? what?!

CHANDLER:
 that's a relatively open weave and i can still see your... nipular areas.

RACHEL:
 oh!!  opening credits  

PHOEBE:
 oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. y'know? like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.

 that's pretty much it.

PHOEBE:
 oops!

 but you tell it really well, sweetie.

PHOEBE:
 thanks. okay, now go away so we can talk about you.

 okay. i'll miss you.

PHOEBE:
 isn't he great?

RACHEL:
 he's so cute! and he seems to like you so much.

PHOEBE:
 i know, i know. so sweet... and so complicated. and for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?

MONICA:
 so, you think you'll do it on his couch?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i don't know, i don't know. i think that's a little weird, y'know? vinyl.

RACHEL:
 okaaay. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, yes, could i have one of those. 

RACHEL:
 no, i'm sorry, we're all out of those. anybody else?

CHANDLER:
 okay.

 did i, uh, did i miss something?

CHANDLER:
 no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies.

ROSS:
 you what? wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?

CHANDLER:
 it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.

RACHEL:
 okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.

RACHEL:
 okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change.

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.

RACHEL:
 nice? they were nice. i mean, that's it? i mean, mittens are nice.

CHANDLER:
 okaaay, 

 you're so funny! he's really funny! i wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.

CHANDLER:
 whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what'd you mean by that?

 oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.

CHANDLER:
 huh.

 i mean hey! i just met you, i don't know you from adam. ...only child, right? parents divorced before you hit puberty.

CHANDLER:
 uhhuh, how did you know that?

 it's textbook. 

JOEY:
 hey you guys. hey, you all know my dad, right?

 hey! hey, mr. trib!

MONICA:
 hey, how long are you in the city?

 just for a coupla days. i got a job midtown. i figure i'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  don't know this one.

PHOEBE:
 oh, this is my friend roger.

 hi. 

 hey, hey. good to meet you, roger.

 you too, sir.

 

JOEY:
 dad, dad. 

 oh, 'scuse me. so ross, uh, how's the wife?   off there too, uh? uh, chandler, quick, say something funny!  

 gotta go. i miss you too, i love you, but it's getting real late now

JOEY:
  bazida, and... excuse me?  

 her name's ronni. she's a pet mortician. 

JOEY:
 sure. so how long you been... 

 remember when you were a little kid, i used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?

JOEY:
 since then?!

 no, it's only been six years. i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that i wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...joe. y'ever been in love?

JOEY:
 ...i d'know.

 then y'haven't. you're burning your tomatoes.

JOEY:
 you're one to talk. 

 joe, your dad's in love big time. and the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.

JOEY:
 oh man. please tell me one of 'em is ma.

 of course, course one of 'em's ma. what's the matter with you. 

JOEY:
 it's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. he's like actually some spy, working for the c.i.a.  cool.... this blows!

RACHEL:
 i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents?   why do they have to become people? why do they have... 

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 did you not get a good enough look the other day?

ROSS:
 alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i don't see that happening?

RACHEL:
 c'mon, he's right. tit for tat.

CHANDLER:
 well i'm not showing you my 'tat.' 

MONICA:
 hello?

PHOEBE:
 

 

MONICA:
 c'mon up.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 what's the matter with rog?

ROSS:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... i hate that guy.

ROSS:
 what, so he was a little analytical. that's what he does, y'know? c'mon, he's not that bad. 

ROSS:
 y'see, that's where you're wrong. why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?

 i dunno. maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.

ROSS:
 why? why would i why? why? why? why?

 i don't know. maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...

MONICA:
 wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.

 well, i don't know. i mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.

ROSS:
 that that's ridiculous! i don't feel guilty for her failures!

MONICA:
 oh! so you think i'm a failure!

PHOEBE:
 isn't he good?

ROSS:
 nonono, thatthat's not what i was saying...

MONICA:
 y'know, all these years, i thought you were on my side. but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they'd keep liking you better!

ROSS:
 hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good! 

RACHEL:
 you're right! i mean you're right! it wasn't just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles' cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in. 

 that's tough. tough stuff. c'mon, pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay. feel better, rachel, 'kay?

 geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay. listen, thanks for everything, mon.

MONICA:
 you're welcome.

 listen guys, it was great seeing you again. mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? remember, they're just food, they're not love. 

MONICA:
 hate that guy!  

JOEY:
 night, you guys. 

CHANDLER:
 oh look, it's the woman we ordered.

JOEY:
 hey. can, uh, can we help you?

 oh, no thanks, i'm just waiting for, uh, joey tribbiani.

JOEY:
 i'm joey tribbiani.

 oh no, not you, big joey. oh my god, you're so much cuter than your pictures! 

CHANDLER:
 uh, joey's having an embolism, but i'd go for a nip, y'know? commercial break 

 now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. like, chasing their tail, 

CHANDLER:
 joey, if i go first, i wanna be looking for my keys.

 that's a good one! 

 hey, joe.

JOEY:
 dad, ronni's here.

 huh?

 hi.

 hey! hello, babe! wh what're what're you doing here?

 oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, i figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. 

 thank you. uh...

CHANDLER:
 so, who's up for a big game of kerplunk?

 look, i uh, i shouldn'ta come. i-i'd better get going, i don't wanna miss the last train.

 i don't want you taking that thing.

 oh, where'm i gonna stay, here?

JOEY:
 who-ah-ho.

 we'll go to a hotel.

 

JOEY:
 no you won't.

 no we won't.

JOEY:
 if you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. i want you right here where i can keep an eye on you.

 you're gonna keep an eye on us?

JOEY:
 that's right, mister, and i don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.

 wow. he's strict.

JOEY:
 now dad, you'll be in my room, ronni uh, you can stay in chandler's room.

 thanks. you're, uh, you're a good kid.

CHANDLER:
 c'mon, i'll show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it's not followed by "no thanks, it's late." 

JOEY:
 okay. now this is just for tonight. starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. this has gone on long enough.

 what kinda change?

JOEY:
 well, either you break it off with ronni

 i can't do that!

JOEY:
 then you gotta come clean with ma! this is not right!

 yeah, but this is

JOEY:
 i don't wanna hear it! now go to my room!  

CHANDLER:
 hey, kicky. what're you doing?

JOEY:
 just trying to get comfortable. i can't sleep in my underwear. 

CHANDLER:
 well, you're gonna.

JOEY:
 i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls...

CHANDLER:
 are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?

JOEY:
 y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women. and i always figured, when the right one comes along, i'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? now i'm looking at my dad, thinking...

CHANDLER:
 hey, you're not him. you're you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?

JOEY:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 no. you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. now that wasn't easy, but you did it! and i'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "no thanks, i'm married."

JOEY:
 you really think so?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. i really do.

JOEY:
 thanks, chandler. 

CHANDLER:
 get off! 

 hi.

MONICA:
 hi...may i help you?

 yeah, uh, joey said i could use your shower, since, uh, chandler's in ours?

MONICA:
 okay...who are you?

 oh, i'm ronni. ronni rappelano? the mistress?

MONICA:
 oh, c'mon in.

 thanks.

RACHEL:
 hi, i'm rachel.

 hi.

RACHEL:
 bathroom's up there.

 great.

RACHEL:
 hey, listen, ronni, how long would you say chandler's been in the shower?

 oh, like, uh, five minutes?

RACHEL:
 perfect. fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.   hey, mr. trib. 

 hey. morning, dear. 

RACHEL:
 chandler bing? it's time to see your thing. 

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 i thought it was chandler!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing!

CHANDLER:
 sorry, my my thing was in there with me. 

 hey, pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 hey. 

MONICA:
 how's it going?

PHOEBE:
 good. oh oh! roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys. 

PHOEBE:
 so what's going on?

MONICA:
 nothing, um, it's just, um... it's roger. 

ROSS:
 i dunno, there's just something about...

CHANDLER:
 basically we just feel that he's...

RACHEL:
 we hate that guy.

 yeah. hate him.

ROSS:
 we're sorry, pheebs, we're sorry.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. okay. okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?

 ...no, we hate him.

RACHEL:
 we're sorry.  

JOEY:
 ma! what're you doing here?

 i came to give you this  

JOEY:
 oww! big ring!

 why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? things were fine the way they were! there's chicken in there, put it away. for god's sake, joey, really.  

JOEY:
 hold on, you-you knew?

 of course i knew! what did you think? your father is no james bond. you should've heard some of his cover stories. "i'm sleeping over at my accountant's," i mean, what is that? please!

JOEY:
 so then how could you i mean, how could you?!

 do you remember how your father used to be? always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. now he's happy! i mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.

JOEY:
 ma, i don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! i mean, what about you?

 me? i'm fine. look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like sting. and i'll tell you something else. ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... i mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.

JOEY:
 i'm...happy...for you?

 well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. i just want it the way it was.

JOEY:
 ma, i'm sorry. i just did what i thought you'd want.

 i know you did, cookie. oh, i know you did. so tell me. did you see her?

JOEY:
 yeah. you're ten times prettier than she is.

 that's sweet. could i take her?

JOEY:
 with this ring?  

 what's wrong, sweetie?

PHOEBE:
 nothing, nothing.

 aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.  

PHOEBE:
 it's, i mean, it's nothing, i'm fine. it's my friends. they-they have a liking problem with you. in that, um, they don't.

 oh. they don't.

PHOEBE:
 but they don't see all the wonderfulness that i see. they don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. they just think you're a little...

 what?

PHOEBE:
 intense and creepy. 

 oh.

PHOEBE:
 but i don't. me, phoebe.

 well, i'm not i'm not at all surprised they feel that way.

PHOEBE:
 you're not? see, that's why you're so great! 

 actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, i'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'oh, define me! define me! love me, i need love!'. 

MONICA:
 so you talked to your dad, huh.

JOEY:
 yeah. he's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today.

RACHEL:
 wow.

CHANDLER:
 things sure have changed here on waltons mountain.

ROSS:
 so joey, you okay?

JOEY:
 yeah, i guess. it's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.

RACHEL:
 just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.

CHANDLER:
 if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... i'll end up like my mom.

PHOEBE:
 

 hey, pheebs.

MONICA:
 how's it going?

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay, except i broke up with roger.

 awww.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, right.

 aaawwwwww!!

RACHEL:
 what happened?

PHOEBE:
 i don't know, i mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways i think he is so right for me, it's just... i hate that guy! closing credits 

PHOEBE:
 hey, joey. what's going on?

JOEY:
 clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. next stop: rachel green.  

MONICA:
 joey!! what the hell were you doing?!

JOEY:
 sorry. wrong boobies.  

MONICA:
 hello, joey. 

JOEY:
 i'm tellin' you ross, she wants you.

ROSS:
 she barely knows me. we just live in the same building.

CHANDLER:
 any contact?

ROSS:
 she lent me an egg once.

JOEY:
 you're in!

ROSS:
 aw, right.

 hi, ross.

ROSS:
 hey. 

CHANDLER:
 come on, ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbiani don't think we need a third... 

JOEY:
 excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? thanks.

ROSS:
 an egg?

JOEY:
 yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "here's your egg back, i'm returning your egg."

CHANDLER:
 i think it's winning.

ROSS:
 i think it's insane.

CHANDLER:
 she'll love it. go with the egg, my friend. 

JOEY:
 think it'll work?

CHANDLER:
 no, it's suicide. the man's got an egg. opening credits  

MONICA:
 you can not do this.

RACHEL:
 do what, do what?

MONICA:
 roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.

RACHEL:
 no! phoebes! don't you remember why you dumped the guy?

PHOEBE:
 'cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on valentine's day!

MONICA:
 but phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. i know i do. 

RACHEL:
 well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?

JOEY:
 actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.

CHANDLER:
 oh, uh, listen, about tonight...

JOEY:
 no, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. the only reason she's goin' out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend.

CHANDLER:
 yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a...

JOEY:
 pathetic mess? i know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. i'm thinkin', cha-ching!   thanks. look, you have not been out with a woman since janice. you're doin' this.

ROSS:
 hi. she said yes.

CHANDLER:
 yes! way to go, man!   still got the egg, huh? 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh, uh, i... don't... care.  no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess.

 hi, joey. well well, look what you brought. very nice.

CHANDLER:
 ...and what did you bring?

 she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for janice.

CHANDLER:
 janice?  

 oh.... my.... god.

CHANDLER:
  

CHANDLER:
 ok, i'm makin' a break for it, i'm goin' out the window. 

JOEY:
 no, no, no, don't! i've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine. just calm down. 

CHANDLER:
 calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that i've dumped twice in the last five months!

JOEY:
  can't go when i'm nervous.

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're right.   come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!  

RACHEL:
 ok, ok, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney.

MONICA:
 which one was pete carney?

RACHEL:
 pete the weeper? remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. 

MONICA:
 yeah, well, i'll take a little crying any day over howard-the-"i-win"-guy.  the guy for two monthsi didn't get to win once.

RACHEL:
 how did we end up with these jerks? we're good people!

MONICA:
 i don't know. maybe we're some kinda magnets.

PHOEBE:
 i know i am. that's why i can't wear a digital watch.

MONICA:
 there's more beer, right?

PHOEBE:
 oh! you know my friend abby who shaves her head? she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.

RACHEL:
 pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. so, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. it's valentine's day. it's perfect.

MONICA:
 ok, well, what kind of ritual?

PHOEBE:
 ok. we can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.

RACHEL:
 or?

PHOEBE:
 or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.

MONICA:
 burning's good.

RACHEL:
 burning's good. yeah, i got stuff to burn.  lorraine are seated very close, chandler and janice have backed their chairs away from one 

 you know, ever since i was little, i've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.

JOEY:
 good for you. 

 by the way, chandler. i cut you out of all my pictures. so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads.

CHANDLER:
 that's ok.

 oh, are you sure? really? because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 uh, can i talk to you for a second, over there? 

JOEY:
 uh, we might be leaving now.

CHANDLER:
 tell me it's "you and me" we.

JOEY:
 she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. i'm not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it.

CHANDLER:
 ok, you can not do this to me.

JOEY:
 you're right, i'm sorry. you're right.

 

JOEY:
 i'm outta here. here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler.

CHANDLER:
 i hope she throws up on you. 

CHANDLER:
 so...

 just us.

CHANDLER:
 oh, what a crappy night!

 although, i have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. 

CHANDLER:
 excuse me.   how ya doin'?

 so, do we have the best friends or what?

CHANDLER:
 joey's not a friend. he's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert? a big screen tv?

 i will go for that drink.

CHANDLER:
 you got it. good woman!  get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?

 each.

CHANDLER:
 that's right, each. oh, and a uh rob roy.  wanted to know...  

 happy valentine's day! commercial break 

 oh, i miss you already. can you believe this happened?

CHANDLER:
 no... no! and yet it did. good-bye, janice.

 kiss me! 

MONICA:
 oh, chandler, sorry. 

MONICA:
 ohhh, chandler, sorry! hey, janice.

 hi, monica.

CHANDLER:
 ok, well, this was very special.

MONICA:
 rach, come see who's out here! 

RACHEL:
 oh my god. janice, hi!

CHANDLER:
 janice is gonna go away now.

MONICA:
 i'll be right back. 

RACHEL:
 oh, joey, look who it is.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh, good, joey's home now.

 this is so fun. this is like a reunion in the hall. 

MONICA:
 oh, hi, ross. yeah. there's someone i want you to say hi to.   he just happened to call.

 hi, ross. yes, it's me. how did you know?  

ROSS:
 i'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from new york to los angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.  

 that's funny. who are they?

ROSS:
 the blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.

 you mean they're lovers.

ROSS:
 if you wanna put a label on it.

 wow, uh, anything else i should know?

ROSS:
 nope, nope, that's it.  

ROSS:
 oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. i always forget that part.   helloo! 

PHOEBE:
 ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.

MONICA:
 all i have is, is oregano and a fresca.

PHOEBE:
 um, that's ok!  of a righteous man.

RACHEL:
 ok, pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.

MONICA:
 can we just start throwing things in?

PHOEBE:
 ok, yeah, ok. 

RACHEL:
  shorts.

PHOEBE:
 ok, and i have the, uh receipt for my dinner with nokululu oon ah ah.

MONICA:
 look, here's a picture of scotty jared naked.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 no.

 eww!

RACHEL:
 and here we have the last of paulo's grappa.

MONICA:
 hey, rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...   

CHANDLER:
 how can i dump this woman on valentine's day?

JOEY:
 i don't know. you dumped her on new year's.

CHANDLER:
 oh, man. in my next life, i'm coming back as a toilet brush. 

 hello, funny valentine.

CHANDLER:
 hi, just janice.

 hello, joey, our little matchmaker. i could just kiss you all over, and i'm gonna! 

JOEY:
  

ROSS:
 so, um, what do you do for a living?

 well, um, for the past few years i've been working.. carol and susan, not listening to kristin. susan gets up, and has to go. carol is left ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.

 oh no. i thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 

 i thought they could...i'll try to get back as soon as i can. i'm sorry. 

ROSS:
 now that is funny. hey, do you think...would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us? 'cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. 

 

ROSS:
 are you sure? great. carol? wanna come over and join us?

 oh, no no no. i'm fine. i'm fine.

ROSS:
 come on. these people'll scooch down. you guys'll scooch, won't you? let's try scooching! come on. come on. uh, kristen riggs, this is carol willick. carol, kristin. uh, carol teaches sixth grade. and, kristin, kristin... funnily enough, wasn't even her major!  

 what do we got there?

 a piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picturewow, that guy's hairier than the chief!

MONICA:
 you know, it's a really funny story how this happened.

 it's all right. it's all right. you don't have to explain. this isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.

 you're our third call tonight.

RACHEL:
 really?

 oh, sure, valentine's is our busiest night of the year. 

 i brought you something.

CHANDLER:
 is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts.  jan forever.

 i had them made special.

CHANDLER:
 ok, janice. janice. hey, janice. look, there's no way for me to tell you this. at least there's no new way for me to tell you this. i just don't things are gonna work out.

 that's fine.

CHANDLER:
 

 mmm-hmm. because i know that this isn't the end.

CHANDLER:
 oh no, you see, actually it is.

 no, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. don't you know it yet? you love me, chandler bing.

CHANDLER:
 oh, no i don't.

 well then ask yourself this. why do you think we keep ending up together? new year's? who invited who? valentine's? who asked who into whose bed? 

CHANDLER:
 i did, but...

 you seek me out. something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. janice, janice. you want me. you need me. you can't live without me. and you know it. you just don't know you know it. see ya. 

CHANDLER:
 call me! 

 it's not true. i never called your mother a wolverine.

ROSS:
 you did so. i swear, i swear has she been in the bathroom?

 uh, i don't think she's in the bathroom. her coat is gone.

ROSS:
 well maybe it's cold in there. or maybe i screwed up the first date i had in 9 years. 

 that could be it.

ROSS:
 oh, god.  pretty hot.  

 mushroom. smile. they won't all be like this. some women might even stay through dinner. sorry, that's not funny

ROSS:
 no, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. well, do i have to? i mean, i'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. and um, and then i'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and i don't, i don't have to...you know, here's a wacky thought. um, what's say you and i give it another shot? no no no, i know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. but what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? let's just stick a pin in it, ok? because, we're great together, you know. you can't deny it. besides, you're carrying my baby. i mean, how perfect is that? but see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. i love you. 

 oh, i love you too. but...

ROSS:
 no but, no but.

 you know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? it's time to take the pin out. you'll find someone, i know you will. the right woman is just waiting for you.

ROSS:
 that's easy for you to say, you found one already.

 all you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set. 

 not her. closing credits 

 we get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?

RACHEL:
 so, um, will you bring the truck?

 i'll even let you ring the bell.

RACHEL:
 oh, my god.

PHOEBE:
 see, there you go, the cleansing works!

MONICA:
 they're nice guys.

RACHEL:
 oh, they're firemen guys. 

 you guys tell them you were married?

 no way!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 thank you.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 grazie.

RACHEL:
 and a nice hot cider for monica. 

MONICA:
 aww, thank you. 

RACHEL:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?

RACHEL:
 oh! that's why.   i'm sorry!  opening credits  

 chandler.

CHANDLER:
 mrs. tedlock. you're looking lovely today. and may i say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.

 yes. well, mr. kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.

CHANDLER:
 oh, listen. if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them. really. nothing at all. really.   nothing. 

PHOEBE:
 hey you guys! chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know... 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 never mind. but it was going to be really good.

ROSS:
 what's going on?

 what is it?

CHANDLER:
 so, it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.

 that's great!

CHANDLER:
 so.... i quit.

 why?

CHANDLER:
 why? this was supposed to be a temp job!

MONICA:
 yeah, chandler... you've been there for five years.

CHANDLER:
 if i took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do.

PHOEBE:
 so was it a lot more money?

CHANDLER:
 it doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the wenus. 

RACHEL:
 ... the wenus?

CHANDLER:
 weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 so what're you going to do?

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know what i want to do. i just know i'm not going to figure it out working there.

PHOEBE:
 oooh! i have something you can do! i have this new massage client... steve? 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 hi!  you're a chef. i know, and i thought of you first, but um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....

CHANDLER:
 yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 well, what kind of food is he looking for?

PHOEBE:
 well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i know! 

CHANDLER:
 thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat.

PHOEBE:
 ok.  

CHANDLER:
 can you see my nipples through this shirt?

RACHEL:
 no. but don't worry, i'm sure they're still there.

PHOEBE:
 where are you going, mr. suity-man?

CHANDLER:
 well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo. 

RACHEL:
 career counselor?

CHANDLER:
 hey, you guys all know what you want to do.

RACHEL:
 i don't!

CHANDLER:
 hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. you know, you have goals. you have dreams. i don't have a dream.

ROSS:
 ah, the lesser-known "i don't have a dream" speech. 

MONICA:
 oh, i love my life, i love my life!

PHOEBE:
 ooh! brian's song!

RACHEL:
 the meeting with the guy went great?

MONICA:
 so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it's this, it's this cute little place on 10th street. not too big, not too small. just right.

CHANDLER:
 was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?

MONICA:
 so anyway, i'm cooking dinner for him monday night. you know, kind of like an audition. and phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.

RACHEL:
 what are you going to make?

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 i don't know. i don't know. it's just going to be so great!

PHOEBE:
 ooh! i know what you could make!   i know! oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?  

ROSS:
 hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?

JOEY:
 how about tony's? if you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

ROSS:
 ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?

CHANDLER:
 who are you going out with?

PHOEBE:
 oh, is this the bug lady?

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 her name is celia. she's not a bug lady. she's curator of insects at the museum.

RACHEL:
 so what are you guys going to do?

ROSS:
 oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and i'd introduce her to my monkey.

CHANDLER:
 and he's not speaking metaphorically.

JOEY:
  

ROSS:
 well, i don't know....  huh-huh.

JOEY:
 i'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! she's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.  

ROSS:
 celia, don't worry!  don't scream!  he's not going to hurt you! soothing tones, celia. soothing tones! marcel...

 i can't stand this! he's got his claws in my...

ROSS:
 alright...   

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 is it better than the other salmon mousse?

JOEY:
 it's creamier.

MONICA:
 yeah, well, is that better?

JOEY:
 i don't know. we're talking about whipped fish, monica. i'm just happy i'm keeping it down, y'know? 

RACHEL:
 my god! what happened to you?

CHANDLER:
 eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do i learn?  are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."

PHOEBE:
 that's so great! 'cause you already know how to do that!

CHANDLER:
 can you believe it? i mean, don't i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? you know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something.

RACHEL:
  hey! you can see your nipples through this shirt!

MONICA:
  cheer you up.

CHANDLER:
 ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so i'd better split this with you.

MONICA:
 it's supposed to be that small. it's a pre-appetizer. the french call it an amouz-bouche. 

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
   right, i'll see you then. bye. 

PHOEBE:
 ten dollars an hour for what?

MONICA:
 oh, i asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 uh-oh.

MONICA:
 well... of course i thought of you! but... but...

RACHEL:
 but, but?

MONICA:
 but, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? and, well, wendy's more of a... professional waitress.

RACHEL:
 oh! i see. and i've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that i can waitress in the olympics.

CHANDLER:
 you know, i don't mean to brag, but i waited tables at innsbruck in '76.   

 talk to me.

ROSS:
 ok.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...

 no no no. talk... dirty.

ROSS:
 

 yes...

ROSS:
 ah....

 say something..... hot.

ROSS:
 

 what?

ROSS:
 um... uh.... vulva. commercial break  

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 alright, i panicked, alright? she took me by surprise. you know, but it wasn't a total loss. i mean, we ended up cuddling.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 shut up! it was nice. i just... i don't think i'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?

JOEY:
 what's the big deal? you just say what you want to do to her. or what you want her to do to you. or what you think other people might be doing to each other. i'll tell you what. just try something on me.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 why not? come on! just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.

ROSS:
 ok. 

JOEY:
 ....yeah... what else?

ROSS:
 that's it. i'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 joey, please.

JOEY:
 come on. come on. alright, ready, look!  you get me so hot. i want your lips on me now.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 alright, now you say something.

ROSS:
 i... ahem... i really don't think so.

JOEY:
 come on! you like this woman, right?

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 you want to see her again, right?

ROSS:
 sure.

JOEY:
 well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? now tell me you want to caress my butt!

ROSS:
 ok, turn around.  me when i'm doing this.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 ahem... i want.... ok, i want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.

JOEY:
 there you go! keep going. keep going!

ROSS:
 i, er...  both have their backs to him, so they don't notice. chandler sees the situation and 

ROSS:
 i want to take my tongue... and...  

ROSS:
 ....and....

JOEY:
 say it... say it!

ROSS:
 ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...  notice at the same time. they slowly stop, and then very slowly turn around to see 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 you're not going to believe this!

CHANDLER:
 it's ok. it's ok. i was always rooting for you two kids to get together.

JOEY:
 hey chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.

CHANDLER:
 again?

JOEY:
 and again, and again, and again...   and again.

CHANDLER:
   from your own home, you know?  this isn't about the money. i need something that's more than a job. i need something i can really care about....  mentioned earlier?  not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  telling you, you've got the wrong guy! you've got the wrong guy!  monday!  

CHANDLER:
 well?

PHOEBE:
  is a cube.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 yeah, i think we're ready for our first course.   ok, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...  ... ginger.

 well, smack my ass and call me judy! these are fantastic!

MONICA:
 i'm so glad you liked them!

 like 'em? i could eat a hundred of them!

MONICA:
 oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. but in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.

 tartlets. tartlets. tartlets. the word has lost all meaning.  

RACHEL:
 excuse me? can i help you with anything?

 you know, i don't know what i'm looking for.   drag on a joint, and monica thinks she's giving her the 'ok' signal. then rachel does it 

   you know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.

MONICA:
  to spoil your appetite.

 

MONICA:
 you know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...

 macaroni and cheese! we gotta make this!

MONICA:
 no, we don't. 

 oh, ok.   

MONICA:
 why don't you just have a seat here?   ok... give me the gummi-bears.

 

MONICA:
 give them to me.

 alright, we'll share.

MONICA:

MONICA:
 

 what?

MONICA:
 what?

 why?

MONICA:
 why? it's just that i've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet? 

  

JOEY:
 what a tool!

RACHEL:
 you don't want to work for a guy like that.

ROSS:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 i know... it's just... i thought this was, you know... it.

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 yeah! you know all those yummy noises? i wasn't faking. 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 oh, i was unbelievable.

JOEY:
 all right, ross!

ROSS:
 i was the james michener of dirty talk. it was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. i mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.

JOEY:
 whoa! and the... 

ROSS:
 well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...

JOEY:
 you cuddled.

ROSS:
 yeah, which was nice.

PHOEBE:
 you guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?

RACHEL:
 maybe, but shouldn't we wait for chandler?

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
  wenus and i'm not happy!...  something... you will care about it, because i care about it! you got it? good!   whooooaaaa.... closing credits

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

 hi. okay, will that be all? 

CHANDLER:

 yeah, um, i was over there, then you said, "excuse me, hello miss," so now im here. 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

 yeah. okay great. im gonna be over here.  

 no, no, no! opening credits   

ROSS:
 i dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. but, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident. 

RACHEL:
 no, yeah, ive done that. 

ROSS:
 and then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before i did, and peed all over the crossword. 

RACHEL:
 ive never done that.  by bending down to look underneath the shops signa large steaming cup of  

CHANDLER:
 all right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister. 

JOEY:
 im sayin i see a difference. 

CHANDLER:
 theyre twins! 

JOEY:
 i dont care. phoebes phoebe. ursulas... hot!  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

 hey guys! hey! 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
 yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh... 

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 oh, you do? because she said you guys havent talked in like years. 

PHOEBE:
 hmmm? yeah. so, um, is she fat? 

JOEY:
 not from where i was standin. 

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 um, pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along? 

PHOEBE:
 its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, i mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though i did it... later that same day. but, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?" 

ROSS:
 oh, pheebs, im sorry, ive got to go. ive got lamaze class. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, and ive got earth science, but i'll catch you in gym. 

RACHEL:
 so, is this just gonna be you and carol? 

ROSS:
 no, susans gonna be there too. weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team. 

RACHEL:
 well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird? 

ROSS:
 no, no.  at first, but by now i, i think im pretty comfortable with the whole situation. 

MONICA:
 ross, thats my jacket. 

ROSS:
 i know.   themselves to the teacher, whos got as far as a woman sitting next to ross, carol,  

 hi, were the rostins. err, im j.c., and hes michael, and were having a boy, and a girl. 

 good for you. alrighty, next? 

ROSS:

 im sorry, i didnt get... susan is? 

ROSS:
 susan is carols, carols, carols, friend... 

 life partner. 

ROSS:

 like lovers. 

ROSS:
 you know how close women can get.   

 susan and i live together. 

ROSS:
 although i was married to her. 

 carol, not me. 

ROSS:
 err, right. 

 its a little complicated. 

ROSS:
 a little. 

 but were fine. 

ROSS:
 absolutely.  thats like two births.    

CHANDLER:
 and  

  

CHANDLER:
 oh, okay. send her in.  from a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. an attractive young woman opens the  

 hi. 

CHANDLER:
 hi, nina. come on in. 

 you wanted to see me? 

CHANDLER:
 uh, yes. yes. ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your friday numbers. 

 which is bad, because? 

CHANDLER:
 well, it throws my wenus out of whack. 

 your... excuse me? 

CHANDLER:
 wenus.  

 oh, net usage statistics, right. gotcha, gotcha. wont happen again. i wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."  lost for something to say &ndash; so she nods her head to tell him that hes    

CHANDLER:
 its not just that shes cute, okay. its just that... shes really really cute. 

ROSS:
 it doesnt matter. you dont dip your pen in the company ink.  

MONICA:
 ross, your little creatures got the remote again. 

ROSS:
 marcel, marcel, give rossie the remote. marcel. marcel, you give rossie the remote right now... marce... you give rossie the remote...  combination of keys. the logo sap appears on the screen, and suddenly the dialogue is  

MONICA:
 great. 

ROSS:
 relax, ill fix it. 

RACHEL:
  "urkel." 

ROSS:
  

CHANDLER:
  christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?   

MONICA:
 ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around new years... but obviously someone forgot. 

RACHEL:
 well, someone was supposed to write "rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate...   how long has that been there?  

CHANDLER:
 hey, where you been? 

JOEY:
 i went back to riffs. i think ursula likes me. all i ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries. 

CHANDLER:
 score. 

JOEY:
 she is so hot! 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, listen. okay, before you do anything joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...  

JOEY:
 pheebs? 

PHOEBE:
  

JOEY:
 you think it would be okay if i asked out your sister? 

PHOEBE:
 why? why would you wanna... do that?  why? 

JOEY:
 so that if we went out on a date, shed be there. 

PHOEBE:
 well, i mean, im not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... i mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... i dont know, why not? okay. 

JOEY:
 cool, thanks.   

ROSS:
 you okay? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah im fine. 

ROSS:
 you wanna watch laverne y shirley?  do a little dance with their chopsticks, and phoebe has to grin as ross joins in the   finished learning how to change a diaper. as ross rushes in, stepping on the rostins pretend baby, squashing its head flat. it bleats, in protest. he performs emergency  

ROSS:
 sorry. 

ROSS:
 hi. sorry im late. wheres, wheres carol? 

 stuck at school. some parent-teacher thing. you can go. ill get the information. 

ROSS:
 no... no... no. i think i should stay, i think we should both know whats going on. 

 oh, good. thisll be fun. 

 alrighty. were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so mummies, why dont you get on your back? and... coaches, you should be supporting mummys head.  

 what? what? what? 

 i am supposed to be the mommy? 

ROSS:
 okay, im gonna play my sperm card one more time. 

 look, i dont see why i should have to miss out on the coaching training just because im a woman. 

ROSS:
 i see. so what do you propose to do? 

 i will flip you for it. 

ROSS:
 flip me for it? no, no, no... heads, heads, heads! 

    

 alright, mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.  

 good. now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.    

CHANDLER:
 mr. d, hows it going, sir? 

 ohh, its been better. the annual net usage statistics are in. 

CHANDLER:
 and? 

 its pretty ugly. we havent seen an anus this bad since the seventies. 

CHANDLER:
 so what does this mean? 

 well, were gonna be layin off people in every department. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, listen, i know i came in late last week, but i slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash; 

 not you. relax. ever have to fire anyone?  

CHANDLER:
 nina? nina.   nina.  

 are you okay? 

CHANDLER:
  called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me. 

  

CHANDLER:
    

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 well, what i really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me. 

RACHEL:
 okay... let me put it this way. anything from crabtree and evelyn? 

PHOEBE:
 ooh! bath salts would be nice. 

RACHEL:
 ooh, okay... good.   

 what is this place? 

 look, youre cold, i have to pee, and...  ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. how bad could it be?  

 i think we have an answer. 

 whats she doing here? 

 this could be gods way of telling us to eat at home. 

 think she got fired at riffs? 

 no, no, no. we were there last night. she kept...  ..bringing swordfish.  

 im gonna wait till after we order. its her, right. 

 it looks like her.  

 um, excuse me. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah? 

 hi, its us. 

PHOEBE:
  

 so, so youre here too? 

PHOEBE:
 much as you are. 

  

 err... we know what we want. 

PHOEBE:
  

 all we want is two caffe lattes. 

 and some biscottie cookies. 

PHOEBE:
 good choice.   

 definitely her. 

 yeah. commercial break  of the waltons. at a nearby table sit monica knitting, rachel winding a ball of wool, and   

MONICA:
 i cant believe you. you still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet? 

CHANDLER:
 well, you still havent taken down the christmas lights. 

MONICA:
 congratulations, i think youve found the worlds thinnest argument. 

CHANDLER:
 im just trying to find the right moment, you know? 

RACHEL:
 oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating.  quickie before i go to work?"  

JOEY:
 hey. 

 hey.  

CHANDLER:
 you know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more. 

MONICA:
 ill get it.   

MONICA:
 oh. hi, mr.heckles. 

 youre doing it again. 

MONICA:
 were not doing anything. were just sitting around talking, quietly. 

 i can hear you through the ceiling. my cats cant sleep. 

RACHEL:
 you dont even have cats. 

 i could have cats. 

MONICA:
  

RACHEL:
 well try to keep it down.   

JOEY:
 phoebe, could you do me a favour? could you try this on? i just wanna make sure it fits. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, my first birthday present...   ..oh, this is really... 

JOEY:
 oh, no no no. its for ursula. i just figured, you know, size-wise. 

PHOEBE:
 ohhh... sure, yeah...  ..okay, it fits.  

RACHEL:
 are you seein her again tonight? 

JOEY:
 yep. ice capades. 

CHANDLER:
 wow, this is serious. ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade. 

JOEY:
 i dont know. i like her, you know. shes different. theres uh, somethin about her. 

PHOEBE:
 that you like,   we get it. you like her. great!  

JOEY:
 hey, phoebe, i asked you, and you said it was okay. 

PHOEBE:
 alright, well, maybe now its not okay. 

JOEY:
 okay... well maybe now im not okay with it not being okay. 

PHOEBE:
 okay.  

CHANDLER:
 knit, good woman, knit, knit!    someone knocks, so they hurriedly separate to stare out of the window. chandlers  

CHANDLER:
 and thats the chrysler building right there. 

 nina. 

 mr.douglas...    

   shes still here. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, yes she is. didnt i memo you on this? see, after i let her go, err, i got a call from her psychiatrist, dr. flanen-nen, dr. flanen, dr. flan.     

CHANDLER:
 and err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy. 

 youre kidding? she seems so... 

CHANDLER:
 oh, no, no. nina...  whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! in fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. 

 thats unbelievable. 

CHANDLER:
 and yet, believable. so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. 

 i see. i guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head. 

CHANDLER:
 well, i guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.  to follow nina down the corridor, he realises bing must be telling the truth, since he   carol is cradled in his lap, and she has a pretend baby, on her lap. the teacher is  

 ..a sound mom and dad never forget. for this after all, is the miracle of birth. 

 lights please? and thats having a baby. next week is our final class.   

ROSS:
 susan, go deep.   

 this is impossible. its just impossible. 

 what is, honey? 

 what that woman... did. i am not doin that. its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in. 

ROSS:
 carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright. 

  saying, "hi, is that your nostril?  mind if we push this pot roast through it?" 

 carol, carol, sweetie. cleansing breath.   

 i know its frightening, but, big picture. the birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.  

 i mean, thats what this is all about, right? ross? ross?   

ROSS:
 im gonna be a father. 

RACHEL:
 this is just occurring to you? 

ROSS:
 i always knew i was havin a baby, i just never realised the baby was having me. 

RACHEL:
  

ROSS:
 aw, how can you say that? i cant even get marcel to stop eating the bath mat. how am i gonna raise a kid? 

CHANDLER:
 you know, ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.  

PHOEBE:
 wherere you going? 

JOEY:
 out. 

PHOEBE:
 with? 

JOEY:
  

PHOEBE:
 alright, could i just ask you one question?  

PHOEBE:
 have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet? 

JOEY:
 well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?  

JOEY:
 you meant sex, right?   

 do you have a sec? 

CHANDLER:
 ah, sure, nina. whats up? 

 i dont know. for the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us. 

 maybe. but that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors. 

CHANDLER:
 ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise. 

 i am? 

CHANDLER:
 sure, why not? 

 oh my god!  

CHANDLER:
 oh, you dont know.  we put through the paperwork on miss bookbinders raise? 

  to personnel? 

 what? 

CHANDLER:
 helen drinks.     

CHANDLER:
 well, i ended up telling her everything. 

RACHEL:
 oh, howd she take it? 

CHANDLER:
 pretty well. except for the stapler thing. 

 if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand...  

MONICA:
 okay, i think i get how to do this.   

PHOEBE:
 alright, so, can we turn this off? can we just make it... make them go away? because i cant, i cant watch. 

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 are you alright? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. its just, you know, its this whole stupid ursula thing, its... 

RACHEL:
 okay, pheebs, can i ask? so, hes going out with her. i mean, is it really so terrible? 

PHOEBE:
 um, yeah. look, i mean, im not saying shes like evil or anything. she just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. when i was eight, and i wouldnt let her have my judy jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. and then, oh, and then there was randy brown, who was like... have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? 

  

PHOEBE:
 well, but thats what he was for me. and she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us. 

RACHEL:
 oh... oh, pheebs. 

PHOEBE:
 i mean, i know joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but... 

CHANDLER:
 youre not gonna lose him. 

MONICA:
 hon, you gotta talk to joey. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. okay. 

ROSS:
 no, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. if he knew how you felt. 

PHOEBE:
 but hes falling in love with her. 

RACHEL:
 oh please, theyve been going out a week. they havent even slept together yet, i mean, thats not serious. 

PHOEBE:
 okay... okay.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay, oh.  apartment is shut. she knocks, and anxiously waits for joey to come, but instead her  

    

 yeah, um, may we help you? closing credits   

MONICA:

ROSS:
 i had a dream last night where i was playing football with my kid.

 that's nice.

ROSS:
 no, no, with him.  on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and i, i know i've gotta do something 'cause the tampa bay defence is comin' right at me.

JOEY:
 tampa bay's got a terrible team.

ROSS:
 right, but, it is just me and the baby, so i'm thinkin' they can take us. and so i uh, hah-hah, i just heave it down field.

CHANDLER:
 what are you crazy? that's a baby!

JOEY:
 he should take the sack?

ROSS:
 anyway, suddenly i'm down field, and i realise that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? only i know there is no way i'm gonna get there in time, so i am running, and running, and that, that is when i woke up. see i, i am so not ready to be a father.

CHANDLER:
 hey, you're gonna be fine. you're one of the most caring, most responsible men in north america. you're gonna make a great dad.

JOEY:
 yeah, ross. you and the baby just need better blocking. 

JOEY:
 oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the rainbow room? is it real expensive?

CHANDLER:
 well, only if you order stuff.

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 oh, man. what're the odds of that happening? 

ROSS:
 you take your time. 

CHANDLER:
 there it is! so what're you gonna do?

JOEY:
 what can i do? look, i don't want to do anything to screw it up with ursula.

CHANDLER:
 and your friend phoebe?

JOEY:
 well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. i mean, wouldn't you guys?

CHANDLER:
 man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.   

 ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference. 

 okay, errrr, monica?

MONICA:
 yes?  rachel  monica 

 

  dr.rosen. 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.

MONICA:
 uh, you left out the stupid part.

RACHEL:
 not stupid. the very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and i said "yes."

MONICA:
 i think it's totally insane, i mean, they work for the hospital. it's like returning to the scene of the crime. you know, i say we blow off the dates.

RACHEL:
 what? monica, they are cute, they are doctors,   cute doctors, doctors who are cute!

CHANDLER:
 alright, what have we learned so far?  and hides, except for monica and rachel who answer their door. ross stands in the doorway, 

   then lands with a squishy thud, its contents oozing out onto the floor. ross is not 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
  scary. hi everybody. hi betty! betty, hi!   this is great. everybody i love is in the same room,   

CHANDLER:
 did you see betty?    

 i tell you one thing, i wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, i'd say "get out of my office!"

ROSS:
 dad, before i was born, did you freak out at all?

 i'm not freaking out, i'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;

ROSS:
 dad, dad, dad, i'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "oh my god i'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?

 no. your mother really did the work. i was busy with the business. i wasn't around that much. is that what this is about?

ROSS:
 no, no, dad, i was just wondering.

 'cause there's time to make up for that. we can do stuff together. you always wanted to go to that colonial williamsburg. how 'bout we do that?

ROSS:
 thanks, dad, really, i ju... you know, i just, i just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?

 oh, well, i, i guess it musta been the day after you were born. we were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. you were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. and you squeezed it, so tight. and that's when i knew. 

 so you don't wanna go to williamsburg?

ROSS:
 no, we can go to williamsburg.

 eat your fish.  

MONICA:
 rachel, the cute doctors are here.

RACHEL:
  

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 it will not be fine. we'll get in trouble.

RACHEL:
 oh, monica! would you stop being such a wuss?

MONICA:
 a wuss? excuse me for living in the real world, okay? 

 so?

 so... they sss-still seem normal.

 that's because they are.

  women we meet at the hospital... it turns into...

 willya relax? look around. no pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine.   

MONICA:
 i said we are not going to do it, okay? sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
  do that!  in the vicious pause which follows. the telephone rings, but the girls just glower at each other, silently daring the other to move first. finally both guys jump up, and michael 

  just one second... 

MONICA:
   li-listen, dad, i can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that i've been meaning to tell you... 

RACHEL:
 would you excuse me for a second?

MONICA:
   well, billy dreskin and i had sex on your bed.  she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way to turn. finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned dr. mitchell looks philosophically at dr. rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan  commercial break  round the coffee table, playing scrabble. rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading 

RACHEL:
  dreskin? his father tried to put you out of business!   ...dead!  

MONICA:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 

 

MONICA:
  signature on the admissions form. well, it turns out we need a whole new one  um...

 you're that stupid.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 okay, worst case scenario. say you never feel like a father.

ROSS:
 uh-huh.

CHANDLER:
 say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 what's up with the simian?

ROSS:
 it's just a fur ball.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

ROSS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
    the petals of a flower, alternately looking hopeful and annoyed. phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. she hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. nervously, she smooths out the 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 urse... 

JOEY:
 ..ah, what're you doing here? i've been trying to call you.

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
  should just forget about what i said under the bridge, i was talkin' crazy that night, i was so drunk!

JOEY:
 you don't drink.

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 oh, urse... 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 why? is it because i'm friends with phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
  either her or me.

JOEY:
 then, uh, then i'm sorry.  

PHOEBE:
  you're gonna be really, really hard to get over.

JOEY:
 i know...  

JOEY:
 i don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.

PHOEBE:
 really?  leave but stops suddenly. phoebe silently shouts "oh, whoa!!" to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. a thoughtful joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various 

JOEY:
 pheebs?

PHOEBE:
   anaesthetic, tucked up under a sheet like an infant in a huge bed. ross sits beside him, 

ROSS:
 he looks so tiny. 

JOEY:
 we just got the message.

PHOEBE:
 is he alright?

ROSS:
 yeah. the doctor got the 'k' out. he also found an 'm' and an 'o'.

CHANDLER:
 we think he was trying to spell out 'monkey.' 

ROSS:
 well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 no, why?

CHANDLER:
 hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad. 

MONICA:
 oh, look, he's waking up!

ROSS:
   so tight, that ross finally knows what it is to be a father. he looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, rachel tenderly resting her chin upon monica's shoulder. ross  closing credits  of the window and ross is handing out some chinese takeout.  there's a small sap in 

ROSS:
 aqui está. 

MONICA:
 ¿a quién pidio el pollo general tso?  

CHANDLER:
 ¡pudo aver sido general tso!  

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
  

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:

ROSS:
 oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'read 'em and weep.'

CHANDLER:
 and then he did.

RACHEL:
 well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, what is that? like, some kind of guy thing? like, some kind of sexist guy thing? like it's poker, so only guys can play?

ROSS:
 no, women are welcome to play.

PHOEBE:
 oh, ok, so then what is it? some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?

CHANDLER:
 there just don't happen to be any women in our games.

JOEY:
 yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.

 oh, yeah, right.

MONICA:
 oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!

RACHEL:
 really.

MONICA:
 i mean, that's a typical guy response.

ROSS:
 excuse me, do any of you know how to play?

 no.

RACHEL:
 but you could teach us.

 no. 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 so i wouldn't need any, right? cause i have a straight.

RACHEL:
 oh, good for you!

PHOEBE:
 congratulations! 

CHANDLER:
 ok phoebs, how many do you want?

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 alright, here we go. we've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.

 ooooooo!

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, monica, what're you doin'? this is a poker game. you can't serve food with more than one syllable. it's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 alright, you know, we got it, we got it. let's play for real. high stakes... big bucks...

ROSS:

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 heh... i was bluffing.

PHOEBE:
 a-ha! and... what is bluffing? is it not another word for... lying?

RACHEL:
 ok, sorry to break up this party, but i've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... 

 whoa, whoa, whoa!

CHANDLER:
 rach, rach, we gotta settle.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 the... jamestown colony of virginia. you see, king george is giving us the land, so...

ROSS:
 the game, rachel, the game. you owe us money for the game.

RACHEL:
 oh. right.

JOEY:
 you know what, you guys? it's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?

MONICA:
 hell no, we'll pay!

PHOEBE:
 ok, monica? i had another answer all ready.

MONICA:
 and you know what? we want a rematch.

ROSS:
 well that's fine with me. could use the money.

RACHEL:
  your friends.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 yes, and i get my ya-yas from ikea. you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.

ROSS:
 look, rachel, this is poker. i play to win, alright? in order for me to win, other people have to lose. so if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' ok? cause once those cards are dealt... 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 i'm not a nice guy. 

ROSS:
 alright boys, let's eat.

CHANDLER:
 oh, did you get that from the 'i love rachel' pizzeria?

ROSS:
 you still on that?

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on. what was with that whole black bart speech?  "when i play poker, i'm not a nice guy!"

ROSS:
 you are way off, pal.

JOEY:
 no, i don't think so, see ross, because i think you love her.

ROSS:
 um.... no. see, i might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. i justi... 

ROSS:
 marcel! where are you going with that disc? 

ROSS:
 you are not putting that on again! marcel, okif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.  

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh, hello, kettle? this is monica. you're black.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh, i beg to differ. the pictionary incident?

MONICA:
 that was not an incident! i-i was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.

RACHEL:
 oooooh.  interview!

MONICA:
 you're kidding! where? where?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 oh, rachel!

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.

MONICA:
 well, what's the job?

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 ok, look. that is aunt iris. this woman has been playing poker since she was five. you gotta listen to every word she says.

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 i don't think so.

RACHEL:

 well, he may be now, because i think i hit him with my car.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh my god!

MONICA:

 no! that's bluffing. lesson number one.  tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap.  earrings.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending trident?

RACHEL:
 noooo... the interview! she loved me! she absolutely loved me. we talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, i went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. i can do this. i can do this well!

 that's great! that's wonderful!

RACHEL:
 oh god, oh, and then she told the funniest story...

MONICA:
 ok, great. you'll tell us and we'll laugh. let's play poker.

JOEY:
 alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.

CHANDLER:
 oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, i don't know... pictionary? 

MONICA:
 ha, ha, very funny, very funny. but i think we'd like to give poker another try. shall we, ladies?

 yes, we should. i think we should.

ROSS:
 uh, rach, do you want me to shuffle those?

RACHEL:
 no, no, thats ok. y'know, i think i'm gonna give it a go.

ROSS:
 alright.

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 so, phoebs owes $7.50, monica, you owe $10, and rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 alright, here's my $7.50.  know that this money is cursed.

JOEY:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i cursed it. so now bad things will happen to he who spends it.

CHANDLER:
 that's alright, i'll take it. bad things happen to me anyway. this way i can break 'em up with a movie.

ROSS:
 well, that just leaves the big green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

RACHEL:
 mmm-hmmm. oh, so typical. ooo, i'm a man. ooo, i have a penis. ooo, i have to win money to exert my power over women. 

MONICA:
 you know what? this is not over. we will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.

RACHEL:
 hmm. kinda stepped on my point there, mon. 

ROSS:
 so, you gals wanna hand over your money now? that way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.

RACHEL:
 ooooh, that's fine. we'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

MONICA:
 ok, we done with the chit-chat? are we ready to play some serious poker?

PHOEBE:
  the one-eyed jack follows me wherever i go.  

MONICA:
 excuse me, where are you going?

ROSS:

MONICA:
 do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?

ROSS:
 i want to go to the bathroom. 

JOEY:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 hi.

RACHEL:
 oh, i'm sorry. oh, this is so stupid! i mean, i gave barry up, right? i should be happy for them! i am, i'm happy for them.

ROSS:
 really.

RACHEL:
 no. oh, oh, i guess it would be different if i were- with somebody.

ROSS:
 whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'forget relationships! i'm done with men!' the whole, uh, penis embargo?

RACHEL:
 oh, i don't know. i guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? i mean, with barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. with paolo, that's all there was, was heat! and it was just this raw, animal, sexual...

ROSS:
 wait-wait. i, i got it. i was there.

RACHEL:
 well, i mean, do you think you can ever have both? y'know? someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?

ROSS:
 yes. yes. yes! yes, i really do! in fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who... 

MONICA:
 hi.

ROSS:
 ...gets interrupted. hi!

RACHEL:
 hi, how was the movie?

MONICA:
 wonderful!

PHOEBE:
 so good!

JOEY:
 suck-fest.

CHANDLER:
 toootal chick-flick.

PHOEBE:
 i-i'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...

JOEY:
 hey, i don't need violence to enjoy a movie. just so long as there's a little nudity.

MONICA:
 there was nudity!

JOEY:
 i meant female nudity. alright? i don't need to see lou grant frolicking.

 hugh! hugh grant!

ROSS:
 alright, i've gotta go. c'mon, marcel! c'mon! we're gonna go take a bath. yes we are, aren't we? yes, we are.

CHANDLER:
 they're still just friends, right?

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 that's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's, aren't you.

MONICA:
 oh, hang on, hang on. does aunt monica get a say in this?

ROSS:
 'pwease, aunt monica, pwease?' oh, unclench. you're not even gonna be there. 

CHANDLER:
 i can't believe we are even having this discussion.

JOEY:
 i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief.

CHANDLER:
 i mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened already?

ROSS:
 i'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.

JOEY:
 she really said that?

ROSS:
 well, i added the 'exactly like me' part... but she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.

JOEY:
 'tonight' tonight?

ROSS:
 well, i think it's perfect. y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...

CHANDLER:
 i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey.

ROSS:
 anyway, i figured after work i'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.

CHANDLER:
 hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.  

RACHEL:
 now, now the one in the feather boa, that's dr. francis. now, she used to be a man. okay, now look, see, there's raven. we hate her. we're glad she's dying. okay-  monica's shoes? you know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. marcel, did you poo in the shoe?   sorry, barry. little engagement gift. i'm sure you didn't register for that.  holding the newsletter at arm's length. however, she leaves the door open. marcel runs out  who died? who died? roll him over! oh, c'mon, roll him over! oh...! well, we know it wasn't dexter, right marcel? because-   

JOEY:
 how could you lose him?

RACHEL:
 i don't know. we were watching tv, and then he pooped in monica's shoe-

MONICA:
 wait. he pooped in my shoe? which one?

RACHEL:
 i don't know. the left one.

MONICA:
 which ones?

RACHEL:
 oh. oh, those little clunky amish things you think go with everything.

PHOEBE:
 

 hi.

PHOEBE:
 whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?

CHANDLER:
 rachel lost marcel.

PHOEBE:
 oh no, how?

MONICA:
 he- he pooped in my shoe.

PHOEBE:
 which one?

MONICA:
 those cute little black ones i wear all the time.

PHOEBE:
 no, which one? the right or left? 'cause the left one is lucky...

RACHEL:
 c'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?

JOEY:
 alright alright. you're a monkey. you're loose in the city. where do you go?

CHANDLER:
 okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. i'll go to cats, you go to the russian tea room.

RACHEL:
 oh, my, god, c'mon, you guys! he's gonna be home any minute! he's gonna kill me!

MONICA:
 okay, we'll start with the building. you guys take the first and second floor, phoebe and i'll take third and fourth.

RACHEL:
 well, what'm i gonna do? what'm i gonna do?

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 great! it went great. really great. hey, is that wine?

ROSS:
 yeah. you, uh, you want some?

RACHEL:
 oh, i would love some. but y'know what? y'know what? let's not drink it here. i'm feeling kinda crazy. you wanna go to newark?

ROSS:
 uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the north-east, i was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  well-

RACHEL:
 oh god, ross, i cannot do this.

ROSS:
 okay, quick and painful. 

RACHEL:
 oh god... okay. alright. alright. okay. ross, please don't hate me.

ROSS:
 oh, what? what-what?

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 ...yeah?

RACHEL:
 well, i kind of... i kind of lost him.   commercial break 

ROSS:
  was keep him in the apartment.

RACHEL:
 i know, i know, i'm sorry-

ROSS:
 no, y'know what, i guess it's partially my fault. y'know, i shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. i should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.

RACHEL:
  looking for him, and i- 

 animal control.

RACHEL:
 see? i've even called animal control!

ROSS:
 you called animal control?

RACHEL:
 uh-huh... why... do you not like them?

ROSS:
 marcel is an illegal exotic animal. i'm not allowed to have him in the city. if they find him, they'll take him away from me.

RACHEL:
 o-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...

ROSS:
 that's right, i.. 'cause i didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment! 

RACHEL:
 hi, thanks for coming.

 

RACHEL:
 oh, y'know what? that was a complete misunderstanding!  

ROSS:
 yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.

RACHEL:
 turned out it was a hat.

ROSS:
 cat!

RACHEL:
 cat! what'm i saying? cat! 

MONICA:
 hi. we checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen marcel.

 marcel?

ROSS:
 my uncle marcel.

PHOEBE:
 oh, is that who the monkey's named after?

 oookay. are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?

PHOEBE:
 oh my god. you'd put that poor little creature in jail?

MONICA:
 pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?

PHOEBE:
 yes, but there isn't always time!

MONICA:
 look. i'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! um, have a seat. first of all, we haven't been introduced, i'm monica geller.

 oh my god, you are! and you're rachel green!

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 luisa? oh my god! monica! it's luisa!

MONICA:
 the luisa from home room!

RACHEL:
 yes!!

 you have no idea who i am, do you.

MONICA:
 no, none at all.

RACHEL:
 none.

 well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. i mean, would it have been so hard to say 'morning, luisa'? or 'nice overalls'?

MONICA:
 oh, i'm- i'm so sorry!

 ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.   but you? what a bitch!

RACHEL:
 what?!

MONICA:
 be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? y'know, just for old times' sake? go bobcats?

 i could... but i won't. if i find that monkey, he's mine. 

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 yes have you seen any?

 no. no, haven't seen a monkey. do you know anything about fixing radiators?

JOEY:
 um, sure! did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?

 of course.

JOEY:
 oh. then, no. 

 did i put too much rum in here? 

 just a sec.  

CHANDLER:
 oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.

JOEY:
 uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?

CHANDLER:
 yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! and they're very hot.

JOEY:
 we can't, alright?  but... we promised we'd find this monkey. if you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 marc- oh, this is ridiculous! we've been all over the neighbourhood. he's gone, he's-he's just gone.

RACHEL:
 ross, you don't know that.

ROSS:
 oh come on. it's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the village.   and now i have a broken foot. i have no monkey, and a broken foot! thank you very much.

RACHEL:
 ross, i said i'm sorry like a million times. what do you want me to do? you want me to break my foot too? okay, i'm gonna break my foot, right here.   ow!! oh! oh my god, oh my god! there, are you happy now?!

ROSS:
 yeah, yeah. y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! i don't miss marcel any more!

RACHEL:
 y'know, it is not like i did this on purpose.

ROSS:
 oh, no no no. nono, this is just vintage rachel. i mean, things just sort of happen around you. i mean, you're off in rachel-land, doing your rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...

RACHEL:
 ross.

ROSS:
 i don't even wanna hear it, you're just...

RACHEL:
 ross.

ROSS:
 oh, forget it, okay?

RACHEL:
 ross!

ROSS:
 what? what?  

 hey! hey, bananaman!  

PHOEBE:
 oh, this is so intense. one side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea. 

ROSS:
 hi, did you order some bananas?

 what about it?

ROSS:
 gimme back my monkey.

 i don't have a monkey.

RACHEL:
 then what's with all the bananas?

 potassium.  

ROSS:
 marcel? marcel? okay, where is he? where is he? marcel? marcel? 

ROSS:
 marcel! what've you done to him?

 that's my monkey. that's patti, patti the monkey.

ROSS:
 are you insane? c'mere, marcel, c'mon. 

 c'mere, patti. 

ROSS:
 c'mere, marcel. 

 c'mere, patti. 

   gotcha.

ROSS:
 okay, gimme my monkey back.

 that's my monkey.

 you're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.

 that's not my monkey. just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.

ROSS:
 alright, i want my monkey.

 no!

RACHEL:
 oh, c'mon, luisa!

 sorry, prom queen.

ROSS:
  fat.

RACHEL:
 alright. in high school i was the prom queen and i was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! but if you take this monkey, i will lose one of the most important people in my life. you can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. c'mon, luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! take it!

 nope.

RACHEL:
 alright. well then how about i call your supervisor, and i tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?  

ROSS:
 it'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? yes it will.   or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.

RACHEL:
 y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.

ROSS:
 listen, i'm- i'm sorry i was so hard on you before, it's just i...

RACHEL:
 oh, ross, c'mon. it's my fault, i almost lost your...

ROSS:
 yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? you, you were great. ...hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. you in the mood for, uh, something grape?

RACHEL:
 that'd be good.

ROSS:
 alright.   the, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.  not on the subject, i was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, i was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um... 

 rachel.

RACHEL:
 barry?!

 i can't. i can't do it, i can't marry mindy. i think i'm still in love with you.

 oh!

ROSS:
 we have got to start locking that door! closing credits  

MONICA:
 this is me in the sound of music. see the von trapp kids?

PHOEBE:
 nope.

MONICA:
 that's because i'm in front of them.

CHANDLER:
 eh. i thought that was an alp.

MONICA:
 well, high school was not my favourite time.

JOEY:
 i dunno, i loved high school. y'know? it was just four years of parties and dating and sex.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys. any sex i had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.

MONICA:
 gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?

CHANDLER:
 i can't believe you would actually say that. i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty.

JOEY:
 no way! mr.salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.

ROSS:
 i don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. they're craaazy.

MONICA:
  this! there's some creep out there with a telescope!

ROSS:
 i can't believe it! he's looking right at us!

RACHEL:
 oh, that is so sick.

CHANDLER:
 i feel violated. and not in a good way.

PHOEBE:
 how can people do that?...   oh, you guys, look! ugly naked guy got gravity boots! opening credits 

CHANDLER:
 i am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. it was unbelievable! we could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...

MONICA:
 so have you called her yet?

CHANDLER:
 let her know i like her? what are you, insane?   it's the next day! how needy do i want to seem?  right, right?

 oh, yeah. yeah. let her dangle.

MONICA:
 i can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.

PHOEBE:
 oh, god, just do it!  testosteroney!

CHANDLER:
 which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat.   i got her machine.

JOEY:
 her answer machine?

CHANDLER:
 no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.

PHOEBE:
 so, uh, why didn't you say anything?

CHANDLER:
 oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase "yes indeedy-o."

MONICA:
 look look! it's rachel and barry. no, don't everybody look at once!

ROSS:
 okay, okay, what's going on?

PHOEBE:
 okay, they're just talking...

ROSS:
 yeah, well, does he look upset? does he look like he was just told to shove anything?

PHOEBE:
 no, no actually, he's smiling.. and... oh my god, don't do that!!

ROSS:
 what? what? what?!

PHOEBE:
 that man across the street just kicked that pigeon! 

CHANDLER:
 

 oh!... right!

CHANDLER:
 hey rach!

MONICA:
 how'd it go?

RACHEL:
 y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. he took me to lunch at the russian tea room, and i had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...

PHOEBE:
 not a good day for birds...

RACHEL:
 then we took a walk down to bendall's, and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel...

ROSS:
 that's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?

RACHEL:
 right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? it was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!

ROSS:
 that's, that's nice twice!

MONICA:
 rachel, what's going on? i mean isn't this the same barry who you left at the altar?

JOEY:
 duh, where've you been?

RACHEL:
 yeah, but it was different with him today! and he wasn't, like, orthodontist guy, y'know? i mean, we had fun! is there anything wrong with that? 

CHANDLER:
 yes!

RACHEL:
 why?

CHANDLER:
 i have my reasons.

MONICA:
 okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?

RACHEL:
 all right. all right, all right, all right, all right, i know it's stupid! i will go see him this afternoon, and i will just put an end to it! 

RACHEL:
 wow... wow!

 yeah.

RACHEL:
 i'm not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that.

 nooo, it wasn't.

RACHEL:
 ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... 

CHANDLER:
  machine... give me a call when you get a chance.   oh god!

MONICA:
 that's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!

CHANDLER:
 hey, i've been honing!

ROSS:
 what was with the dishes?

CHANDLER:
 oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like i haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.

MONICA:
  the telescope!

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!  here!

MONICA:
 great, now he's waving back.

JOEY:
 man, we gotta do something about that guy. this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment. it creeps me out! i feel like i can't do stuff!

MONICA:
 what kinda stuff?

JOEY:
 will you grow up? i'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when i'm cooking naked.

PHOEBE:
 you cook naked?

JOEY:
 yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. 

CHANDLER:
 what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that. 

 what's the matter?

RACHEL:
 oh, it's just... oh, barry, this was not good.

 no, it was. it was very very good.

RACHEL:
 well, what about mindy?

 oh, way, way better than mindy.

RACHEL:
 no, not that, i mean, what about you and mindy?

 well, if you want, i'll justi'll just break it off with her.

RACHEL:
 no. no-no-no-no, no. i mean, don't do that. not, i mean not for me. 

 

 

RACHEL:
 oh, barry..! come on, this is all way too..

 we can, we can go to aruba! when i went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. you would've liked it. 

RACHEL:
 i had a bra.  

 hey, dr. farber. 

 all right miss green, everything looks fine... yep, i think we're starting to see some real progress here. 

RACHEL:
 what?!

 i'm twelve, i'm not stupid.  

CHANDLER:
 can i use your phone?

MONICA:
 yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, it's working! why isn't she calling me back?

JOEY:
 maybe she never got your message.

PHOEBE:
 y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.

CHANDLER:
 y'don't think that makes me seem a little...

ROSS:
 ...desperate, needy, pathetic?

CHANDLER:
 ah, you obviously saw my personal ad. 

PHOEBE:
 how many beeps?

CHANDLER:
 she answered.

MONICA:
 y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.

CHANDLER:
 i'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy. 

 hey! hi!

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 i can't call her, i left a message! i have some pride.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 no!  uh, listen, i don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that i am, i accidentally shut off my phone.   call me back.  back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 's'why i'm dancing... 

RACHEL:

 hey, you.

RACHEL:
 hey, you.... so, what's up?

 um.. we should really be sitting for this.

RACHEL:
 sure we should... so.

 now, i know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... except for maybe laurie schaffer, who i don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....okay, i'm just gonna ask you this once, and i want a straight answer.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 will you be my maid of honour?

RACHEL:
 of course!

 oh that's so great!

RACHEL:
 was that all you wanted to ask me?

 that's all!

RACHEL:
 ohhhh!! 

 that's not all.

RACHEL:
 oh sure it is!

 oh no, it isn't! no! i think barry is seeing someone in the city.

RACHEL:
 um, what- what would make you think that?

 well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like chanel.

RACHEL:
  was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.

 oh god! you see, that's what i was afraid of!

RACHEL:
 what? what's what you were afraid of?

 okay, okay... when barry was engaged to you, he and i...kind of... had a little thing on the side.

RACHEL:
 what?

 i know. i know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to rachel," and now i feel so stupid.

RACHEL:
 uh... oh, mindy, you are so stupid. oh, we are both so stupid.

 what do you mean?

RACHEL:
 

 oh no.

RACHEL:
 oh, i am so sorry.

 no me, i am so sorry...

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 i tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

JOEY:
 hey, so listen, i went across the street and talked to the doorman- i got the peeper's name! can i use the phone?

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

MONICA:

MONICA:
  

RACHEL:

 sure, sure. come on... 

 hello, sweetheart.

 uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?

RACHEL:
 uh, we are here to break up with you.

 both of you?

 basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.

 i'm sorry... i'm sorry, god, i am so sorry, i'm an idiot, i was weak, i couldn't help myself! whatever i did, i only did because i love you so much!

RACHEL:
 uh- which one of us are you talking to there, barr?

 ....mindy. mindy, of course mindy, it was always mindy.

RACHEL:
 even when we were having sex in that chair?

 

RACHEL:
 please! during that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!

 

RACHEL:
 well, the first time didn't really count... i mean, y'know, 's'barry.

 okay...

  start all over again. we'll go back to aruba.

  here...jason costalano is choking on his retainer.

 oh god...  please, please don't go anywhere, okay? i'll be, i'll be right back. 

RACHEL:
 okay. okay, we'll be here! hating you! did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? listen honey, if i'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because i'm telling you, this feels great.

 yeah... i'm pretty sure i'm still gonna marry him.

RACHEL:
 what are you talking about?! mindy, the guy is the devil! he's satan in a smock!

 look, i know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, i still really wanna be mrs. dr. barry farber, d.d.s.

RACHEL:
 oh god. 

 i hope you can find some way to be happy for me. and i hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?

RACHEL:
 and i hope barry doesn't kill you and eat you in aruba. 

MONICA:
 you okay?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 really?

RACHEL:
 yeah! y'know, ever since i ran out on barry at the wedding, i have wondered whether i made the right choice. and now i know.

MONICA:
 aww...  

JOEY:
 big day. closing credits 

JOEY:
 all right, i'll give you this, mr. peanut is a better dresser. i mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...

PHOEBE:
 you know he's gay?

ROSS:
 i just wanna clarify this: are you outing mr. peanut?

 

CHANDLER:
 danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody.

 hi. hi.

CHANDLER:
 what are you doing here?

 well, i've been calling you, but it turns out i had your number wrong. and when i finally got the right one from information, there was no answer. so i thought i'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.

CHANDLER:
 ...i'm, i'm okay.

 listen uh, maybe we could get together later?

CHANDLER:
 that sounds good. i'll call you- or you call me, whatever...

 you got it.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

 g'bye, everybody.

 bye.

PHOEBE:
 whoo-hoo!

MONICA:
 yeah, there you go!

ROSS:
 second date!

CHANDLER:
 ...i dunno.

RACHEL:
 you don't know?!

JOEY:
 how could someone get a hold of your credit card number?

MONICA:
 i have no idea. but look how much they spent!

RACHEL:
 monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.

MONICA:
 i know. it's just such reckless spending.

ROSS:
 i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.

CHANDLER:
 wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.

MONICA:
 that's me.

PHOEBE:
 oh! the yuk! ross, he's doing it again!  

ROSS:
 marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back- 

RACHEL:
 oh no, not in my room! i'll get him.

MONICA:
 ross, you've got to do something about the humping.

ROSS:
 what? it's, it's just a phase.

CHANDLER:
 well, that's what we said about joey...

ROSS:
 would you all relax? it's not that big a deal.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 let's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious. opening credits  

RACHEL:
 oh, monica. you are not still going over that thing.

MONICA:
 this woman's living my life.

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! look at this, look. she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see. she, she buys clothes from stores that i'm intimidated by the sales people. she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.

RACHEL:
 you're not an artist.

MONICA:
 yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't.

RACHEL:
 oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things.

MONICA:
 oh really? okay, let's compare, shall we.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother. 

CHANDLER:
 how about joey... pepponi?

JOEY:
 no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.

CHANDLER:
 joey... switzerland? 

JOEY:
 plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big. 

CHANDLER:
 joe...joe...joe...stalin?

JOEY:
 stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.

CHANDLER:
 well, it does not ring a bell with me...

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 might wanna try joseph. 

JOEY:
 joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that!

CHANDLER:
 oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof. 

RACHEL:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hi.  taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were.

PHOEBE:
 what are you doing?

MONICA:
  class.

RACHEL:
 what, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?

MONICA:
 this woman's got my life, i should get to see who she is.

RACHEL:
 go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up! ...okay, monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! i mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.

PHOEBE:
 this is madness. it's madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, don't do it!! ...thank you. 

MONICA:
 what d'you think?

PHOEBE:
 lotsa things. 

RACHEL:
 which one do you think she is? 

 may i help you?

MONICA:
 oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.

 you don't observe a dance class. you dance a dance class. spare shoes are over there.

RACHEL:
 what does she mean?

PHOEBE:
 i think she means  

MONICA:
 okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?

  containers lying around after class. let's not have that happen again!

RACHEL:
 she could be you. 

 let's get started. five, six, a-five six seven eight... 

MONICA:
 okay, i'm not getting this!

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? 

RACHEL:
 what? you just click when they click.

 alright people, now everyone grab a partner. 

PHOEBE:
 okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. i'm with rachel.

MONICA:
 great. it's gym class all over again.

 aww.

 well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.

MONICA:
 why don't i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.  

 it's okay, it's okay, i'm here, i'm here. sorry i'm late, okay, here i am. who's the new tense girl?

 she's your partner.

 hi. i'm monica.

MONICA:
 oh. monica! ...hi. i'm mo- ...nana.

 

MONICA:
 yeah. it's dutch.

 you're kidding! i-i spent three years in amsterdam.  

MONICA:
 um, pennsylvania dutch.

 and we're dancing. a-five, six, seven, eight... 

ROSS:
 

 hey.

JOEY:
 where've you been?

ROSS:
 at the vet.

CHANDLER:
 she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?

ROSS:
 she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he's reached sexual maturity.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.

CHANDLER:
 so what does this mean?

ROSS:
 i'm gonna have to give him up. commercial break  

JOEY:
 i can't believe it, ross. this sucks!

CHANDLER:
 i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?

ROSS:
 i know. i know. i mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg.

JOEY:
 isn't there any way you can keep him?

ROSS:
 no, no. the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. i've just gotta get him into a zoo.

JOEY:
 how do you get a monkey into a zoo?

CHANDLER:
 i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen.

ROSS:
 well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo. 

PHOEBE:
 hey. we found her, we found the girl.

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 did you call the cops?

RACHEL:
 nope. we took her to lunch.

CHANDLER:
 ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.

ROSS:
 what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she's a stealer.

MONICA:
 y'know what? after you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.

ROSS:
 yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.

CHANDLER:
 ...take off their hats!

PHOEBE:
 popes in a volkswagen! ...i love that joke. 

RACHEL:
 no way. no way did you do this.

 monana was very brave.

MONICA:
 it was so wild. we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen. only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!

 so once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...

MONICA:
 ...they threw us out! i was thrown out of a hotel! me!

RACHEL:
 go monana! well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up. 

 oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show.

MONICA:
 'scuse me?

 there's an open call for cats. i'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say?

MONICA:
 nononononono. think who you're dealing with here. i mean, i'm not like you. i-i can't even stand in front of a tap class.

 well, that's just probably 'cause of your amish background.

MONICA:
 what?

 well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right?

MONICA:
 right. till i bought a blow dryer, then i was shunned.

 i-i used to be just like you. and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life. did you ever see dead poets' society?

MONICA:
 uh-huh.

 i thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? what was that?! it's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, 'now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back.' and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do.

MONICA:
 wow. then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire. 

ROSS:
   that was like our safety zoo. they take like dogs and cows. see? i don't know who this is harder on, me or him.

PHOEBE:
 i'd say that chair's taking the brunt.

ROSS:
 marcel! marcel! marcel, no! good boy. see, how can nobody want him?

RACHEL:
 oh, somebody will.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 you're kidding.

JOEY:
 apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that!

CHANDLER:
 y'know, you'd think i would've.

JOEY:
 phoebe. whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?

PHOEBE:
 ...flame boy. 

ROSS:
 where exactly is your zoo?

 well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel?

ROSS:
 yes.

 does he, uh, fight with other animals?

ROSS:
 no-no, he's, he's very docile.

 even if he were... cornered?

ROSS:
 well i, i don't know. why?

 uh, how is he at handling small objects?

ROSS:
 he can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...

 how about a hammer, or a small blade?

ROSS:
 why- why- why would he need a blade?

 well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. otherwise it's just cruel. 

 he- he- he got in, he- he got in to san diego.

JOEY:
 we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...

CHANDLER:
 ...he's in.

ROSS:
 he's in! oh, did you hear that, marcel? san diego. san diego!

 you're making a big mistake here. i mean, san diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, i'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.  magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. monica bursts in, 

MONICA:
 yo- hooo!

RACHEL:
 where the hell've you been?

MONICA:
 monica and i just crashed an embassy party.

RACHEL:
 are you drunk?!

MONICA:
 noooo! 

RACHEL:
 oh god, oh. great, monica, y'know what, you could've called, i have been up here, i've been worried... 

RACHEL:
 monica? monica!

MONICA:
 water rules!

RACHEL:
 yes, yes, it does. okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?

MONICA:
 nope. going to the big apple circus today.

RACHEL:
 okay monica, what are you doing? you're gonna lose your job! this is not you!

MONICA:
 no, it is me! y'know, i'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! y'know, when i'm with her, i am so much more than that. i'm- i'm monana! 

RACHEL:
 hello? yes, she is, hold on a second, please. monana, it's for you, the credit card people.

MONICA:
 helloooo? yeah. oh my god. thanks.

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 they've arrested monica. 

MONICA:
 hi.

 hey.

MONICA:
 how are you?

 i'm not too bad. fortunately, blue's my colour. how-how did you know i was here?

MONICA:
 because... i'm monica geller. it was my credit card you were using.

 that i was not expecting.

MONICA:
 i want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.

 oh. thanks.

MONICA:
 no, thank you! you have given me so much! i mean, if it wasn't for you, i would never have gotten to sing memories on the stage at the wintergarden theater!

 well, actually, you only got to sing 'memo-'.

MONICA:
 i just can't believe you're in here. i mean, what am i gonna do without you? who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? who's gonna take me to the big apple circus?

 monica, i started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus?

MONICA:
 well, not... worried, just... wondering.

 there's nothing to wonder about, monica. you're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.

MONICA:
 not necessarily...

 yes necessarily! i mean, i dunno what it is, maybe it's the amish thing.

MONICA:
 um, i'm not actually amish.

 really? then why are you like that? 

 you by the door. in or out?

MONICA:
 in. 

 you in the back, you're getting it all wrong!

MONICA:
 yeah, but at least i'm doing it! 

 this is the final boarding call for flight 67 to san diego, boarding at gate 42a.

PHOEBE:
 okay. good-bye, little monkey guy. alright, i wrote you this poem. okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 marcel, i'm hungry.

ROSS:
 that was good.

RACHEL:
  y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.

ROSS:
 uh, if you guys don't mind, i'd like to take a moment, just me and him.

 oh, sure. sure, absolutely.  

ROSS:
 marcel, c'mere, c'mere.   well buddy, this is it. there's just a coupla things i want to say. i'm really gonna miss you, and i'm never gonna forget about you. you've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! marcel, would- okay, just take him away. just take him.  closing credits

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused. 

PHOEBE:
 i could be a secretary.

CHANDLER:
 well, you know phoebs. i don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day.

PHOEBE:
 i could do that. 

RACHEL:
 what are you playing with?

ROSS:
 oh, it's my new beeper.

JOEY:
 what the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?

MONICA:
 is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'help, come quick, they're still extinct.'

ROSS:
 no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 okay, is this like 'i have an early class tomorrow' or 'i'm secretly married to a goat?'

 well it's somewhere in between. you see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, i'm not uh..., well i, i mean i haven't ever uh...

MONICA:

 you know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. 

MONICA:

 oh.

MONICA:

MONICA:
 now, mom, everything's going fine, really.  great. he's uh, he's in a whole other place.  don't have to fly back, really.    cry. chandler takes the phone, makes a noise in it resembling static, and hangs up. joey 

CHANDLER:
 where have you been?

JOEY:
 oh, just had a baby.

CHANDLER:
 mazel tov! 

 i don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. so, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?

RACHEL:
 

 no, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.

RACHEL:
 right, yeah, i've heard that about cute doctors.

 no, no, really. i suppose it's because i spend so much time, you know, where i do.

RACHEL:
 oh.

 i try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what i do. it's like uh...well, for instance, what do you do?

RACHEL:
 i'm a waitress.

 ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if i see one more cup of coffee'...

RACHEL:
 

 i'm gonna go check up on your friend.

RACHEL:
 ok. that's fine.   balloons, but before he enters he sees that the baby's father has arrived. he listens at 

 so how did you know i was even here?

 your mom called me. so is this her?

 no, this is a loaner.

 i'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.

 i wasn't by myself. i had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.   so, did you see who won the game?

 yeah, the knicks by 10. they suck.

 yeah, they're not so bad.    

ROSS:
 come on, come on. damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  your fault. this is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? my son is being born, and i should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.

 the woman i love is having a baby today. i've been waiting for this just as much as you have.

ROSS:
 no no no, believe me. no one has been waiting for this as much as i have, ok? and you know what the funny thing is? when this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? where does that leave me?

 you get to be the baby's father. everyone knows who you are. who am i? there's mother's day, there's father's day, there's no... lesbian lover day.

ROSS:
 every day is lesbian lover day.

PHOEBE:
 this is so great.

ROSS:
 you wanna explain that?

PHOEBE:
 i mean, well, 'cause when i was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. and here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. and it's not even born yet. it's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  sorry, you were fighting.  

 where are they?

MONICA:
 i'm sure they'll be here soon.

RACHEL:
 yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.

JOEY:
 relax. you're only at nine centimeters. and the baby's at zero station.

CHANDLER:
  

CHANDLER:
 somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.   uh, that's great. 

 all right, ten centimeters, here we go.

 all right, honey, time to start pushing.

 but they're not here yet!

 i'm sorry, i can't tell the baby to wait for them.

 oh, god.  

ROSS:
 ok, got the vent open.

PHOEBE:
  ben. it's ben... to the rescue!

ROSS:
 ben, you ready? all right, gimme your foot. ok, on three, ben. one, two, three. ok, that's it, ben. 

 what do you see?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 yeah, i-it's for the museum. someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so i'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. anyway, i'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. so here's my itinerary

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 uh, let's see... alvin... simon... theodore.... no.

ROSS:
 well, rachel's having drinks with him tonight.

JOEY:
 oh no! how can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?

CHANDLER:
 forget about her.

JOEY:
 he's right, man. please. move on. go to china. eat chinese food.

CHANDLER:
 course there, they just call it food.

ROSS:
 yeah... i guess. i don'ti don't know. alright, just... just give her this for me, ok? 

JOEY:
 listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.

ROSS:
 i know.

JOEY:
 we want you to be happy. and i may only have a couple beers in me, but... i love you, man. 

CHANDLER:
 i'm still on my first. i just think you're nice.  

 anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. we call ourselves 'the three basketeers.'

JOEY:
 like the three musketeers, only with fruit.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, no, no, no. presents first. food later.  

MONICA:
 hey, hold on there, tiger. how's it going? how you holding up?

JOEY:
 well, not so good. she definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what i... 

JOEY:
 then you do. heh, heh.

MONICA:
 so, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?

JOEY:
 what do you mean?

MONICA:
 y'know, just be there for her. 

JOEY:
 not following you.

MONICA:
 think about it.  

RACHEL:
 ok, i'm guessing this is from... 

RACHEL:
 well, thank you, melanie.

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
  it's...  

RACHEL:
 this one's from joey... feels like a book. thinks it's a book... feels like a book. and...

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's dr. seuss!

JOEY:
 

 there is a little child inside this man!

CHANDLER:
 yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. 

RACHEL:
 who's this from?

CHANDLER:
 oh, that's ross's. 

RACHEL:
 oh... 

PHOEBE:
 remembered what?

RACHEL:
 it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can't believe he remembered!

CHANDLER:
 well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?  

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune.

MONICA:
 i can't believe he did this.

CHANDLER:
 come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?  

RACHEL:
 what did you just say?

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 oh.... my god.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
  that'll turn back time. commercial break 

RACHEL:
 i mean, this is unbelievable.

PHOEBE:
 i know. this is really, really huge.

CHANDLER:
 no it's not. it's small. it's tiny. it's petite. it's wee.

PHOEBE:
 nuh-uh. i don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.

CHANDLER:
 ok, is there a mute button on this woman?

MONICA:
 i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross! d-did you have any idea?

RACHEL:
 no! none! i mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so i just...  did he say? i mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?

JOEY:
 well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.

RACHEL:
 ross? all this time? well, i've got to talk to him. 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 the country.

MONICA:
 no, no, wait.  another forty-five more minutes.

CHANDLER:
 what about the time difference?

MONICA:
 from here to the airport?

CHANDLER:
 yes! 

MONICA:
 rachel, what're you gonna say to him?

RACHEL:
 i-i-i don't know.

CHANDLER:
 well then maybe you shouldn't go. 

JOEY:
 he's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.

MONICA:
 yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.

RACHEL:
 i don't know. maybe i'll know when i see him.

PHOEBE:
 here, look, alright, does this help? 

RACHEL:
 noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. i mean, this is just too big. y'know, i just, i've just gotta talk to him. i... i gotta... ok, i'll see you later. 

CHANDLER:
 rachel, i love you! deal with me first!   tape. occasionally, he makes an outburst in chinese in accordance with the tape. he is 

ROSS:
 

 alright!

ROSS:
 ni-chou chi-ma!  

RACHEL:
 ross! excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... 

 hi!

RACHEL:
 hi.

 may i see your boarding pass?

RACHEL:
 oh, no, no, i don't have one. i just need to talk to my friend.

 oh, oooh. i'm sorry. you are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.

RACHEL:
 no, i know, but ihe just went on. he's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, i... can i j-just...

 no no no! federal regulations!

RACHEL:
 ok, alright, ok, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? please? this is very important.

 alright. what's the message?

RACHEL:
 uh... i don't know.  

 sir? sir? excuse me, sir? uh... i have a message for you.

 

 it's from rachel. she said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.

  about! there's no rachel! don't give me that deep freeze. 

 mmmmmm... oh, joey, joey, joey... i think i blacked out there for a minute!

JOEY:
 heh, heh. it was nothin'.

 well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!  

JOEY:
  you another turn.

 

JOEY:
 sure! why not?

 boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow. 

 oooh, i gotta tell you... you are nothing like i thought you would be.

JOEY:
 how do you mean?

 i don't know, i-i guess i just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' but you... you're a giver. you're like the most generous man i ever met. i mean... you're practically a woman.  

MONICA:
 uh, so, uh, rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, i mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with ross or should i just throw it out?

RACHEL:
 i don't know. i don't know... i thought about it all the way there, and i thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's ross. y'know what i mean? i mean, it's ross.

 sure.

RACHEL:
 i don't know, i mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but i'm thinking... oh, i'm thinking it'd be really great.

MONICA:
 oh my god, me too! oh! oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! y'know what the best part is? the best part is that you already know everything about him! i mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.

MONICA:
 another good point.

PHOEBE:
 no, i mean, i mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. y'know, it's... you're committed.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 well, i mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?

MONICA:
 why isn't it working out?

RACHEL:
 i don't know... sometimes it doesn't.

MONICA:
 is he not cute enough for you?

RACHEL:
 no!

MONICA:
 does he not make enough money?

RACHEL:
 no, i'm just....

PHOEBE:
 maybe there's someone else.

RACHEL:
 wha...

MONICA:
 is there? is there someone else?

RACHEL:
 no! there is.. there is noone else!

MONICA:
 then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?  

CHANDLER:
 hey, big...

JOEY:
 shhhh!

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 she's still asleep.

CHANDLER:
 so how'd it go?

JOEY:
 oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you're great in bed?

CHANDLER:
 the fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.

JOEY:
 well, it's like, last night, i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. so i had to do all this other stuff. and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!

CHANDLER:
 yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.

JOEY:
 it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind. but all my other senses are heightened, y'know? it's like... i was able to appreciate it on another level.

CHANDLER:
 i didn't know you had another level.

JOEY:
 i know! neither did i!  

MONICA:
 hey, great skirt! birthday present?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 oh, from who?

RACHEL:
 from you. i exchanged the blouse you got me.

MONICA:
 well, it's the thought. hey, doesn't ross's flight get in in a couple hours? at gate 27-b?

RACHEL:
 uh, yeah. uh, monica, y'know, honey, i've been thinking about it and i've decided thisthis whole ross thing, it's just not a good idea.

MONICA:
 oh, why?

RACHEL:
 because, i feel like i wouldn't just be going out with him. i would be going out with all of you. oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and i don't wanna...

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...

MONICA:
 i am not 'so'! ok, i was a teensy bit weird at first, but... i'll be good. i promise. 

RACHEL:
 who is it?

 it's me, carl.

RACHEL:
 c'mon up.

MONICA:
 behind my brother's back?  of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.  

JOEY:
 seven hundred bucks!

CHANDLER:
 alright, you did it! do we have any fruit?

JOEY:
 man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something.

CHANDLER:
 really? so, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?

JOEY:
 what, are you crazy? when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?  

 i'm just sayin', if i see one more picture of ed begley, jr. in that stupid electric car, i'm gonna shoot myself! i mean, don't get me wrong... i'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!  

ROSS:
 i can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.

RACHEL:
 would you excuse me, please? i'm trying to have a date here.

ROSS:
 fine, just stop thinking about me. 

ROSS:
 can't do it, can you?

RACHEL:
 so i'm thinking about you. so what?

ROSS:
 i don't get it. what do you see in this guy, anyway?

RACHEL:
 well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....

 i mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!

ROSS:
 rachel, come on. give us a chance.

RACHEL:
 ross, it's too hard.

ROSS:
 no, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? who cares about them. this is about us. look, i-i've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. 

RACHEL:
 ross, you're like my best friend.

ROSS:
 i know.

RACHEL:
 if we broke up, and i lost you...

ROSS:
 whoa, whoa, whoa. what makes you think we're gonna break up?

RACHEL:
 well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?

ROSS:
  know we are perfect for each other, right? i mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?

RACHEL:
 i don't know... i mean, i've never looked at you that way before.

ROSS:
 well, start looking.  

RACHEL:
 wow.

 exactly! and you just know i'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!

RACHEL:
 right! you're right!

 heh... y'know?

RACHEL:
 you know what?

 what?

RACHEL:
 i forgot... i am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. i am so sorry! i'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....   i meani'm sorry. i-i-i gotta go. i'm sorry.  

 but...  

RACHEL:
  sorry. hi.  

 for god's sake, will you let it go? there's no rachel! 

ROSS:
 oh, hey, hey, i got that. 

 oh, thanks, sweetie.

ROSS:
 no problem. i cannot wait for you to meet my friends.

 really?

ROSS:
 yeah. 

 you don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?

ROSS:
 no, no, they will. i just... uh...

 can't wait.

PHOEBE:
 ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like "forget about her" but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, "oh my god." so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh-oh! so, that's pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been? opening credits  

RACHEL:
 oh my god. oh my god.  move! move! emergency! excuse me! 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, there you are! hi! oh, so, so, how was china, you?  

ROSS:
 it was, it was great. oh, what happened?

RACHEL:
 what?

ROSS:
 you're bleeding. 

RACHEL:
 i am? oh, look at that, yes i am. enough about me, enough about me, mr. back from the orient. come on. i wanna hear everything! everything. 

ROSS:
 well, where do i start? this is julie. julie, this is rachel.

RACHEL:
 these are, these aren't for you.   welcome to our country.

 

RACHEL:
 ok, well, not a problem. we'll just use them to stop the bleeding. ok. baggage claim? ok.  

CHANDLER:
  no way!

MONICA:
 i'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with ross! 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god. this is huge. this is bigger than huge. this is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?

JOEY:
 um, this?

PHOEBE:
 yes.

MONICA:
 guys, you got your hair cut.

CHANDLER:
 yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay.

PHOEBE:
 'cause, you know,  good. i love that voice.

RACHEL:
  around her. cramp, cramp.

CHANDLER:
 ok, i think she's trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs. 

RACHEL:
  you, you slowpokes!

ROSS:
 that's all right, rach, we got the bags. hi, hello. julie, this is my sister monica. this is chandler.  phoebe.  joey, what up?

JOEY:
 what up?!

ROSS:
 everyone, this is julie.

RACHEL:
 

 ohh. 

 hi, but i'm not here, you haven't met me. i'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when i don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.

ROSS:
 and bus.

 oh my god.

ROSS:
  the screaming guy?

  and the spitting?

ROSS:
 you gotta hear this story.

 we're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...

ROSS:
 200 at least.

  ...and this guy...

RACHEL:
 and the chicken pooped in her lap. oh, i'm so sorry. i just gave away the ending, didn't i? oh! it's just, i just heard this story in the cab, and it is all i can think about.

MONICA:
 this is amazing. i mean, how, how did this happen?

 well, ross and i were in grad school together.

ROSS:
 but we haven't seen each other since then. well i land in china, guess who's in charge of the dig. 

RACHEL:
 julie! julie, isn't that great? i mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.

 and then we've gotta get some sleep.

ROSS:
 yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.

CHANDLER:
 well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause i like to be surprised. 

RACHEL:
 bye.  

ROSS:
 hey, rach, can i get some coffee?

RACHEL:
 yeah, sure.

ROSS:
 thank you.

CHANDLER:
 hey, rach, can i get...

RACHEL:
 did you talk to him?

CHANDLER:
 not yet.

RACHEL:
 then, no. 

CHANDLER:
 so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.

ROSS:
 i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. you know whose voice that was?

CHANDLER:
 god?

ROSS:
 it was you, pal.

CHANDLER:
 well, maybe it was god, doing me.

ROSS:
 look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. but then i met julie, and i don't know, we're havin' a great time. and i have to say, i never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.

CHANDLER:
 well, you owe me one, big guy.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i didn't order lemonade.

RACHEL:
 oh. well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. 

ROSS:
 but...

RACHEL:
 go-go-go-go, come on!  uh, what did you find out?

CHANDLER:
 he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. but, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  without any outside help whatsoever.

RACHEL:
 how is that the silver lining?

CHANDLER:
 you have to really wanna see it. 

ROSS:
 ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. 

MONICA:
 pheebes, you know what i'm thinking?

PHOEBE:
 oh, ok. how, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?

MONICA:
 no, although now that's what i'm thinking.

PHOEBE:
 all right, so what were you thinking?

MONICA:
 well, i was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, i thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?

PHOEBE:
 ohh! no.

MONICA:
 why not?

PHOEBE:
 because, i'm just, i'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.

MONICA:
 no you're not.

PHOEBE:
 i know i'm not, but you are, and i was trying to spare your feelings. 

JOEY:
  julie, for you. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 needs some clothes altered?

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 ok, i don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her. 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 i'm still on "no."

RACHEL:
  could close your eyes for just a sec?

JOEY:
 no-no-no-no-no, 

PHOEBE:
 what's goin' on?

RACHEL:
 well, i sorta did a stupid thing last night.

CHANDLER:
 what stupid thing did you do?

 

PHOEBE:
 ewww!  commercial break 

RACHEL:
 ok, paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. 

MONICA:
 rachel, how did this happen?

RACHEL:
 i don't know, i just kinda ran into him last night.

PHOEBE:
 where?

RACHEL:
 at his apartment. is this juice?

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe?

RACHEL:
 oh god, i know i'm a pathetic loser.

MONICA:
 honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.

CHANDLER:
 people do stupid things when they're upset.

MONICA:
 my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn't... , but this is about your horrible mistake. 

 hi!

ROSS:
 hi. sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.

 

ROSS:
 hey, paulo. what are you doing here?

 i do raquel.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah, he's back. is that a problem?

ROSS:
 no, not a problem.

RACHEL:
 good! i'm glad it's not a problem.

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, i've got pants that need to be altered.

JOEY:
 hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello. he'll know what it means.

CHANDLER:
 are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?

MONICA:
  was so much shorter and cuter.

PHOEBE:
 all right. ok, but, but!  you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and monica about it.

MONICA:
 i promise.

PHOEBE:
 all right.  cut, and some of you aren't. but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing. 

PHOEBE:
 all right, that's it, i quit.

MONICA:
 what? i didn't say anything.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but this  trusts a person. ok, this  doesn't trust a person.

MONICA:
 i'm sorry. i'm sorry, phoebe. it's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.

PHOEBE:
 would you relax? i know what i am doing. this is how he wears it.

MONICA:
 how who wears it?

PHOEBE:
 demi moore.

MONICA:
 demi moore is not a he.

PHOEBE:
 well, he was a he in arthur, and in ten.

MONICA:
 that's dudley moore. i said i wanted it like demi moore.

PHOEBE:
 oh.  oh!

MONICA:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!

MONICA:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! i'm sorry, i'm sorry. which one's demi moore?

MONICA:
 she's the actress that was in disclosure, indecent proposal, ghost!

PHOEBE:
 oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

MONICA:
 i know! 

 how long do you want the cuffs?

CHANDLER:
 at least as long as i have the pants. 

 i just got that. ok, now we'll do your inseam.   

RACHEL:
 how is she?

PHOEBE:
 it's too soon to tell. she's resting, which is a good sign.

ROSS:
 how's the hair?

PHOEBE:
 i'm not gonna lie to you, ross, it doesn't look good. i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.

JOEY:
 can we see her?

PHOEBE:
 your hair looks too good, i think it would upset her. ross, why don't you come on in. 

ROSS:
  yeah.   

JOEY:
 how're you doing?

RACHEL:
 i'm okay.

JOEY:
 ooh, that bad, huh? 

RACHEL:
 what?

JOEY:
 look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. it's one of my gifts.

RACHEL:
 when i saw him get off that plane with her, i really thought i hit rock bottom. but today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.

JOEY:
 you gotta tell ross how you feel.

RACHEL:
 come on. how can i just tell him? what about julie?

JOEY:
 what about her? they've only been going out for two weeks. ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.

RACHEL:
 i don't know, i don't know.

JOEY:
 look, rach, rach! i've been with my share of women. in fact, i've been with like a lot of people's share of women. the point is, i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you.

CHANDLER:
  your tailor is a very bad man!

JOEY:
 frankie? what're you talking about?

ROSS:
  

CHANDLER:
 joey's tailor...took advantage of me.

ROSS:
 what?

JOEY:
 no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years.

CHANDLER:
 oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...

ROSS:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 cupping.

JOEY:
 that's how they do pants! first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.   what? ross, ross, would you tell him? isn't that how they measure pants?

ROSS:
 yes, yes it is. in prison! whatsa matter with you?

JOEY:
 what? that's not?  

MONICA:
 even mary tyler moore would've been better.

ROSS:
 i like it. i do, i think it's a ten. 

MONICA:
 thank you. my hair is very amused.

CHANDLER:
 come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it's crazy, but it's true.

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 well, i gotta go. bye. bye, rach.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 yeah, that's kinda what i meant by "bye!"

RACHEL:
 well, can i talk to you for a sec? 

ROSS:
 okay. 

JOEY:
 hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...

CHANDLER:
 that's ok. 

ROSS:
 what's goin' on?

RACHEL:
 well, first of all, paulo and i are not back together. it was just a stupid thing i did, and if i could go back in time and do it again, well, i wouldn't. um, second of all 

ROSS:
 ok. well, before i say anything, i just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then i tell you what i think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and i look like a complete idiot?

RACHEL:
 no. no-no-no-no.

ROSS:
 well, then, i think, i think the guy is scum. i hate him. i mean i actuallyi-i physically hate him. i always have. you are way too good to be with a guy like that. 

RACHEL:
 really?

ROSS:
 you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? someone who wakes up every morning thinking "oh my god, i'm with rachel". you know, someone who makes you feel good, the way i am with julie.   was there a second of all?

RACHEL:
 no, i think that was the whole all.

ROSS:
 okay.  okay.  

JOEY:
 i swear to god, dad. that's not how they measure pants. closing credits 

 i was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like andie mcdowell's new haircut?

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah!  oh, i can do that.

 really?

PHOEBE:
 you wanna do it right now?

 great! 

PHOEBE:
  the girl from four weddings and a funeral, right?

RACHEL:
 no. no no no no no. that's rodney mcdowell. andie mcdowell is the guy from planet of the apes.

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah. ok, thank you.

MONICA:
  unbelievably expensive, and i know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but i couldn't resist. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, look at these! hey, ben. just do it.  oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?

 oh, is he hungry already?

 i guess so. 

CHANDLER:
 you know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. i'll be right back. 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 we're just hanging out by the spoons. ladle?

ROSS:
 look, would you guys grow up? that is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.

JOEY:
 yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.

ROSS:
 this is my son having lunch, ok? it's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. carol's fine with it, now come on. 

ROSS:
 carol?

CHANDLER:
 carol? i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?

 sure.

JOEY:
 uh, does it hurt?

 it did at first, but not anymore.

JOEY:
 chandler?

CHANDLER:
 so, uh, how often can you do it?

 as much as he needs.

JOEY:
 ok, i got one, i got one. uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? opening credits 

 rachel, do you have any muffins left?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i forget which ones.

 oh, you're busy, that's ok, i'll get it. anybody else want one? 

 no thanks.

  go. 

RACHEL:
 

 oh, listen you guys. i have this friend at bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. so, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey, sweetums.

ROSS:
 hello to the rest.

  hi!

JOEY:

MONICA:
 it's gonna be a problem, isn't it?

CHANDLER:
 come on, you're going to bloomingdale's with julie? that's like cheating on rachel in her house of worship.

MONICA:
 but i'm...

PHOEBE:
 monica, she will kill you. she will kill you like a dog in the street.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.

ROSS:
 it's a big deal to me. this is great, monica. i really appreciate this.

MONICA:
 you're welcome.

PHOEBE:
 woof, woof.  

JOEY:
   annabelle.

 hey, joey. so did you hear about the new guy?

JOEY:

 nobody knows his name. me and the girls just call him the hombre man. 

  

JOEY:

JOEY:
 well, he's gonna. i'll see you a little later, ok?  hey, how ya doin'?

JOEY:

JOEY:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 we were shopping, and we had lunch.

PHOEBE:
 oh, all right. what did i have?

MONICA:
 you had a salad.

PHOEBE:
 oh, no wonder i don't feel full.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 i went shopping with monica all day, and i had a salad.

RACHEL:
 good, pheebs. what'd you buy?

PHOEBE:
 um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.

RACHEL:
 you went shopping for fur?

PHOEBE:
 yes, and then i realized i'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, 

RACHEL:
 you bought boobs?

PHOEBE:
  bras.  

JOEY:
  for...  listen, i was wondering if maybe after work you and i could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.

 oh, actually i sorta have plans.

 

 you bet. 

JOEY:
  spraying cologne.   bijan for men?!  

 ok, and this is funny clown. funny clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.

ROSS:
 carol, we've been through this before, ok? we have a good time. we laugh, we play. it's like we're father and son.

 honey, relax. ross is great with him.  surprised. i'm a lovely person.

RACHEL:
 oh, this is so cute.

 oh, i got that for him.

ROSS:
 my mommies love me. that's clever.

MONICA:
 hello? oh, hi, ju   that'd be great. see ya then. bye. 

RACHEL:
 did you just say hi, jew?

MONICA:
 yes. uh, yes, i did. that was my friend, eddie moskowitz. yeah, he likes it. reaffirms his faith.  

PHOEBE:
 ben, dinner!

ROSS:
 thanks aunt pheebs. hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.

PHOEBE:
 duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. ok.  

CHANDLER:
 what did you just do?

PHOEBE:
 i licked my arm, what?

ROSS:
 it's breast milk.

PHOEBE:
 so?

RACHEL:
 phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.

JOEY:
 what is the big deal? 

CHANDLER:
 what did you just do?

ROSS:
 ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?

PHOEBE:
 you won't even taste it?

ROSS:
 no!

PHOEBE:
 not even if you just pretend that it's milk?

ROSS:
 not even if carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.  

MONICA:
 hey, where is everybody?

RACHEL:
 they took ben to the park. where've you been?

MONICA:
 just out. had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. thanks for your jacket.

RACHEL:
 oh, no problem. you can borrow it, by the way.   here are your keys, hon.  

MONICA:
 okay.

RACHEL:
 mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?

MONICA:
 you know what probably happened? someone musta stolen my credit card.

RACHEL:
 and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?

MONICA:
 that is an excellent excellent question. that is excellent.

RACHEL:
 monica, what is with you? who'd you have lunch with?

MONICA:
 judy.

RACHEL:
 who?

MONICA:
 julie.

RACHEL:
 what?!

MONICA:
 jody!

RACHEL:
 you were with julie?

MONICA:
 look, when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. and then, one thing led to another and, before i knew it, we were...shopping.

RACHEL:
 oh. oh my god. 

MONICA:
 honey, wait. we only did it once. it didn't mean anything to me.

RACHEL:
 yeah, right.  sure!

MONICA:
 really, rachel, i was thinking of you the whole time. look, i'm sorry, all right. i never meant for you to find out!

RACHEL:
 oh, please, you wanted to get caught. 

MONICA:
 that is not true!

RACHEL:
 oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?

MONICA:
 did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid?

RACHEL:
 ok, monica. i just have to know one thing. did you go with her to bloomingdale's?  you right now.  commercial break  

MONICA:
  it's monica.  simple as all that, ok?  

 hey! 

 how did we do?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i tasted ben's milk, and ross freaked out.

ROSS:
 i did not freak out. 

 why'd you freak out?

ROSS:
 because it's breast milk. it's gross.

 my breast milk is gross?

 this should be fun.

ROSS:
 no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults.

CHANDLER:
 of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.

 ross, you're being silly. i've tried it, it's no big deal. just taste it. 

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 come on. it doesn't taste bad.

JOEY:
 yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...

 cantaloupe juice.

JOEY:
 exactly.

ROSS:
 

 uh huh.

ROSS:
 oh, you've tasted it.

 you can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.

ROSS:
   gimme the towel.     

CHANDLER:
 howdy.

JOEY:
  juice. well, they switched me over to hombre.

CHANDLER:
 well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.

JOEY:
 or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  through two bottles a day.

CHANDLER:
  care? you're an actor. this is your day job. this isn't supposed to mean anything to you.

JOEY:
 i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best.   i don't know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.

CHANDLER:
  you know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where're you gonna run?

JOEY:
 yeah i guess you're right.

CHANDLER:
 you're damn right i'm right. i say you show this guy what you're made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.

JOEY:
 i'm gonna do it. 

CHANDLER:
 all right. now go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. 

MONICA:
 i don't know what else to say.

RACHEL:
 well that works out good, because i'm not listening.

MONICA:
 i feel terrible, i really do.

RACHEL:
 oh, i'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?

MONICA:
 rachel,  some time together. is that so terrible?

RACHEL:
 yes.

MONICA:
 it's that terrible?

RACHEL:
 yes. monica, you don't get it. it's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually 

MONICA:
 me? what are you talking about? nobody could steal me from you. i mean, just because i'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. i mean, 

RACHEL:
 i love you too. 

PHOEBE:
 you guys, um i know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um i love you guys too.  

MONICA:
 look, i know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. i mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. i really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. would you just give that a chance, for me?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 wait, wait, wait, wait!   

JOEY:
 mornin'. 

 i heard ya.

 all right, everybody, i'm openin' the doors. you boys ready?

 ready.

JOEY:
 yeah, i'm ready.  as the store guy slowly lets in the first customer while joey and the hombre man get ready to draw.  in slow motion they spot the customer, eye each other, draw, and as the customer walks into the middle joey's bottle misfires but the hombre man spays it into the 

 you idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, i'm suing!

 oh my god, todd! what the hell did you do?

 i'm sorry. i am such a doofus. i'm so sorry, i'm so sorry.

 

JOEY:
 these new kids, they never last. sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now?

 sure.  

 so.

RACHEL:
 so. i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. i mean, you know, we've never really talked. i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?

 i know, i probably shouldn't even tell you this, but i'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.

RACHEL:
 really? me?

 yes. oh my god, are you kidding? ross is so crazy about you, and i really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.

RACHEL:
 well, you're not totally paranoid.

 oy.

RACHEL:
 um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which i'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, i just, i see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god i hate it when she's right.

 thanks. hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?

RACHEL:
 yeah, that'd be great. i'd love it.

 i'd love it too. shoot, i gotta go. so, i'll talk to you later.

RACHEL:
 all right, julie.

 bye. 

RACHEL:
 bye.  closing credits  its between ross, a plate of cookies, and the breast milk.  they've been eyeing each other for a while now, and chandler and joey are getting bored.  he checks his ross and in frustration, shoves his watch in front of ross's eyes as if saying, "hurry it up already!"  finally, ross scratches his head, does that again, itches his nose, scratches his head, grabs the bottle, takes a big swig, and piles several cookies 

RACHEL:
 mom, would you relax. that was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, i would never do that. mom, c'mon, stop worrying. this is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing   oh my goood, oh my god, oh i gotta go, i gotta go, i gotta go.  that's fine, you just read the paper, i'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you.   ok, that's fine, read the family circus, enjoy the gentle comedy.   aaahh, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, aaaaahh.    

 hi. 

RACHEL:
 hi, hi can i help you? 

 yeah, i'm looking for phoebe, does she still live here? 

RACHEL:
 uh, no she doesn't but i can, i can get a message to her. 

 great. uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.  

RACHEL:
 what?  

 hey, how, how did you do that?  opening titles   

JOEY:
 this is unbelievable phoebs, how can you be married? 

PHOEBE:
 well, i mean, i'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from canada and he just needed a green card. 

MONICA:
 i can't believe you married duncan. i mean how could you not tell me? we lived together, we told each other everything. 

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry monica but i knew if i told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve. 

MONICA:
 of course i wouldn't approve, i mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. i mean, what the hell were you thinking? 

ROSS:
 you see, and you thought she'd be judgemental. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, i wasn't in love with him and i was just helping out a friend. 

MONICA:
 please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and i saw you eat a cheeseburger. 

 huuh. 

MONICA:
 well, didn't you? 

PHOEBE:
 i might have. 

MONICA:
 i can't believe you didn't tell me. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything. 

MONICA:
 what have i not told you? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i don't know. umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby out on the terrace. 

RACHEL:
 what! 

MONICA:
 wait a minute, who told you?  dead meat. 

CHANDLER:
 i didn't know it was a big secret. 

MONICA:
 oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh i don't know, having a third nipple. 

PHOEBE:
 you have a third nipple? 

CHANDLER:
 you bitch. 

ROSS:
 whip it out, whip it out. 

CHANDLER:
 c'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless. 

RACHEL:
 oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples? 

JOEY:
 i can't believe you. you told me it was a nubbin. 

ROSS:
 joey, what did you think a nubbin was? 

JOEY:
 i don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, i thought that's what it was. let me see it again. 

 yeah, show it. show it. the nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin. 

CHANDLER:
 joey was in a porno movie. 

 huuh. 

CHANDLER:
 if i'm goin' down, i'm takin' everybody with me. 

ROSS:
 you were in a porno? 

JOEY:
 ahh, alright, alright, alright, i was young and i just wanted a job, ok. but at the last minute i couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it. 

MONICA:
 that is wild. 

ROSS:
  

PHOEBE:
 yeah, is there a hair on it? 

JOEY:
 what happens if you flick it?   

ROSS:
 so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? 

CHANDLER:
 why yes ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of narnia. 

 you know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. you get the best huts and women dance naked around you. 

CHANDLER:
 huh? are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? 

ROSS:
 you know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know? 

RACHEL:
  

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 what's wrong with people having sex? 

RACHEL:
 well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. and uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. and, monica help me out here. 

MONICA:
 hell, i wanna see joey.   

 so is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind. 

CHANDLER:
 ok, now wait a minute. that is the craziest typing test i've ever seen. 

MONICA:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 shh, ok, here i come, here i come. see i'm comin' to fix the copier, i can't get to the copier, i'm thinkin' what do i do, what do i do. . . so i just watch 'em have sex. and then i say, wait, here's my line,  tray.

PHOEBE:

 oh, yeah, um, alright, i kinda need a divorce. 

PHOEBE:
 ohh. . .k. how come? 

 umm, actually, i'm getting married again. 

PHOEBE:
 what? 

 oh god, i don't know how to tell you this. i'm straight. 

PHOEBE:
 huuh. 

 yeah, i know, i. 

PHOEBE:
 i, i don't, i don't understand, how can you be straight? i mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great academy award parties. 

 i know, that's what i kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore. 

PHOEBE:
 so how long have you known? 

 well i guess on some level i always knew i was straight. i though i was supposed to be something else, you know, i'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, i was just tryin' to fit in. 

PHOEBE:
 and um, and there's actually a, a woman? 

 her name's debra. 

PHOEBE:
 oh. well is she, is she the first that you've been with? 

 well, i've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when i'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. but i, i, i told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.  

PHOEBE:
 sure. 

 but now i know i don't have a choice about this, i was born this way. 

PHOEBE:
 i, i don't know what to say. i mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'oh, i'm not gay.' 

 i'm, i'm still me. 

PHOEBE:
 why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?   

MONICA:
 you know, it still smells like monkey in there. 

 that saves us a conversation. 

CHANDLER:
 well, listen, this has been great but i'm officially wiped. 

JOEY:
 me too, we should get goin'. 

RACHEL:
 no, no, i mean, no, c'mon you guys, i mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore. 

MONICA:
 rachel, that's all we do. 

RACHEL:
 maybe that's all we do, what about julie? 

 what about julie? 

RACHEL:
 well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. i mean, who is julie? i mean, what do you like, what don't you like? we wanna hear everything. 

 well, that could take a while. 

RACHEL:
 so. i mean, who here does not have the time to get to know julie? 

CHANDLER:
 i got the time to get to know julie. 

JOEY:
 i got time. 

MONICA:
 rach, i know her pretty well, can i go?  fine. 

RACHEL:
 ok julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like? 

 well, in a nutshell. . . 

RACHEL:
 nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.    

PHOEBE:
 so, um, have you told your parents? 

 no, but it'll be ok, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . . 

PHOEBE:
  question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, i had been around, do you think that i would have been the one who. . . no, um, i'm sorry, don't tell me, i don't th ink either answer would make me feel better. 

 i love you phoebe.  

PHOEBE:
 so your brother's straigh huh? seriously.   

 and my second grade teacher was ms. thomas, and my first grade teacher was mrs. cobb. 

 mrs., mrs. gobb? 

 no cobb, as in cobb salad. 

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 i'm goin' home. 

RACHEL:
 what?   

JOEY:
 boy that julie's a talker, huh? 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 so, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . . 

ROSS:
 oh, no no, i am. 

RACHEL:
 oh, well, are hey, are you nervous? 

ROSS:
 um, no, i uh, i have done it before. 

RACHEL:
 uh, ok, i mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. i mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce? 

ROSS:
 i uh, i don't know, i guess i'm just gonna see, see what happens. 

 ok, gook luck. 

ROSS:
 wha, uhh, what? 

RACHEL:
 nothing, i mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. 

ROSS:
 ok, now i'm nervous. 

RACHEL:
 maybe you should put it off. 

ROSS:
 no, no, i don't wanna put it off, i just, god i just, i spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now i'm actually happy. you know, i mean, really happy. i just, i just don't wanna, i don't wanna mess it up, ya know. 

RACHEL:
 i know, yeah, sorry. 

ROSS:
 what, it's not your fault. 

RACHEL:
 maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. i mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. i mean, women really like that. 

ROSS:
 really? 

RACHEL:
 yeah, i mean, you know it, i mean, if it were me i, i, you know, i'd want you to, i don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. 

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 and then, i don't know, i mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that i'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. and, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. 

ROSS:
 ohh. . . thanks rach, goodnight.  

RACHEL:
 ohh, god.  closing credits     

ROSS:
 good morning. 

 well, somebody got some last night. 

ROSS:
 man, i sure miss julie.

CHANDLER:
 spanish midgets. spanish midgets wrestling. julie. ok, yes, i see how you got there. 

ROSS:
 you ever figure out what that thing's for?

CHANDLER:
 no, see, i'm trying this new screening thing. you know, i figure if i'm always answering the phone, people'll think i don't have a life. my god, rodrigo never gets pinned.  

 hello, i'm looking for bob. this is jane. i don't know if you're still at this number, but i was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, i know it's been three years, but, i was kinda hoping we could hook up again. i barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what i did?

CHANDLER:
 what?

 i got a little drunk...and naked.

CHANDLER:
 bob here.

CHANDLER:
 

 oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new james bond poster.

CHANDLER:
 can you hold on a moment? i have another call. 

ROSS:
 i know.

CHANDLER:
 i'm back.

 so, are we gonna get together or what?

CHANDLER:
 um, absolutely. uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? do you know uh, central perk in the village, say, five-ish?

 great, i'll see you then.

CHANDLER:
 ok. ok. having a phone has finally paid off.

ROSS:
 even though you do do a good bob impression, i'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not bob."

CHANDLER:
 i'm hoping that when bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.

ROSS:
 oh my god. you are pure evil.

CHANDLER:
 ok, pure evil, horny and alone. i've done this. 

ROSS:
  mexico.

 hi, julie!

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 ok, while ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.

PHOEBE:
 um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? you know, like from, like 20?

CHANDLER:
 hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 so uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?

JOEY:
 well i guess i gotta start savin' up for ross's birthday, so i guess i'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.

PHOEBE:
 can you believe how much this is gonna cost?

RACHEL:
 do you guys ever get the feeling that um, chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?

JOEY:
 yes! yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". like we can afford to go here and there.

PHOEBE:
 yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? god, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for ross.

JOEY:
 for ross.

RACHEL:
 for ross, ross, ross.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hi.

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 i'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. all of a sudden, leon, the manager, calls me into his office. it turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.

JOEY:
 if it's not you, this is a horrible story.

MONICA:
 fortunately, it is me. and, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. anyway, i just ran into ross and chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. you know, someplace nice.

JOEY:
 yeah, someplace nice.  my kidney? 

ROSS:
 i'm tellin' you. you can't do this.

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on. i can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.

ROSS:
 that doesn't matter. she wanted to call bob. hey, for all we know, bob is who she was meant to be with. you may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.

CHANDLER:
 we don't know bob, ok? we know me. we like me. please let me be happy.

ROSS:
 go over there and tell that woman the truth.

CHANDLER:
 all right.

ROSS:
 go.

CHANDLER:
 hi.

CHANDLER:
 listen, i have to, uh, um, i have to, i have to confess something.

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. i just had this weird sense. you know, but that's me. i'm weird and sensitive. tissue?

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 hey, sorry i'm late. congratulations, mon.  how incredible was my afternoon with jade?

ROSS:
 well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. hey, chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?

CHANDLER:
 oh, see, i had to tell her that my number was your number, because i couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is bob's number.

ROSS:
 hey, tell me again, what do i do when mr. roper calls?

 do i dare ask?

MONICA:
 yes, i will start with the carpaccio, and then i'll have the grilled prawns. 

ROSS:
 that sounds great. same for me.

 and for the gentleman?

JOEY:
 yeah, i'll have the thai chicken pizza. but, hey, look, if i get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

 you'd think, wouldn't you? miss?

RACHEL:
 ok, i will have the uh, 

 

RACHEL:
 uh, i don't know. why don't you put it right here next to my water?

 and for you?

PHOEBE:
 um, i'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.

CHANDLER:
 i will have the uh, cajun catfish.

 anything else?

CHANDLER:
 yes, how 'bout a verse of killing me softly. you're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 um, everyone?

ROSS:
 oh, you're right, i'm sorry. 

JOEY:
 thank you.

ROSS:
 monica's big night, she shouldn't pay. 

MONICA:
 oh, thank you!

ROSS:
 so five of us is, $33.50 apiece.

PHOEBE:
 no, huh uh, no way, i'm sorry, not gonna happen.

CHANDLER:
 whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, monica, i'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? no! rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and joey with his like teeny pizza! it's just...

ROSS:
 ok, pheebs! how 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. it's no big deal.

PHOEBE:
 not for you.

MONICA:
 all right, what's goin' on?

RACHEL:
 ok, look you guys, i really don't want to get into this right now. i think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.

PHOEBE:
 fine. all right, fine.

JOEY:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 you can tell us. 

ROSS:
 hello, it's us, all right? it'll be fine.

JOEY:
 ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.

MONICA:
 ok.

ROSS:
 i hear ya. 

CHANDLER:
 we can talk about that.

PHOEBE:
 well, then...let's.

ROSS:
 i, i just never think of money as an issue.

RACHEL:
 that's 'cause you have it.

ROSS:
 that's a good point.

CHANDLER:
 so um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?

JOEY:
 'cause it's always somethin', you know, like monica's new job, or the whole ross's birthday hoopla.

ROSS:
 wha--? whoa, hey, i don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?

RACHEL:
 basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.

MONICA:
 if it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.

ROSS:
 g-gift? the thing's not the gift?

CHANDLER:
 no, the thing was, we were gonna go see hootie and the blowfish.

ROSS:
 hootie and the--oh my. i, i can catch them on the radio.

PHOEBE:
 no, now i feel bad. you wanna go to the concert.

ROSS:
 no, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.

MONICA:
 all of us.

CHANDLER:
 together.

ROSS:
 not at the concert.

RACHEL:
 ok.

JOEY:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 thank you.

JOEY:
 thanks.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 so, the ebola virus. that's gotta suck, huh? 

CHANDLER:
 gee, monica, what's in the bag?

MONICA:
 i don't know, chandler. let's take a look.

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's like a skit.

MONICA:
 why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for phoebe. 

ROSS:
 whoo!

PHOEBE:
 cool.

MONICA:
 yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.

ROSS:
 but wait, there's more. hey, chandler, what is in the envelope?

CHANDLER:
 by the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.

ROSS:
 come on.

CHANDLER:
 why, it's six tickets to hootie and the blowfish! the blowfish!

MONICA:
 it's on us, all right, so don't worry. it's our treat.

PHOEBE:
 so...thank you.

ROSS:
 could you be less enthused?

JOEY:
 look, it's a nice gesture, it is. but it just feels like--

MONICA:
 like?

JOEY:
 charity.

MONICA:
 charity?

ROSS:
 we're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.

RACHEL:
 ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.

PHOEBE:
 actually, it makes us feel that big.

ROSS:
 i don't, i don't understand. i mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.

CHANDLER:
 if you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. maybe that's just how you feel.

JOEY:
 oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.

RACHEL:
 ok, we never shoulda talked about this.

PHOEBE:
 i'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause i'm just not in a very hootie place right now.

RACHEL:
 me neither.

JOEY:
 me too.

MONICA:
 guys, we bought the tickets.

PHOEBE:
 oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.

CHANDLER:
 why did you look at me when you said that?

MONICA:
 well, i guess now we can't go.

RACHEL:
 what? come on, you do what you want to do. do we always have to do everything together?

MONICA:
 you know what? you're right.

PHOEBE:
 fine.

ROSS:
 fine.

JOEY:
 fine.

CHANDLER:
 fine.

RACHEL:
 fine.

MONICA:
 all right. we're gonna go. it's not for another six hours. we're gonna go then.

ROSS:
 chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

ROSS:
 geez! are you ready?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. just let me grab my jacket and tell you i had sex today.

ROSS:
 whoa! you had sex today?

CHANDLER:
 wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. i was awesome, ok? she was biting her lip to stop from screaming. 

ROSS:
 wow.

CHANDLER:
 now i know it's been awhile, but i took it as a good sign. 

ROSS:
 still doing the screening thing?

CHANDLER:
 i had sex today. i never have to answer that phone again.

 here comes the beep, you know what to do.

 hey, bob, it's jade. listen, i just wanted to tell you that i was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, i ended up meeting a guy.

CHANDLER:
 bob here.

 oh, hi.

CHANDLER:
 so, uh, you met someone, huh?

 yes, yes, i did. in fact, i had sex with him 2 hours ago. 

CHANDLER:
 so, uh, how was he?

 eh.

CHANDLER:
 eh?

 oh, bob, he was nothing compared to you. i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.

CHANDLER:
 well, that makes me feel so good.

 it was just so awkward and bumpy.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. and uh maybe you have to get used to it.

 well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what i mean? 

MONICA:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 terry is a jerk, ok? that's why we're always saying "terry's a jerk!" that's where that came from. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, ok. you probably did everything you could.  

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

 hello, there. i'm dr. carlin. i see someone's having an allergic reaction. 

MONICA:
 doctor, can i see you for just a minute please? my brother has a slight phobia about needles. 

ROSS:
 did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? 

MONICA:
 my brother, the phd would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.  

 no, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. 

ROSS:
 tho?   

ROSS:
 ohhh. 

MONICA:
 that's good, have a seat. um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. you're just gonna have to be brave, ok? can you do that for me? 

ROSS:
 ok. 

MONICA:
 ok. oh boy. you are doin' so good. you wanna squeeze my hand? all right, ross, don't squeeze it so hard. honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! oh, ross! let go of my hand! 

CHANDLER:
 that's a good plan, joe. next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. taxi, taxi! 

JOEY:
 hey, hey, look at that talent. 

CHANDLER:
  

 hey, you. he's just adorable. 

CHANDLER:
 ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
  i'm doing research for a book, and i was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. yes i do realize that would be a very stupid charact er. 

JOEY:
 hi, here's the deal. we lost a carseat on a bus today. it's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. oh, and there was a baby in it. he wants to talk to you again. 

RACHEL:
 ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm central perk welcome to-- 

PHOEBE:
  perk! 

RACHEL:
 uh, to stephanie schiffer.

PHOEBE:
  

 hi. we're the guys who called about the baby. we left the baby on ths bus. is he here? is he here? 

 he's here.  assuming one of you is the father. 

CHANDLER:
 that's me. 

JOEY:
 i'm him. 

CHANDLER:
 actually, uh, we're both the father.   both  

CHANDLER:
 please tell me you know which one is our baby. 

JOEY:
 well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. and ben was definitely wearing ducks. 

CHANDLER:
 ok. 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 yeah? 

JOEY:
 yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, ben, remember us? ok, the mole came off. 

JOEY:
 ahh! 

CHANDLER:
 what're we gonna do? what're we gonna do? 

JOEY:
 uh, uh, we'll flip for it. ducks or clowns. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, we're gonna flip for the baby? 

JOEY:
 you got a better idea?  

CHANDLER:
 all right, call it in the air. 

JOEY:
 heads. 

CHANDLER:
 heads it is. 

JOEY:
 yes! whew! 

CHANDLER:
 we have to assign heads to something. 

JOEY:
 right. ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. 

CHANDLER:
 what kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?   

RACHEL:
 hey. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, hi. 

RACHEL:
 here. i thought you might be cold. 

PHOEBE:
 thank you. 

RACHEL:
 whoa, look at you, you did pretty well. 

PHOEBE:
 eight dollars and 27 cents. but not really, 'cause i put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better. 

RACHEL:
 do you? 

PHOEBE:
 no. this whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. you know, i don't know, when i sang "su-su-suicide", i got a dollar seventy-five. but then, "smelly cat", i got 25 cents and a condom. so you know, now i just feel really bad for smelly cat. 

RACHEL:
 well, you know, honey, i don't think everybody gets smelly cat. you know, i mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! 

PHOEBE:
 it's not even that. i used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money. 

RACHEL:
 well, people missed you in there. and in fact, there was actually a request for "smelly cat". 

PHOEBE:
 really? from who? 

RACHEL:
 well, from me. and i know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite. 

 hi. uh, did i accidentally drop a condom in your case? it's kind of an emergency. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. here you go. 

 thanks a lot. hey christine, i got it!   

ROSS:
 i just wanna thank you for being there for me today. and i'm sorry i,i almost broke your hand. 

MONICA:
 that's ok. i'm sorry i poisoned you. 

ROSS:
 yeah. hey, remember the time i jammed that pencil into your hand? 

MONICA:
 remember it? what do you think this is, a freckle? 

ROSS:
 oh. 

MONICA:
 wait, what about the time i hit you in the face with the silvian's pumpkin? 

ROSS:
 oh, man. oh, remember when i stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?  

MONICA:
 no. but i remember people telling me about it. 

ROSS:
 i hope ben has a little sister. 

MONICA:
 yeah. i hope she can kick his ass. 

ROSS:
 i'm gonna get a new band-aid. hey, how 'bout the time i cut the legs off your malibu ken? 

MONICA:
 that was you? 

ROSS:
 they, uh, were infected. he wouldn't have made it. 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

 smelly cat, smel-ly cat... 

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 yeah, much better. and you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song. 

 yeah.  

PHOEBE:

 yeah. from the top? 

PHOEBE:
 ok, there is no top. that's the beauty of smelly cat. um, why don't you just follow me? 

 ok. 

PHOEBE:
 mmmm hmmm. 

 smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault. 

CHANDLER:
 ok, what is it about me? do i not look fun enough? is there something. . . repellant. . . about me? 

RACHEL:
 so, how was the party? 

CHANDLER:
 well it couldn't have been worse. a woman literally passed through me. ok, so what is it, am i hideously unattractive? 

PHOEBE:
 no, you are not, you are very attractive. you know what, i go through the exact same thing. every time i put on a little weight, i start questioning everyting. 

CHANDLER:
 woah, woah, i've put on a little weight? 

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 chandler, i'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. ya wanna work out? i can remake you.

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 no, whad'ya mean? he's not british. 

JOEY:
 maybe he's. . . gay. 

PHOEBE:
 oohh, um, no, i don't think that's the problem. 'cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes i just like... definitely felt something. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, but how much can you tell from a look? 

PHOEBE:
 no, i felt it on my hip. you could tell.   

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:
  

MONICA:

JOEY:
  

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. that's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time. 

ROSS:
 hopefully. 

RACHEL:
 well.  ok, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat.  supposed to take these when we leave.   

 i don't know if monica told you but this is the first date i've gone on since my divorce so, if i seem a little nervous, i am. 

RACHEL:
  

  

RACHEL:
 cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something? 

 um, maybe 15, 16 years. 

RACHEL:
 that's just great.  

 um, cheers. 

RACHEL:
 oh, right, clink.  

 monica told you i was cuter that this, didn't she? 

RACHEL:
 oh, no, michael, it's not you. i'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. it's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend. 

 oh, that does sound. . .ahh. 

RACHEL:
 i mean he just started going out with her. 

 is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend? 

RACHEL:
 ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. oh, i'm sorry, look at me. ok, michael, let's talk about you.  

 alright. 

RACHEL:
 ok, ok. so, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?   

PHOEBE:
 so, i figured it out. 

JOEY:
 what? 

PHOEBE:
 why scott doesn't want to sleep with me. it's 'cause i'm not sexy enough. 

JOEY:
 phoebe, that's crazy. when i first met you, you know what i said to chandler? i said, "excellent butt, great rack." 

PHOEBE:
 really? that's so sweet. i mean, i'm officially offended but, sweet. 

JOEY:
 phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him. 

PHOEBE:
 you're right, you're right. ah, you are so yumm.    puching and slapping harder and harder until monica pushes him down. chandler stands up,     

RACHEL:
  one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something?  called?

PHOEBE:
 hey joey. 

JOEY:
 hey phoebs. 

PHOEBE:
 how come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar? 

JOEY:
 i can't find the remote.  

PHOEBE:
 so, scott asked me to come over for lunch today and i did. 

JOEY:
 and? 

PHOEBE:
 and we did. 

JOEY:
 all right phoebs, way to go. 

PHOEBE:
 yay me. 

JOEY:
 so, so how did it happen? 

PHOEBE:
 well, i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on. 

JOEY:
 and what did he say? 

PHOEBE:
 he said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious. 

JOEY:
 wow. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, so i said, "ok, relax please," y'know, i mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. so after a looooot of talking. . . i convinced him. 

JOEY:
 let me get this straight. he got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea. 

PHOEBE:
 um-hum. 

JOEY:
 this man is my god.   

RACHEL:
 hi. 

ROSS:
 i didn't get a cat. 

RACHEL:
 oh, that's um, interesting. 

ROSS:
 no, no it's not interesting. ok, it's very, very not interesting. in fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting. 

RACHEL:
 alright, i got it ross. 

ROSS:
 you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. 

RACHEL:
  

ROSS:
 i was doing great with julie before i found out about you. 

RACHEL:
 hey, i was doin' great before i found out about you. you think it's easy for me to see you with julie? 

ROSS:
 then you should have said something before i met her. 

RACHEL:
 i didn't know then. and how come you never said anything to me. 

ROSS:
 there was never a good time. 

RACHEL:
 right, you, you only had a year. we only hung out every night. 

ROSS:
 not, not, not every night. you know, and... and it's not like i didn't try, rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? like, like italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or italian guys. 

RACHEL:
 hey, there was one italian guy, ok, and do you even have a point? 

ROSS:
 the point is i... i don't need this right now, ok. it, it's too late, i'm with somebody else, i'm happy. this ship has sailed. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me? 

ROSS:
 hey, i've been doin' it since the ninth grade, i've gotten pretty damn good at it. 

RACHEL:
 alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright ross. 

ROSS:
 fine. 

RACHEL:
 'cause i don't need your stupid ship. 

ROSS:
 good. 

RACHEL:
 good.  

RACHEL:
 and ya know what, now i've got closure.   her hands and begins to cry. ross comes back and is standing outside the window. when rachel regroups and gets back up to finish closing, she sees him. she smiles. she goes to  

ROSS:
 try the bottom one.      closing credits  

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 no way, with one pound to go, c'mon. we're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'. 

CHANDLER:
 ok, i don't, i don't mind the last pound. ok, in fact i kind of like the last pound. ok, so don't make me do anything that i'll regret. 

MONICA:
 ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? what? 

CHANDLER:
 nothing, except tell you, uh, i think it's wonderful how much energy you have. 

MONICA:
 well, thanks. 

CHANDLER:
 i mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work. 

MONICA:
 well, you know. 

CHANDLER:
 you know, i mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed. 

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 and it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on. 

MONICA:
 well no, but um. 

CHANDLER:
 i mean, if it were me, i think i'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all. 

MONICA:
 y'know, i try to stay positive. . . 

CHANDLER:
 so, you feel like goin' for a run? 

MONICA:
 alright. 

CHANDLER:
 because, you know, you don't have to. if you want, you could just take a nap right here. 

MONICA:
 ok. just for a little while. 

RACHEL:
 ross kissed me.

MONICA:
 oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

RACHEL:
 it was unbelievable!

MONICA:
 oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 ok, all right. we want to hear everything. monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?

RACHEL:
 oh, it ended very well.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? or was it like a, you know, a "i gotta have you now" kind of thing?

RACHEL:
 well, at first it was really intense, you know. and then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.

PHOEBE:
 ok, so, ok, was he holding you? or was his hand like on your back?

RACHEL:
 no, actually first they started on my waist. and then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.

 ohhhh. 

ROSS:
 and, uh, and then i kissed her.

JOEY:
 tongue?

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 cool. opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 all right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.

PHOEBE:
 wow. what are you gonna use it for?

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
  naked?

MONICA:
 there's an ad for a naked chef?

JOEY:
 no, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. and then...  

ROSS:
 hi.

PHOEBE:
 hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?

ROSS:
 that, that is funny. that is painfully funny. no, wait. wait, yeah, that's just painful

MONICA:
 wait a minute. i thought last night was great.

ROSS:
 yeah, it was, but...i get home, ok, and i see julie's saline solution on my night table. and i'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am i doing? i mean, here i am, i am with julie, this incredible, great woman, who i care about and who cares about me, and i'm like, what, am i just gonna throw all that away?

JOEY:
 you got all that from saline solution?

MONICA:
 we are talking about rachel here. you and rachel.

ROSS:
 believe me, i've been dreaming about me and rachel for ten years now. but now, i'm with julie, so it's like me and julie, me and rachel, me and julie, me and...  ... rachel. rachel, rachel.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 how are you?

RACHEL:
 good. how are you?

ROSS:
 good. 

 hi, honey.

ROSS:
 hi, julie. 

 good.

ROSS:
  play something, phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 oh, well, actually.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 ok, all right.

JOEY:
 hey, julie, i didn't know you wore lenses.

 what?

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that i made up. um, it's called, um, "two of them kissed last night".   

PHOEBE:
  now i can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. now our neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. will betty be the one who he loves truly? or will it be the one who we'll call ju...loolie? he must decide, he must decide, even though i made him up, he must decide! 

 this is a nice resume. nice, nice, nice. muy impressivo.

MONICA:
 so, mr. rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? the ad wasn't too clear.

 mockolate.

MONICA:
 i'm sorry?

 mockolate. it's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.

MONICA:
 ohh. 

 go ahead. try a piece. yeah, we think that mockolate is even better than chocolate.

MONICA:
 all right. mmm-mmm. 

 yeah?

MONICA:
  chocolate doesn't do that.

 no, ma'am. well, anyhoo, we should be getting our f.d.a. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for thanksgiving. see, the way we look at it, chocolate already

 easter, christmas, what have you.

MONICA:
 

 but, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make thanksgiving the mockolate holiday.

MONICA:
 wow.

 aren't you going to swallow that?

MONICA:
 just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

 yeah, isn't that great?

MONICA:
 

 well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some thanksgiving-themed recipes. you think you might be interested?

MONICA:
 abso... thanksgiving. and, well, now, i love mockolate.

 really?

MONICA:
 especially the after taste, you know, i'll tell ya, that'll last ya till christmas.  

MONICA:
 how about mockolate mousse?

PHOEBE:
 it's not, it's not very thanksgiving-y.

MONICA:
 ok, how about pilgrim mockolate mousse?

PHOEBE:
 what makes it pilgrim?

MONICA:
 we'll put buckles on it. 

RACHEL:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 did uh, ross call?

MONICA:
 no, i'm sorry.

RACHEL:
 why didn't he call? he's gonna stay with julie, isn't he? he's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "hi, i'm julie, ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."

PHOEBE:
 no offense, but that sounds nothing like her.  

ROSS:
 i don't know what to do. what am i gonna do? i mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.

CHANDLER:
 oh, i know. this must be so hard. oh, no. two women love me. they're both gorgeous and sexy. my wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.

JOEY:
 hey, here's a thought, ross. 

CHANDLER:
 don't touch the computer. don't ever touch the computer.

JOEY:
 ross, listen. i got two words for you. threesome. 

CHANDLER:
 ok, all right, look. let's get logical about this, ok? we'll make a list. rachel and julie, pros and cons. oh. we'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and i can use different colors for each column.

ROSS:
 can't we just use a pen?

CHANDLER:
 no, amish boy.

JOEY:
 ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. all right, rachel first.

ROSS:
 i don't know. i mean, all right, i guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.

JOEY:
 you could say that.

ROSS:
 and i guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. and i've seen her be a little too into her looks. oh, and julie and i, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but rachel's just a waitress.

CHANDLER:
 waitress. got it. you guys wanna play doom? or we could keep doing this. what else?

ROSS:
 i don't know.

JOEY:
 oh, her ankles are a little chubby.

CHANDLER:
 ok, let's do julie. what's wrong with her?

ROSS:
   

MONICA:
 ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. this is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. just like the indians served. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god.

MONICA:
 oh my god good?

RACHEL:
 oh my god, i can't believe you let me put this in my mouth. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, oh sweet lord! this is what evil must taste like!  

CHANDLER:
 i'm telling you this thing won't print. yes, i pressed that button like 100 times. you know, for a hot line you are not so hot. what? what is that in the background? are you watching star trek? 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 yes, it was horrible. she cried. i cried. she threw things, they hit me. anyway, i did the right thing.

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:
 hey, do you guys have...

ROSS:
 hi.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i uh, i just got back from uh, from julie's.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 no, no, uh, it's not what you think. it's um the other thing.

RACHEL:
 well, what's the other thing, what do i think? 

ROSS:
 well, uh.

JOEY:
 he broke up with julie. well, go hug her, for god's sakes.

RACHEL:
 really?

ROSS:
 really. it's always been you, rach. 

RACHEL:
 oh, god.

 ohhh.

RACHEL:
 oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.

ROSS:
 i know, i know, it's, it's almost... do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?

RACHEL:
 let me get my coat.

ROSS:
 ok. no, hey, whoa, whoa, i'll get your coat. 

RACHEL:
 ok, he's goin' to get my coat. he's goin' to get my coat. oh my god, you guys. i can't believe this. this is unbelievable.  that?

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:
 what's that? what? i saw my name. what is it?

CHANDLER:
 no, no, see? see?   hey, it's printing! 

RACHEL:
 well what is it? let me see. 

ROSS:
 hey, someone order a coat?

RACHEL:
 ross, chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.

ROSS:
 he won't?  the short story you were writing?

CHANDLER:
 yes, yes it is, short story, that i was writing.

RACHEL:
 and i'm in it? then let me read it.

 no!

RACHEL:
 come on.

JOEY:
 hey, uh, why don't you read it to her? 

CHANDLER:
  was hot. rachel was there. a lonely gray couch. 'oh, look,' cried ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. the end."

ROSS:
 that's it? that's all you wrote? you're the worst writer in the whole world.

RACHEL:
 all right, you know what? this isn't funny anymore. there's something about me on that piece of paper and i want to see it.

ROSS:
 no, you don't.

RACHEL:
 all right, you know what, that's fine. if you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. i do not need to see it.  

RACHEL:
 what is this? ross, what is this?

CHANDLER:
 good luck. 

ROSS:
 ok, just, just remember how crazy i am about you, ok?

RACHEL:
 kind of ditzy? too into her looks? spoiled?

ROSS:
 now that's a little spoiled. he was supposed to type "little", the idiot.

RACHEL:
 just a waitress?

ROSS:
 no, that, that was, i mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. is this over yet rach?

RACHEL:
 oh! i do not have chubby ankles! 

ROSS:
 no, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. look at julie's column.

RACHEL:
 she is not rachem. what the hell's a rachem? is that some stupid paleontology word that i wouldn't know because i'm just a waitress. 

ROSS:
 no, rach, come on. rach! rach, no, no! she's not rachel, she is, she is not, ra--rachel? 

CHANDLER:
 my diary! my diary, that's brilliant. i should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.

MONICA:
 you know, that's true. you'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.

PHOEBE:
 i... i cannot believe ross even made this list. what a dinkus.

JOEY:
 hey, cut him some slack. it was chandler's idea.

PHOEBE:
 what?

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 oh good, i was hoping that would come up.

MONICA:
 this was your idea?

PHOEBE:
 what were you thinking?

CHANDLER:
  happen for a reason.

MONICA:
 yeah. you!

CHANDLER:
 all right, pheebs, back me up here, ok? you believe in that karma crap, don't you?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.  

ROSS:
 rach! whoops! rach, hey, open up, please!

RACHEL:
  doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.

ROSS:
 i just wanna read something. it's your pro list.

RACHEL:
 not interested. 

ROSS:
 

 the way you play with your hair when you're

 how brave you are for starting your life over. number five: how great you are with ben.  

ROSS:
 number six: the way you smell.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 hey, joey. you wanna open the window?

JOEY:
 oh, yeah, i do. 

CHANDLER:
 what are you doing out there?

ROSS:
 i am, uh, i am...

MONICA:
 oh, you must be freezing. you know what you need? how about a nice steaming cup of hot mockolate? 

ROSS:
 rach, come on, open up. rach, come on, come on, rach. you got to give me another chance. 

RACHEL:
 no.

ROSS:
 no?

RACHEL:
 that's what i said.

CHANDLER:
 look, maybe we should go?

RACHEL:
 no, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.

ROSS:
 rach, come on, look, i know how you must feel.

RACHEL:
  yourself. now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.

ROSS:
 no, but, but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things.

RACHEL:
 oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, ross.  go!

ROSS:
 you know what? you know what? if, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.

RACHEL:
 well, then, i guess that's the difference between us. see, i'd never make a list.  

JOEY:
  situation before you can talk again, you know?  longer. 

MONICA:
 now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. i've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.

 doesn't matter.

MONICA:
 what?

 our fda approval didn't come through. something about laboratory rats.

MONICA:
 oh, gosh, i'm sorry.

 yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.  trouble you went through. um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?

MONICA:
 well, uh, i ate some.

 oh, some, that's fine. some is fine. some is not a lot. so, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?  

MONICA:
 hello? 

ROSS:
 hi.

RACHEL:
  weighin' me down.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 look, can, can you do something for me?

MONICA:
 sure, what? ok, ok.  

 the next one's dedicated to rachel from ross. rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.     

 uh, we've just gotten a call from rachel, and she told us what ross did. it's pretty appalling, and ross, if you're listening, i don't wanna play your song anymore. why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? avery, michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out. 

 hi, thanks for coming in again.

MONICA:
 oh, not at all. i have no morals and i need the cash.

 it's like i'm lookin' in a mirror. anyway, they're called "fishtachios". they taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. here, try one. you're not allergic to anything, are you?

MONICA:
 cat hair.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. ugly naked guy is decorating his tree. oh my god, you should see the size of his christmas balls.   

JOEY:
 hey. 

CHANDLER:
 hey. 

RACHEL:
 hey. 

JOEY:
 hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year? 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad. 

MONICA:
 oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies. 

CHANDLER:
 and twenty-five it is. 

JOEY:
 you gave him cookies? 

MONICA:
 money is so impersonal. cookies says someone really cares. . . alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that. 

PHOEBE:
 i can see that. a plate of brownies once told me a limerick. 

CHANDLER:
 phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies? 

PHOEBE:
 not especially. but you know what, i think they had pot in them. 

ROSS:
 so you guys, who else did you tip with cookies? 

RACHEL:
 uhh, the mailman, the super.   

MONICA:
 oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.   

JOEY:
 oh my god. 

RACHEL:
 what? 

JOEY:
 uhhh, i don't think you're gonna like this.   

RACHEL:
 ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me? 

ROSS:

 yeah. 

ROSS:

ROSS:

 hey. 

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

 hey. hi phoebe. 

PHOEBE:
 happy christmas eve eve.  this? 

ROSS:
 uh, macy's, third floor, home furnishings. 

PHOEBE:
 this is my father, this is a picture of my dad. 

CHANDLER:
 nah, phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame. 

PHOEBE:
 no it isn't, this is my dad, alright, i'll show you. 

RACHEL:
 phoebe, i thought your dad was in prison. 

PHOEBE:
 no, that's my stepdad. my real dad's the one that ran out on us before i was born. 

RACHEL:
 how have you never been on oprah? 

PHOEBE:
  before she died, same guy. 

MONICA:
 honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie. 

PHOEBE:
 it's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. ok, i have to talk to my grandmother.  

MONICA:
 oh, wait a minute honey. 

 phoebs.  

MONICA:
 wow. 

JOEY:
 so anyway, i'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . . 

 joey! 

JOEY:
 oh, but when phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!    

 esther livingston.    

 hi, phoe. 

PHOEBE:
 hi gram. whatcha doin'? 

 oh, just updating the phonebook. 

PHOEBE:
 um, gram, um, can i see the pictures of my dad again? 

  

PHOEBE:
 just, you know, to see... um. 

 oh, sure, yeah.  in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, is this really my father? 

 is it really your fa--i can't... well of course it is. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, i smell smoke. maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire. 

 look, i. . . 

PHOEBE:
 ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. 

 alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. 

PHOEBE:
 oh god. 

 it was your mother's idea. ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, i didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. not impossible, but harder. 

PHOEBE:
 alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? and then, i guess, ok, he doesn't live in a hut in burma where there's no phones? 

 last i heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, that makes no sense. why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? 

 honey. 

PHOEBE:
  

 anyway, that's all i know. that, and this.   this is the real him. 

PHOEBE:
 oh.    

CHANDLER:
 ya know i remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. he didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. 

RACHEL:
 well, that doesn't sound like a very merry christmas. 

CHANDLER:
 who said anything about christmas?   

MONICA:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 oh, by the way mon, i don't think the mailman liked your cookies. here are the ornaments your mom sent.  

MONICA:
 well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough. 

JOEY:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 well, not so good. upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math. 

 well, i think you're better off without him. oh honey, i know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her gremlin. 

PHOEBE:
 no i just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know. 

 i know. ok, i wasn't completely honest with you when i told you that, uh, i didn't know exactly where he lived. 

PHOEBE:
 whattaya mean? 

 he lives at 74 laurel drive in middletown. if you hit the dairy queen, you've gone too far. you can take my cab. 

PHOEBE:
 wow. thank you.

MONICA:
 you were so amazing as the king. i was really impressed, i was.

PHOEBE:
 although, you know what? you might want to consider wearing underwear next time. yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.

JOEY:
 here it is, here it is.  mindless, adolescent direction was joseph tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.

CHANDLER:
 ok, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. phoebs, read yours.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 maybe they do. i've been doin' this ten years and i haven't gotten anywhere. there's gotta be a reason.

ROSS:
 oh c'mon. maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.

JOEY:
 no, no, no, it.. it's too hard. it's not worth it. i quit.

MONICA:
 wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. wait a minute. i believe this will change your mind.  to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153... credits

PHOEBE:
 half full of looooovvvvve.

MONICA:
 and for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.

PHOEBE:
 cabin of loooooovvvvve.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 i just had a glass.

PHOEBE:
 two.

RACHEL:
 i had one glass.

CHANDLER:
 i had about a mugful in this lovely 'i got boned at the museum of natural history' mug.

RACHEL:
 ok, so that's... that's what, two bottles? and yet somehow we went through five? 

ROSS:
 oooooh.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 so what. so he drank a lot tonight.

ROSS:
 yeah but, you know, now that i think about it, i don't think i've ever seen fun bobby without a... a drink in his hand.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. oh, oooh, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, ok, 'i was soooo wasted,' or, 'oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'so i wake up, and i'm in this dumpster in connecticut.'

JOEY:
 monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?

MONICA:
 well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. i mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.  

MONICA:
 rach, does this have nonfat milk?

RACHEL:
 ehhhummmm, i don't know, why don't you taste it.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.

  

PHOEBE:
 um, cake.

RACHEL:
 yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.  

MONICA:
 you know what? it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff irish lately.

 well, i would make them belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.

MONICA:
 bobby.

 yeah, ok.

MONICA:
 look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, i don't know... but, uh, i'm kind of worried about you.

 ok, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, i don't know... i always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'i'm just a social drinker,' or, 'c'mon, it's flag day.'

MONICA:
 so, what are you saying now?

 i guess i'm saying, i'll try and quit. i kinda like that you worry about me. 

PHOEBE:
 

 i am gonna try and quit drinking.

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 oh, well, we have to celebrate. you know what we should do? we should do, like, a soap opera theme.

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 noooo, no, i'm not mad at him. i'm.. i'm not really anything at him anymore.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 i don't know. whatever i was feeling, i'm... not.

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 oh, i know, i'm sorry you guys. you're just gonna have to get used to the fact that i will not be dating ross.  

RACHEL:
 here he is. hi. guys, this is russ.

JOEY:
 ok, uh.... listen, there's something i want to talk to you about. the network casting lady...

 oh, isn't lori a doll?

JOEY:
 oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... i kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. and i definitely would get the part if i would've... you know... if i would have sent the little general in.

 oh, i see. well, i'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out.  darling. so how 'bout joey tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific?  yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.  

RACHEL:
 what's the matter?

MONICA:
 it's fun bobby.

RACHEL:
 what, isn't he sober?

MONICA:
 oh, he's sober alright. just turns out that fun bobby was fun for a reason.

RACHEL:
 ohhh, ok. 

MONICA:
 alright, here you go, sweetie. 

 thanks. you wanna hear something funny?

MONICA:
 oh god, yes!

 there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the village.

PHOEBE:
 that is funny.

 i needed to buy a hammer the other night, and i'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the village.

MONICA:
 ahhh, hey honey? don't you have to be at your interview now?

 oh yeah. see you guys. 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 it's not that bad.

MONICA:
 not that bad? did you hear the hammer story?

PHOEBE:
 ok, ok, don't get all squinky.

RACHEL:
 maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.

MONICA:
 but i'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. i mean, i can't break up with him. i'm the one who made him quit drinking. he's dull because of me.

PHOEBE:
 alright, don't say that. he's probably always been dull. you just, you know, set it free. 

 hi.

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 hi russ, i've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, ok?

 ok, i'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
  

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.

CHANDLER:

 oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.

ROSS:
 yes, yes i am. and you are a....

 periodontist.

MONICA:

ROSS:

 ditto. 

ROSS:
 i, uh, well... i... i met russ.

RACHEL:
 oh.

ROSS:
 hey, i didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.

RACHEL:
 well, we're not seeing each other, so....

ROSS:
 well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. but so far i've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...

RACHEL:
 well, yeah, this is the deal.

ROSS:
 ok, well, um, have a nice evening.

RACHEL:
 um, russ, you ready?

 yeah.

RACHEL:
 bye.

MONICA:
 bye.

PHOEBE:
 bye. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?

ROSS:
 what do you mean?

MONICA:
 do you not see it?

ROSS:
 see what? i don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. and it takes him, what? like... like... i don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?

ROSS:
 ....................yeah.  

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 whoa, whoa, so i'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, italy called and said it was hungry.

JOEY:
 well, the part's mine if i want it.

CHANDLER:
 oh my god!

JOEY:
 yeah, if i'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 ten years i've been waiting for a break like this chandler, ten years! i mean, days of our lives. that's actually on television.

CHANDLER:
 so, what're you gonna do?

JOEY:
 well, i guess i could sleep with her... i mean, how could i do that?

CHANDLER:
 well, i... i've got a pop-up book that told me everything i need to know.

JOEY:
 i've never slept with someone for a part.

CHANDLER:
 well is she...  

JOEY:
 sorry.

CHANDLER:
 it's alright. is she good-looking?

JOEY:
 yeah, she's totally good looking. i mean, if i met her in a bar, or something, i'd be buying her breakfast. 

CHANDLER:
 y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. y'know, i mean, the way that i see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. y'know, i mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got christmas.

JOEY:
 i just... i just don't think that i want it that way though, y'know? i mean, let's say i do make it, alright? i'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the little general.

CHANDLER:
 didn't you used to call it the little major?

JOEY:
 yeah, but after denise demarco, i had to promote it. 

 can i get you something from the bar?

MONICA:
 yes, i would like something.  you.

 if... if you want to drink, it's ok with me, i've got to get used to it.

MONICA:
 no, no really. i.. i wouldn't feel right about it. 

 so the light went out in my refrigerator...

MONICA:
   

CHANDLER:
 hey, we're having some fun now, huh, ross? wanna do another one, huh russ? ok... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.

 dysprosium.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 and weenie number two has it. unless, of course, nine-down, knights in white satin was sung by the doody blues. 

PHOEBE:
 you don't see it? you actually don't see it?

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 ok honey, you're dating ross.

RACHEL:
 no, phoebs. i'm dating russ.

PHOEBE:
 russ is ross. russ... ross!

RACHEL:
 steve... sleeve!

PHOEBE:
 ok, noone is named sleeve.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? other than their names being similar, i'm sorry, i do not see what you're seeing. 

ROSS:
 

 you could not be more wrong. you could try... but you would not be successful.

CHANDLER:
 ok, i'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.

 i know what your problem is.

ROSS:
 oh you do, do you?

 um-hum, you're jealous.

ROSS:
 of... of what?

 you're jealous because i'm a real doctor.

ROSS:
 hey, you're a doctor of gums. that's the smallest body part you can major in. it's like day one, floss. day two, here's your diploma.

 hey, you listen.

ROSS:
 no, no, let me finish.

 no, let me finish.

ROSS:
 no, you let me fini... 

ROSS:
 hi.

 hi.

RACHEL:
 ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!  

RACHEL:
 did joey say what he was gonna go when he left?

CHANDLER:
 no, i don't even think he knew. hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?

RACHEL:
 i don't know. who would i have to sleep with?

CHANDLER:
 me.

RACHEL:
 why would i have to sleep with you?

CHANDLER:
 it's my game. you want the job or not? 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

MONICA:
 morning.

ROSS:
 where ya goin'?

MONICA:
 bobby and i are going away for the weekend, remember?

ROSS:
 ooooohhhh. 

PHOEBE:
 what's with all the bottles of liquor?

ROSS:
 what's going on, is... uh, bobby drinking again?

MONICA:
 oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. that way he's still sober but i find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing. 

RACHEL:
 oh god, even his knock is boring. 

MONICA:
 hi. i'll be ready in just a second.

 uh, can i talk to you a minute?

MONICA:
 sure. 

 this is really hard for me to say.

MONICA:
 oh god, you fell off the wagon.

 oh, no, no, it's about you.

MONICA:
 what about me?

 i think you may have a drinking problem.

MONICA:
 what these?  scrapes.

 look, i am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, ok?

MONICA:
 oh... shoot.

 well, anyway, i hope we can be friends.

MONICA:
 ok. 

MONICA:
 take care.

 you too. 

RACHEL:
 what happened?

MONICA:
 well we... we kinda broke up.

 awwwwwwww. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 i'll take one. sometimes i like to hold stuff like this and pretend i'm a giant. 

JOEY:
 hey.

 hey!

ROSS:
 how'd the callback go?

JOEY:
 it was unbelievable! i walked in there and she was all over me.

CHANDLER:
 so what'd you do?

JOEY:
 well, i couldn't do it. i told her i didn't want to get the part that way.

ROSS:
 good for you.

JOEY:
 but wait, wait, wait. then, after i left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.

PHOEBE:
 so... and?

JOEY:
 soooooo... you are now looking at dr. drake ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!

 allright!

JOEY:
 alright... i've got to go shower.   credits  

 hi.

CHANDLER:
 oh, hey.

PHOEBE:
 hi.

 i guess you guys heard, rachel dumped me.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i'm sorry man.

 oh, all she said was that i remind her too much of somebody. you have any idea who she's talking about? 

PHOEBE:
 oh i do, it's.... it's bob saget. she hates him.

 oh. 

 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey, julie! hey, how are you doing?

ROSS:
 ok. here's his diaper bag, and his uh, mr. winky, and uh...oh, him. hi!

 so how did everything go?

ROSS:
 oh, great. great. there was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.

 well, we've gotta go.

ROSS:
 ok.

 

 oh, right. um, i've got some news. it's about us.

ROSS:
 oh, you and me?

 uh, no, susan and me.

 the other us.

ROSS:
 ok.

 we're uh, we're getting married.

ROSS:
 as in, "i now pronounce you wife and wife" married?

 anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.

ROSS:
 why wouldn't i want to come? i had fun at the first wedding.

 look i just thought that...

ROSS:
 no no no, i mean, hey, why shouldn't i be happy for you? what would it say about me if i couldn't revel in your joy? i'm revelling baby, believe me!

 is your finger caught in that chair?

ROSS:
 mmm hmmm.

 want us to go?

ROSS:
 uh-huh. 

ROSS:
 this is so cool. you're actually gonna be on television.

JOEY:
 it really hit me last night. i'm gonna be on days of our lives. and then i started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..

MONICA:
 yes! carol and susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.

 yes!

MONICA:
 they want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as i've never catered before, and i really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?

ROSS:
 would it matter?

MONICA:
 oh, you are so great! 

JOEY:
 are you really not going?

ROSS:
 i am really not going. i don't get it. they already live together, why do they need to get married?

MONICA:
 they love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.

ROSS:
 if you wanna call that a reason.

CHANDLER:
  bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? hi, neighbor.

MONICA:
 ross, i thought you were over this.

ROSS:
 look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? she's my ex-wife. if she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.

JOEY:
 hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 no, i'm on right after this guy shoots himself.

CHANDLER:
 whoa, she's pretty.

JOEY:
 yeah, and she's really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.

RACHEL:
 i'm sorry, what?

MONICA:
 what?

JOEY:
 it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, ok.

JOEY:
 there's my scene, there's my scene.  dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. 

 is she gonna be all right?

JOEY:
 i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.

CHANDLER:
 nice!

RACHEL:
 that's great!

ROSS:
 excellent!

CHANDLER:
 for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin' to smell something. 

ROSS:
 that is so good! do it again!

JOEY:
 all right, all right. "damnit braverman, it's right there on the chart!"

CHANDLER:
 that's great. all right, i gotta get to work, i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

ROSS:
 no no, that's me.

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah. 

ROSS:
 oh, hello.

PHOEBE:
 oh, thanks. i couldn't uh...

ROSS:
 is everything ok?

PHOEBE:
 um, no, huh-uh. one of my clients died on the massage table today.

ROSS:
 oh my god.

CHANDLER:
 that's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, um, she was 82 years old. her name was um, mrs. adelman.

MONICA:
 oh, honey.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, it's just so strange. i mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, i'll have some breakfast, and then i'll take a little walk, and then i'll have my massage." little did she know god was thinking, "ok, but that's it." oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, i was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, i don't think it went very far.

RACHEL:
 what do you mean?

PHOEBE:
 i think it went into me.  

MONICA:
 god, this is so hard. i can't decide between lamb or duck.

CHANDLER:
 well, of course, lambs are scarier. otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the ducks.

RACHEL:
 ok, who ordered what?

ROSS:
 oh, i believe i had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.

CHANDLER:
 yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?

RACHEL:
 oh god.

JOEY:
 i can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.

RACHEL:
 i know, but it's just it's the first time, and i just don't want her to think that because i didn't marry barry, that my life is total crap, you know?

PHOEBE:
  tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time.

JOEY:
 uh, pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?

PHOEBE:
 i don't know. i mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.   sit up!

 

RACHEL:
 mom!

 sweetie! so this is where you work? oh, it's wonderful! is it a living room? is it a restaurant? who can tell? but i guess that's the fun.

RACHEL:
 pretty much.

 monica! you look gorgeous! last time i saw you, it was eat or be eaten.

RACHEL:
 this is joey, and phoebe, and this is chandler, and you remember ross.

 oh hello, ross. 

ROSS:
 hi, mrs. green. 

 so, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?

RACHEL:
 oh mom!

 if you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.

CHANDLER:
 believe me, sometimes that happens.

 this is just so exciting. you know, i never worked. i went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. i am just so proud of you.

RACHEL:
 really?

 yes.

PHOEBE:
 i know who it is you remind me of. evelyn dermer. 'course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. now she looks like soupy sales.

JOEY:
 pheebs, who's evelyn dermer?

PHOEBE:
 i don't know. who's soupy sales? 

 oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.

RACHEL:
 yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.

 

RACHEL:
 i know. and mom, i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?

 i do. you didn't love barry. and i've never seen you this happy. i look at you and i think, oh, this is what i want.

RACHEL:
 for...me.

 well, not just for you.

RACHEL:
 well, what do you mean?

 i'm uh, considering leaving your father.

MONICA:
  chicken breasts.

RACHEL:
 oh god. i think i'm gonna be sick.

MONICA:
 why? it's not like i'm putting little nipples on them.

ROSS:
 and you had no idea they weren't getting along?

RACHEL:
 none.

JOEY:
 they didn't fight a lot?

RACHEL:
 no! they didn't even talk to each other. god, how was i supposed to know they were having problems?

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 hey, look who's up.

RACHEL:
 i just can't believe this is happening. i mean, when i was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. i just figured as a grownup i wouldn't have to worry about this.

MONICA:
 is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? i mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.

RACHEL:
 well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?

CHANDLER:
 you know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. but in your case it's actually kinda true.

PHOEBE:
 that's him.

CHANDLER:
 damn. my mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.

 phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 yes, hi, mr. adelman. thanks for meeting me.

 oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.

PHOEBE:
 um, do you wanna sit?

 oh, no, please, i spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. now uh, what can i do for you, my dear?

PHOEBE:
 i don't know how to say this, but i think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.

 you're saying, my wife is in you?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?

 well, i don't know what to tell you dear. the only thing i can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.

PHOEBE:
 everything?

 everything.

PHOEBE:
 whoa, that's a lot of stuff.

 oh, wait, i remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.

  

 look at this.

RACHEL:
 these are from halloween three years ago.

 oh, look, here's barry. did he have to come straight from the office?

RACHEL:
 no, that was his costume. see, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.

MONICA:
 um, you guys, you know when i said before, "thank you, but i don't really need your help"?

RACHEL:
 actually, what i think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."

MONICA:
 really? weird. anyway, see, i planned everything really well. i planned and i planned and i planned. it just turns out, i don't think i planned enough time to actually do it.

RACHEL:
 hey, mon, you want some help?

MONICA:
 if you want.

PHOEBE:
  art, rockefeller center, statue of liberty.

RACHEL:
 she's still with you?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. i guess she hasn't seen everything yet. i'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.   oh, such a pretty face.

 this is so much fun, just the girls. you know what we should do? does anybody have any marijuana?

RACHEL:
 god!

MONICA:
 all right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. 

 that's fine. i never did it. i just thought i might. so, what's new in sex?

RACHEL:
 oh! what's new in sex?

 the only man i've ever been with is your father.

MONICA:
 i'm dicing, i'm dicing, i don't hear anything.

 i mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but i was thinking there might be more.

RACHEL:
 oh, i'm sorry. you know what? i cannot have this conversation with you. i mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell daddy. what? what do you want? do you want my blessing?

 no.

RACHEL:
 you want me to talk you out of it?

 no.

RACHEL:
 then what? what do you want?

 i guess i just figured of all people you would understand this.

RACHEL:
 why on earth would i understand this?

 you didn't marry your barry. i did.

RACHEL:
 oh.

MONICA:
 all right people, we're in trouble here. we've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. move, move, move!

CHANDLER:
 monica, i feel like you should have german subtitles.

MONICA:
 joey, speed it up!

JOEY:
 i'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!

PHOEBE:
 monica, how did this happen? i thought you had this all planned out.

MONICA:
 do you want me to cry? is that what you want? do you wanna see me cry?

PHOEBE:
 sir! no sir!

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 no. look, i told you i am not a part of this thing.

MONICA:
 all right, look, ross. i realize that you have issues with carol and susan, and i feel for you, i do. but if you don't help me cook, i'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and i'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in ross". all right, ball the melon.

CHANDLER:
 hey! how come i'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. 

MONICA:
 hi.

 how's it going?

MONICA:
 it's goin' great. right on schedule. got my little happy helpers. 

 fine, whatever.

ROSS:
 what's the matter?

 nothing. ok, everything. i think we're calling off the wedding.

ROSS:
 what?

MONICA:
 you're still gonna pay me, right? or something a little less selfish.

ROSS:
 carol, what's the matter? what happened?

 my parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.

ROSS:
 oh my god.

 i mean, i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. they're supposed to give me away and everything.

ROSS:
 it's ok. i'm sorry.

 and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if i couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. i don't know what to do.

ROSS:
 i uh can't believe i'm gonna say this, but i think susan's right.

 you do?

ROSS:
 look, do you love her? and you don't have to be too emphatic about this.

 of course i do.

ROSS:
 well then that's it. and if george and adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. look, this is your wedding. do it.

 you're right. of course you're right.

MONICA:
 so we're back on?

 we're back on.

MONICA:
 you heard the woman. peel, chop, devil! i can't believe i lost 2 minutes. 

JOEY:
 it just seems so futile, you know ? all these women, and nothing. i feel like superman without my powers, you know? i have the cape, and yet i cannot fly.

CHANDLER:
 well now you understand how i feel every single day, ok? the world is my lesbian wedding. 

PHOEBE:
  later.  

 thank you.

ROSS:
 any time. 

 ross. 

 you know, nothing makes god happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. friends, family, we're gathered here today to join carol and susan in holy matrimony.

PHOEBE:
   whoa, she's gone. she's gone. she's gone! go ahead, get married. go, go.  

MONICA:
 would you look at them?

ROSS:
 yeah, can't help but.

JOEY:
   i wrapped those bad boys.

PHOEBE:
 i miss rose. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah? 

PHOEBE:
 i know it's kind of weird, but i mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now i just feel kind of alone.

 you know, i uh, i couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and i think it's time for you to forget about rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?

PHOEBE:
 ok, that's so nice.  

CHANDLER:
  line, right? 

RACHEL:
 hey, mom? having fun?

 oh, am i! i just danced with a wonderfully large woman. and three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. oh, i'm not saying it's something i wanna pursue, but it's nice to know i have options.

RACHEL:
 there's more alcohol, right? 

 how you doin'?

ROSS:
 ok.

 you did a good thing today.

ROSS:
 yeah.

 you wanna dance?

ROSS:
 no, that's fine.

 come on. i'll let you lead.

ROSS:
 ok. 

CHANDLER:
  we're all people.  

MONICA:
 ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?

ROSS:
 well, mon, i was married.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, me, too, technically.

RACHEL:
 i had a wedding.

MONICA:
 all right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.

JOEY:
 i got one. which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?  

CHANDLER:
 isn't ben in this?

 can't get the monkey off your back? then put it in your mouth...    

 ...with monkeyshine beer.     

ROSS:
 that commercial always makes me so sad. 

JOEY:
 yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out ok. 

ROSS:
 i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel. 

PHOEBE:
 i can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.

MONICA:
 and the fact that they're both monkeys. 

ROSS:
 sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. 

RACHEL:
 oh, ross, you had to, i mean, he was humping everything in sight. i mean, i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. 

ROSS:
 remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. when i did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden i have this big attitude problem.  opening titles      

JOEY:
 hey, hey, check it out, guess what i got. 

CHANDLER:
 rhythm? 

JOEY:
 no, my first fan mail. 

 alright! 

MONICA:
  you.' gosh. 'your not-so-secretive admirer, erica ford.' ooh wait, 'ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' 

RACHEL:
 ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. 

MONICA:
 this wasn't addressed to days of our lives, this is, this came to your apartment. there's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. 

JOEY:
 oh my god, i got my very own stalker.   

ROSS:
 hey guys. 

 hey. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, where are you off to, travelin' jake? 

ROSS:
 well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in l.a. so i figured i'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel. 

CHANDLER:
 you know i think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.   

RACHEL:
 oh, phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, oh, ok, so everyone, pretend like i'm telling you a story, ok. and, and it's really funny. so everyone just laugh, now.   

PHOEBE:
 i know, i know.  

 hi. i'm rob dohnen. 

PHOEBE:
 hi rob dohnen. 

 i don't know anything about music, but i think you're really, really great. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, wow. 

 anyway, i schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and i was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that i will write for them.    

JOEY:
 hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner? 

CHANDLER:
 well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.    

CHANDLER:
 hello. 

 it's erica. 

JOEY:
 ah, the stalker. 

 never mind, it's open. 

CHANDLER:
  might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon. 

JOEY:
 let's get out of here.   

CHANDLER:
 the one time they're not home. 

JOEY:
 ok, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.

CHANDLER:
 that's how radio stars escape stalkers. 

JOEY:
 she's comin'.   

 it's me. 

JOEY:
 uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. ready? 

CHANDLER:
 wait, wait, wait.     

 hi. 

JOEY:
 erica.   

 hi, dean lipson, zoo administrator. i was told you had a question. 

ROSS:
 well, i uh, i can't seem to find the monkey i donated last year. he's a capuchan, answers to the name marcel. 

 ahh, i'm afraid i have some bad news. marcel has passed on. 

ROSS:
 oh my god, what happened? 

 well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. 

ROSS:
 i can't believe this. 

 i'm sorry mr. geller. but ya know, there's an old saying, 'sometimes monkeys die.' it's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. 

ROSS:
 well, ya know, someone should have called me. 

 i'm sorry. look, i know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. 

ROSS:
 zoo dollars? 

 yes, and come see the bird show at 4. the macaws wear hats. well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.      

 ooohhh. 

PHOEBE:
 i know. 

MONICA:
 i can't believe joey's having lunch with his stalker. what i-, what is she like. 

CHANDLER:
 well, you remember cathy bates in misery? 

 yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 well, she looks the exact opposite of that. 

RACHEL:
 and she's not crazy? 

CHANDLER:
 oh no no no, she's a total wack job. yeah, she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake remore. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god. 

MONICA:
 ah, and i mean, he's going out with her? he can not persue this. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. i mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? what're you lookin' at me for? he's the one who wants to boff the maniac. 

 you ok? 

PHOEBE:
 no, uh-uh, i'm just, i'm nervous. so, you know what, maybe if i just, if i picture them all in their underwear. 

 that's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. 

PHOEBE:
 i'm just, i'm, i'm, i'm used to playing for grown-ups. ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. this is a huge responsibility. what? are you gonna kiss me? 

ROSS:
 i was thinkin' about it. 

PHOEBE:
 ok.  

 hi phoebe. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, um, i'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, ok.  now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. but lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, and last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. now, your mom and your dad said she moved to peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. la-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...   

 oh, drake, isn't it amazing? 

JOEY:
 yeah it is. . . what? 

 well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord. 

JOEY:
 yeah, that was a tricky one. in reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. 

 who's they? 

JOEY:
 no one. 

 oh drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh i could just eat them. . . but i won't. 

JOEY:
 good, otherwise my watch would fall off.  

 no, seriously. these hands. these miracle, magical, life-giving hands. oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one? 

JOEY:
 alright, just one.  that.   

 oh my god! someone, he's choking. is anyone here a doctor? 

 well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of salem, dr. drake remore.   

 meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes. 

ROSS:
 uhh, hey look, i don't really enjoy being with other men that way. but, um, zoo dollars? 

 it's about your monkey. it's alive.   

 i don't understand, why didn't you help that man? 

JOEY:
 uhh, cause, uhh, i'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. alright, look, i got to tell you something. 

 no, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. you don't have to explain yourself to me. ooh, who am i to question the great dr. drake remore? 

JOEY:
 but that's what... 

 i should just be happy to be near you. 

JOEY:
 hey i-  

 hey what? 

JOEY:
 that's it, just hey. like at the end of a dance, hey!  hey. he-hey.   

PHOEBE:
  when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . but don't. cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody that's another thing that you don't wanna do. 

MONICA:
 excellent! 

CHANDLER:
 very informative! 

RACHEL:
 not at all inappropriate! 

PHOEBE:
 thank you for coming everybody. there're cookies in the back. 

 that was great, the kids loved you. 

PHOEBE:
 yay, i rock. 

 and you know why? because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.you were incredible. 

PHOEBE:
 but. 

 how did you know there was a but? 

PHOEBE:
 i sense these things. it was either but or butter. 

 the thing is, i think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals. 

PHOEBE:
 i can do that. 

 really? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. 

 because that would be fantastic. what? you wanna kiss me? 

PHOEBE:
 thinkin' about it.   

 ahh, the bat. ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. 

ROSS:
 buddy, my monkey? 

 oh, yeah, right. there was a break-in, few months back, inside job. your monkey was taken. 

ROSS:
 oh my god. but the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. 

 the zoo! do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? 

ROSS:
 that, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. 

 of course they're gonna say he's dead. they don't want the bad publicity. it's all a great big cover-up. do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? 

ROSS:
 that guy lipson? 

 lipson knows. do you have any idea who else knows? 

ROSS:
 no, i, i only know lipson. 

 hmm, lipson knows huh? ahh, hello mr. opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with... 

ROSS:
 buddy, my monkey, my monkey. 

 word on the street - well, when i say street, i mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. 

ROSS:
 of course. 

 your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. that's all i know. 

ROSS:
 this is unbelievable. 

 so, what is this information worth to you, my friend? 

ROSS:
 are you trying to get me to bribe you? 

 maybe. 

ROSS:
 but you already told me everything.   

ROSS:
 check it out, he actually is the monkeyshine monkey. 

RACHEL:
 well, so what're you gonna do? 

ROSS:
 well, i guess i'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is. 

CHANDLER:
 that's what i did when i lost my clydesdales. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, hi again. 

 hi phoebe. 

PHOEBE:
 today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.  oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, and that's how we get hamburgers. nooowww, chickens!    

 you're the only one who can save her drake. 

 damnit, i'm a doctor, i'm not god. 

ROSS:
 well, there goes my whole belief system.

JOEY:
 oh my god, quick turn off the tv. 

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:

 oh my god. do the people at the hospital know about this? 

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 that's right, he's not drake, he's hans remore, drake's evil twin. 

 is this true? 

RACHEL:
 yes, yes it is true. and i know this because, because he pretended to be drake to, to sleep with me.  

MONICA:
 and then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.   

CHANDLER:
 and you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.  

 is all this true? 

JOEY:
 yes, i'm afraid it is. you deserve much better than me erica. you deserve to be with the real drake, he's the one you fell in love with. go to salem, find him, he's the guy for you. 

 oh hans.  

ROSS:

 i'll never forget you hans.  

JOEY:
 ok, alright, the people who threw the water.   

PHOEBE:

 the library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs. 

PHOEBE:
 i can't believe it. did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth? 

 no. 

PHOEBE:
 i see. 

 maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs. 

PHOEBE:
 no. what do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur? 

 i'm not saying you have to be barney. 

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 oh, right, well yeah, i graduated fourth grade and realized i wasn't a pimp. 

 remember the class play? you, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants. 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. 

RACHEL:

 you don't think i'm cute? 

RACHEL:
 i, i don't know, um, do you think you're cute? ok, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. um, i was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. so what should i tell her? 

 you can tell her i think her friend is cute.   

CHANDLER:
 no, stephen hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, david stein was the guy who had no elbows. 

 ok, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating? 

CHANDLER:
 ok that's not what he was doing. alright, he was looking for his bus money.   

 oh that's me, i gotta go. 

CHANDLER:
 oh uh, o, ok. 

 um, so listen, how many times am i gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date. 

CHANDLER:
 well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say ernie's, 8 o'clock. 

 i'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time i'll get to see your underwear. 

CHANDLER:
 no one was around to hear that?   

MONICA:
 so what'd he say? 

RACHEL:
 agh, what a jerk. i kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. i mean, naturally, you know, i said no. 

MONICA:
 well, thanks anyway. 

RACHEL:
 he just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking. 

MONICA:
 rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do... 

RACHEL:
 jean-claude she said yes, i'll see you tonight. thank you.   

RACHEL:
 and then jean-claude took me to that place crossroads and that's where we hung out with drew barrymore. 

JOEY:
 oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh. 

RACHEL:
 does anybody need anything? 

MONICA:
 oh, i'll have an espresso. oh acutally, i'll get it. if i ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself. 

RACHEL:
 that is so unfair. 

PHOEBE:
 i know. oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with van damme.   

ROSS:
 hey joey i have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was marcel's trainer. he's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours. 

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.   

CHANDLER:
 hey, stick a fork in me, i am done. 

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 like, when you're cooking a steak. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, ok, i don't eat meat. 

CHANDLER:
 well then, how do you know when vegetables are done? 

PHOEBE:
 well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell. 

CHANDLER:
 ok, then, eat me, i'm done. 

CHANDLER:
 i've met the perfect woman. ok, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'do you ever want to do it in an elevator?' 

MONICA:
 what did you say? 

CHANDLER:
 ahh, i believe my exact words were, 'flaign,en - sten'. i mean i didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, you just know.   

 oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes. 

CHANDLER:
 oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what i had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops. 

 oh, 200 seconds of passion. we gotta go. 

 but um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear? 

CHANDLER:
 well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my aunt edna's, and there were three of us in there. 

 well i was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner. 

CHANDLER:
 you want me to wear your panties? 

 could ya? 

CHANDLER:
 well, if i was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . you're swell.   

ROSS:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 alright monica, if there is something that you would like to share... 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 i did not sell you out. 

MONICA:
 yes you did. absolutely. 

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 uh-huh. 

RACHEL:
 you want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? that's what you want? 

MONICA:
 ok. 

RACHEL:
 oh that's what you want. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 this is so wild. ya know, i gotta admit, i was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date. 

 normally, i would not do it. 

MONICA:
 well, what made you make the exception for me? 

 'cause rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, drew barrymore. by the way, drew has some groundrules and...    

MONICA:
 say you're sorry.

 well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? 

CHANDLER:
 ok, well that's the part where i'm a wank. but i was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.  hundred times, i promise i will never take it off my. . .   wrist. but if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 the spoon. you licked and-and you put. you licked and you put. 

JOEY:
 yeah, so. 

CHANDLER:
 well don't you see how gross that is? i mean that's like you using my toothbrush.  

JOEY:
 well, that was only 'cause i used the red one to unclog the drain. 

CHANDLER:
 mine is the red one! oh god. can open, worms everywhere. 

JOEY:
 hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap? 

CHANDLER:
 because soap is soap. it's self-cleaning. 

JOEY:
 alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing i wash and the first thing you wash.  opening titles    

CHANDLER:
 hey. 

 hey. 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 okey-doke. 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos? 

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 wow, this is wild. what're you gonna get? 

PHOEBE:
 um, i'm getting a lily for my mom. 'cause her name's lily. 

CHANDLER:
 wow, that's lucky. what if her name was big ugly splotch? 

JOEY:
 so where you gettin' it? 

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 what? what's on your shoulder? 

PHOEBE:
 um, a chip. a tattoo, i'm getting a tattoo. 

ROSS:
 a tattoo? why, why would you want to do that?  

RACHEL:
 hi. well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool? 

ROSS:
 no, sorry i don't. tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? what if it doesn't come out right phoebe? then it's like, i don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. why's everyone staring at me? 

MONICA:
 ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. rich is gonna be here any minute. 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 yeah. it's my dad's birthday, i decided to give him a stroke. 

PHOEBE:
 no, i think you should tell them. 

MONICA:
 no, i don't even know how serious he is about me. until i do, i'm not telling them anything. 

ROSS:
 i don't know, i don't think mom and dad would mind. remember when you were 9 and richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'god i hope they get together.'    

ROSS:
 alright, shall we? 

MONICA:
 ok, wait, wait, wait, wait. you know what? ross, let's - let's switch places. you get in the middle. no un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. 

ROSS:
 monica, monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.  

 oh hi kids. hi darling. 

MONICA:
 happy birthday dad. 

 oh thank you. 

ROSS:
 hi ma. 

 happy birthday. 

 well, you kids thank dr. burke for the ride? 

ROSS:
 uh, actually mom, i think monica thanked him for the both of us.    

 well, you kids take the train in? 

 no, richard burke gave them a ride. 

 oh. speaking of whom, i hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.  

MONICA:
 finger cramp. oh god, sorry. here, let me get that mom. 

 sooo, richard's shopping in the junior section. 

MONICA:
 are we still on that? 

 we just know she's got the iq of a napkin. 

 she's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.    

JOEY:
 can you believe this place? 

CHANDLER:
 i know, this is a great apartment. 

JOEY:
 ah, i was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. so when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the rockettes. 

CHANDLER:
 wow, there's my fantasy come true. no, seriously. 

 hey. 

JOEY:
 hey! we were just sayin', great apartment man. 

 thanks. you want it? 

JOEY:
 huh? 

 yeah, i'm movin' to a bigger place. you should definitely take this one. 

JOEY:
 yeah, can you see me in a place like this? 

 why not? you hate park views and high ceilings? c'mon i'll show you the kitchen. 

CHANDLER:
  on tv. stop talking. ok.    

 c'mon, tell us. 

 yeah, is she really 20. 

 i am not telling you guys anything. 

 c'mon rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously. 

ROSS:
 dad, you really don't want to do that. 

 ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends? 

 jack, would you let it go? 

 look, i know what you're going through. when i turned 50 i got the porsche. you... you got your own little speedster. 

 guys. seriously, it is not like that. 

 tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and i cou. . . 

ROSS:
 dad, i beg you not to finish that sentence. 

 what? i'm kidding. you know i'd never let him touch the porsche.   

PHOEBE:
 ok rach, which, which lily? this lily or that lily? 

RACHEL:
 well i. . . 

PHOEBE:
 i like this lily. it's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. she had a more open, giving spirit. ooh, foghorn leghorn, ooh. 

 alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me. 

PHOEBE:
 here we go. 

RACHEL:
  

PHOEBE:
 you're not going? 

RACHEL:
 uh-huh. 

PHOEBE:
 what? is it - is this 'cause of what ross said? 

RACHEL:
 no. well, yeah, maybe. 

PHOEBE:
 i don't believe this. is this how this relationship's gonna work? ross equals boss. i mean, c'mon what is this, 1922? 

RACHEL:
 what's 1922? 

PHOEBE:
 just, you know, long time ago. well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. and then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. do you want to get this tattoo? 

RACHEL:
 yes i do, it's just that ross is. . . 

PHOEBE:
 ok, hey, hey. is your boyfriend the boss of you? 

RACHEL:
 no. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, who is the boss of you?!! 

RACHEL:
 you? 

PHOEBE:
 no. you are the boss of you. now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. go!!   

 how ya doin'? 

MONICA:
 i'm a twinkie. 

 really? i'm a hero. 

MONICA:
 oh, this is so hard. 

 yeah, i know. i hate it too. look, maybe we should just tell them. 

MONICA:
 maybe we should just tell your parents first. 

 my parents are dead. 

MONICA:
 god, you are so lucky. i mean, i mean. . . you know what i mean. 

 i know, i know. just hang in there, ok. ok, i'll go out first, alright. 

MONICA:
 alright. 

   judy, going to the bathroom, good for you. 

 thank you richard, i appreciate the support.    

 honey. honey, have you seen my harmon kilerbrew bat? bob doesn't believe i have one. 

 i have no idea. did you know richard has a twinkie in the city? 

 i know. he's like a new man. it's like a scene from cocoon. 

 i just never would have pictured richard with a bimbo. 

 apparently, he told johnny shapiro that she's quite a girl. in fact, he told johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her. 

 really. 

 i tell you, i've never seen him this happy. 

 so jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model? 

 of course not. with you it's like i've got two 25-year-olds. 

  

 c'mon, it's my birthday.    

JOEY:
 can we drop this? i am not interested in the guy's apartment. 

CHANDLER:
 oh please, i saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. you want it. 

JOEY:
 why would i want another apartment, huh? i've already got an apartment that i love. 

CHANDLER:
 well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while. 

JOEY:
 alright, you want the truth? i'm thinkin' about it. 

CHANDLER:
 what? 

JOEY:
 i'm sorry. i'm 28 years old, i've never lived alone, and i'm finally at a place where i've got enough money that i don't need a roommate anymore. 

CHANDLER:
 woah, woah, woah. i don't need a roommate either, ok? i can afford to live here by myself. ya know, i may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. 

JOEY:
 what're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? it's not like we agreed to live together forever. we're not bert and ernie. 

CHANDLER:
 look, you know what? if this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. 

JOEY:
 well that's how i feel. 

CHANDLER:
 well then maybe you should take it. 

JOEY:
 well then maybe i will. 

CHANDLER:
 fine with me. 

JOEY:
 great. then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.    

 who's drink can i freshen? 

 almost time for cake. 

ROSS:

MONICA:
 well, actually, i'm already seeing someone. 

 oh? 

 oh? 

ROSS:
 ohh. 

 she never tells us anything. ross, did you know monica's seeing someone? 

ROSS:

 so, who's the mystery man? 

MONICA:
 well, uh, he's a doctor.

MONICA:

MONICA:
 mom, it's ok. 

 it is judy. 

 jack. could you come in here for a moment? now! 

  

ROSS:
 i'll take that dad.  

 it seems your daughter and richard are something of an item. 

 that's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city. 

MONICA:
 dad, i'm the twinkie. 

 you're the twinkie? 

 she's not a twinkie. 

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 i'm movin' out like we talked about. 

CHANDLER:
 well i didn't think that was serious.  that was just a fight. 

JOEY:
 well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. about how i never lived alone or anything. i just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever. 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 no. no way, i'm not signing that. 

 i don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show. 

JOEY:
 how can they do this to me? 

 er, uh, i'm just gonna go. sorry.    

 well it wasn't that many guys. i mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage. 

RACHEL:
 hey, it's not that big a deal, i was just curious. 

ROSS:
 g'night. 

 night richard. good luck mon. 

 alright, before i tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with. 

 two. 

MONICA:
 two? two? how is that possible? i mean, have you seen you? 

 well, i mean what can i say? i, i was married to barbara for 30 years. she was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two. 

MONICA:
 two it is. ok, time for bed, i'm gonna go brush my teeth.  

 woah, woah, no wait a minute now. c'mon it's your turn. oh c'mon. ya know, i don't need the actual number, just a ballpark. 

MONICA:
 ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.   

RACHEL:
 wow, i am so glad i'm not monica right now. 

ROSS:
 tell me about it. so what, what's your magic number? 

RACHEL:
 uhhhooo. 

 c'mon, you know everyone i've been with. all, both of them. 

 well, there's you. 

ROSS:
 better not be doin' these in order. 

RACHEL:
 ok, uh, billy dreskin, pete carney, barry, and uh, oh, paolo. 

ROSS:
 oh yes, the weenie from torrini. 

RACHEL:
 oh honey, are you jealous of paolo? oh, c'mon, i'm so much happier with you than i ever was with him. 

ROSS:
 really? 

 oh please. that paolo thing was barely a relationship. all it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.   

CHANDLER:
 eddie, i didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend. 

 that's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say. 

CHANDLER:
 this is nuts. this is crazy. she came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story. 

 where's buddy? 

CHANDLER:
 buddy? 

 my fish, buddy. 

CHANDLER:
 there was no fish when she dropped it off. 

 oh, this is, this is unbelievable. i mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my buddy? 

 hey i didn't kill your fish. look eddie...  would you look at what i'm doin' here. that can't be smart. so we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in mr. pocket. tangellon?     

 that's it? that's the giant number you were afraid to tell me? 

MONICA:
 well yeah. 

 well, that's not bad at all. i mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet. 

MONICA:
 you really ok with it? 

 oh honey, i'm fine. 

MONICA:
 oh, yay. ok about that two. 

 what? alright, what about my two? 

MONICA:
 well, it just seems like a really small number. 

 right, and... 

MONICA:
 and, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? or is that what you're doing with me? oh my god, am i an oat? 

 honey, you are not an oat. i, i mean i don't know, i, i guess i'm just not an oat guy. i've only slept with women i've been in love with. 

MONICA:
 but you've only slept with two people. 

 right. 

MONICA:
 wow. oh wow. you know i love you too, right. 

 now i do.    

 ross, ross, please listen to me. ross, you are so much better for me than paolo ever was. i mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh. 

ROSS:
 oh, hey, if i make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and i'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes. 

RACHEL:
 god, ross, look, what you and i have is special, all paolo and i ever had was... 

 animal sex, animal sex? so what're you saying, i mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. i mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex? 

RACHEL:
 ok, ross, try to hear me. ok, i, hey, i'm not gonna lie to you. ok, it was good with paolo. 

ROSS:
 knock-knock. 

RACHEL:
 but, what you and i have is so much better. ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. ya know, i swear, this is the best i have ever had. 

ROSS:
 until now.    

RACHEL:
 oh, hi. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 so, when i woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes. 

MONICA:
 why? 

CHANDLER:
 because he thinks i slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. 

 why would you kill his fish? 

CHANDLER:
 because sometimes, phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish. 

RACHEL:
 chandler honey, i'm sorry. ok, can we watch joey's show now please?   

ROSS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 men just take out wind? 

PHOEBE:
 ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers. 

RACHEL:
 wow. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like the hobbit. 

MONICA:
 it is nothing like the hobbit. it's like reading about every relationship i've ever had, except for richard. 

 oh yes, no, richard would never steal your wind. 

MONICA:
 no. 

PHOEBE:
 no, 'cause he's yummy. 

MONICA:
 yes. but all the other ones. 

PHOEBE:
 oh yes. oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but god forbid we should take a sip. 

JOEY:
 anybody want a croan. 

 ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. right there, it's like, um, 'hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'   

 don't worry about it already. things happen. 

JOEY:
 so, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything? 

 joey, look at me, look at me. do i have lipstick on my teeth?

JOEY:
 but i was dr. drake remoray. how can i go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab? 

 things change, roll with em. 

JOEY:
 but this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. i'm not gonna do this. 

 joey, i'm gonna tell you the same thing i told al minser and his pyramid of dogs. take any job you can get and don't make on the floor. 

JOEY:
 i'm sorry. see ya.    

RACHEL:
 oh, god, oh, god, i mean it's just so. 

MONICA:
 isn't it. 

 uhh, i mean this is like reading about my own life. i mean this book could have been called 'be your own windkeeper rachel'. 

PHOEBE:
 i don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you. 

ROSS:
 hey you guys. 

MONICA:
 hey. 

ROSS:
 uh, sweetie we've gotta go. 

RACHEL:
 no! 

ROSS:
 no? 

 no, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table? 

ROSS:
 actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. so you don't miss the beginning. 

RACHEL:
 no, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind. 

 you go girl. i can't pull that off can i? 

ROSS:
 excuse me, your, your, your wind? 

 yes, my wind. how do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow? 

ROSS:
 you, you know i, i don't, have a- have a problem with that. 

RACHEL:
 ok, i just, i just really need to be with myself right now. i'm sorry. 

PHOEBE:
 um-um, um-um. 

RACHEL:
 you're right, i don't have to apologize. sorry. damnit!   

JOEY:
 what is it? 

 i, i don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. i mean, i don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it. 

JOEY:
 see, this is why i don't date women who read. uh-oh. 

 what, what's that? 

JOEY:
 it's my visa bill. envelope one of two. that can't be good. 

ROSS:
 open it, open in. 

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 that's a two line part. 

 joey, you owe $1100 at i love lucite. 

JOEY:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 look, i'm not being any of those things, ok, i'm just being realistic. 

JOEY:
 well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend. 

ROSS:
 i am your friend. 

 well then tell me things like, 'joey you'll be fine,' and, 'hang in there,' and, and, 'somethin' big's fonna come along, i know it.' 

ROSS:
 but i don't know it. what i do know is that you owe $2300 at isn't it chromantic. 

JOEY:
 hey ross, i'm aware of what i owe. 

ROSS:
 ok, well then get some sense. i mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another. 

JOEY:
 look, i don't wanna hear this right now. 

ROSS:
 huh, i'm just saying... 

JOEY:
 well don't just say. 

ROSS:
 ya know, maybe, maybe i should just go. 

JOEY:
 ok. 

ROSS:
 ok. i'll see ya later. just think about it, ok. 

JOEY:
 i don't need to think about it. i was dr. drake remoray. that was huge. big things are gonna happen, you'll see. ross, you still there?

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 look eddie, aren't you forgetting anything? 

 oh yeah, that's right, look i got us a new goldfish. he's a lot fiestier that the last one. 

CHANDLER:
 maybe 'cause the last one was made by pepperidge farm. look eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now? 

 well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now i'm a dehydrating maniac! 

CHANDLER:
 look you have to help me out here. i thought we had a deal. i thought by the time... 

 ah-ah-ah, you know what that is? 

CHANDLER:

 that's a tomato. this one definitely goes in the display.   

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:

 daaahhhh! 

MONICA:
 aaahhhhhhh! aaahhhh! 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

 i uh, i gotta tell you man, i mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, i mean don't you think? 

CHANDLER:

 excuse me, that's 50 bucks. 

JOEY:
 what? 

 five oh dollars. 

JOEY:
 ohh, you know what it is? it's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. now when i was on days of our lives as dr. drake remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.  

 that's great. 

 and, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', i could attend to the victims 'cause i have a background in medical acting. 

 ok, listen, thanks for coming in. 

JOEY:
 no no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. uh, at least let me finish. uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. you were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. i'll have a good day.      

 ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? i would have to say no.

PHOEBE:

 that's not the end. 

PHOEBE:
 yu-huh. that's when my mother would shut off the tv and say 'the end'. 

MONICA:
 what about the part where he has rabies? 

PHOEBE:
 he doesn't have rabies, he has babies. that's what my mom said.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ross can't go so it's between my friend eric prower who has breath issues and dan with the poking.  you want some more beer? is that spike lee?' 

 ok.  

JOEY:
 ok, uh, hey richard, if you had an extra ticket to the knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?

CHANDLER:
 ok, that's eric. 

 glad to be of help. matches.  

MONICA:
 i meant, why don't you take richard to the game? what? 

JOEY:
 i don't know. 

MONICA:
 c'mon. keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh. 

 i don't know, richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old   -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings. 

MONICA:
 so what, he's a little older, big deal, i mean he's important to me. ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his jag.  

 how do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car? 

CHANDLER:
 ok, this could be tough. 

JOEY:
  he takes the jaguar. 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 ross. 

ROSS:
 yeah. 

 look.   joey, do you know we can see you from here? 

 how come richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? 

ROSS:
 well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula. 

MONICA:
 you know what, i think it's cute, you trying to be more like richard. 

JOEY:
 not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.   

 look it's the artist formerly known as chandler. 

CHANDLER:
 just tryin' somethin' here, ya know. 

 so joey, why didn't you grow a moustache? 

JOEY:
 oh we flipped for it. i got the cigar, he got the moustache. figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. 

ROSS:
 yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. 

CHANDLER:
 hey listen, we've gotta go, i promised richard we'd meet him downstairs. 

MONICA:
 you're meeting richard? 

JOEY:
 yeah, we're goin' to a ranger game. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, didn't he tell ya? 

MONICA:
 well, he told me he was going out with the guys, i just didn't know that you were the guys. 

CHANDLER:
 you hear that? we're the guys. 

JOEY:
 we're the guys. 

MONICA:
 with that moustache doesn't chandler remind you of aunt sylvia? 

ROSS:
 thank you.   

 hi, we're visitiing. it's ben and his da-da. da-da. can you say da-da? look, i'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try. 

RACHEL:
 no luck huh? 

ROSS:
 naa. a while ago i got a sah out of him, which i thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause i, i gotta take this off. 

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah sure, ok.  

 what're you doing? 

RACHEL:
 uh, i'm holding ben. 

ROSS:
 yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb. 

RACHEL:
 ok. 

 well just hold him like you'd hold a football. 

RACHEL:
 this is how i would hold a football. 

ROSS:
 ok, here, here. there we go. 

RACHEL:
 ok, i'm sorry, i'm just not very good with babies. i mean i haven't been around them, i mean, you know, since i was one. 

ROSS:
 it's alright, it's no big deal. 

RACHEL:
 really? 

ROSS:
 yeah, definitely, i'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. 

RACHEL:
 what? 

ROSS:
 what? 

RACHEL:
 you think about stuff like that? 

ROSS:
 uhh, yeah. i mean, actually i kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. 

RACHEL:
 two, two babies? 

ROSS:
 yeah. ya know, a boy and a girl. hopefully the girl will come first so ben here won't feel too competitive. 

RACHEL:
 then what's gonna happen? 

ROSS:
 well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, scarsdale. 

RACHEL:
 uh-huh. 

ROSS:
 yeah, that way i figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. and yes, i know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. 

RACHEL:
 wow. wow, that's great. great. ok, wow, you know what. 

ROSS:
 huh? 

RACHEL:
 i'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this  gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. ok. oh look at that, i don't have a pot. i don't have a pot. well, hey, maybe i've got one at home, or in scarsdale. hey is that a door?    

PHOEBE:
 hey. 

 hey phoebs, what's happening? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the andes. 

MONICA:
 so you watched the movies huh? 

PHOEBE:
 uh huh, what is happening to the world? i mean, no no no, 'cause et leaves, and and rocky loses, charlotte dies. 

 charlotte who? 

PHOEBE:
 with the web, the spider she dies, she does. she has babies and dies. it's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud. 

MONICA:
 alright, you wanna feel better? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. 

MONICA:
 ok, here, watch this. 

 it's a wonderful life. yes i've heard of this. 

MONICA:
 so you can't lose, it's there in the title. wonderfullness is baked right in. 

PHOEBE:
 please, i almost fell for that with, uh, pride of the yankees, i thought i was gonna see a film about yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets lou gehrig's disease. 

 uh, the guy was lou gehrig. didn't you kinda see it coming? 

PHOEBE:
 phoebe, just watch that, i promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. 

  

 hey, be right there. 

MONICA:
 there's a game? 

CHANDLER:
 uh, yeah, i just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. bring your nerves of steel. 

 it's the basketball playoffs. 

MONICA:
 listen, um honey, i appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, i mean, they have each other. 

 oh, no, honey, i mean, don't worry, i like hanging out with those guys. it's fun for me. they're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'you know who just died shoveling snow?' 

 alright that's great, then just go. go knicks. 

 uh, it's the college playoffs. 

MONICA:
 oh, then go vassar. 

 uh, they're not in it. 

MONICA:
 ok, then just go. 

 ok.  

MONICA:
 oh, why does this bother me so much? i mean i don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them. 

PHOEBE:
 sure. 

 it's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and i don't know, what do i do? 

PHOEBE:
 does it matter? you're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off. 

RACHEL:
  

PHOEBE:
 me too.  

MONICA:
 i've got a question. richard made plans again with the guys. 

RACHEL:
 yeah well, ross just made plans for the whole century. 

 ya know what, i think i'm gonna go to my room and read cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. know what, at least maybe i can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover cristmas candles. 

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 i don't know, you tell me. one minute i'm holding ben like a football, the next thing i know, i've got two kids, i'm living in scarsdale complaining about the taxes. 

 well i'm sorry, i think about stuff. ya know, i mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders. 

RACHEL:
 ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. 

ROSS:
 c'mon, what, you never think about our future? 

 yes, but i, i think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next saturday night. i do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. you know what our childrens names are gonna be. 

ROSS:
 no, no, i mean, ya know, i, i read a book and there was a girl named emily and i thought, i thought that might be good. 

RACHEL:
 what was the book? 

ROSS:
 the big book of childrens' names. 

RACHEL:
 ok, ross, ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. 

ROSS:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 but i do not want to have everything decided for me. i spent my whole life like that. it's what i had with barry, that was one of the reasons i left. i, i like not knowing right now and i'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that. 

ROSS:
 ok fine. 

RACHEL:
 thank you. 

ROSS:
 we're not done. 

RACHEL:
 i didn't know that. 

 ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that. 

RACHEL:
 fine, i will. 

ROSS:
 good, 'cause i love you. 

RACHEL:
 oh yeah. 

ROSS:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 well i love you too. 

ROSS:
 well that's the first time we've said that. 

RACHEL:
 yes it is. 

ROSS:
 well, i'm gonna kiss you. 

RACHEL:
 well you better.   

 hey. oh thanks for the great movie tip. 

MONICA:
 did you like it? 

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah. you know, i don't know if i was happier when um george bailey destroyed the family business or um, donna reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed. 

MONICA:
 alright, i'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful? 

 i didn't watch the ending, i was too depressed. it just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "it's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."    

CHANDLER:
 kick save and... denied. 

 but... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... bam! yes! could that shot be any prettier? 

JOEY:
 man you are incredible. 

 well, we had a table in college. 

CHANDLER:
 oh really, i didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's. 

 nice moustache by the way. when puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in. 

MONICA:
  table. 

 ok, just one more point. 

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 see, that's why we don't let her play. 

 is everything all right? 

MONICA:
 um-hmm. 

 uh-oh. 

CHANDLER:
 oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. i'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time. 

JOEY:
 yeah, he's just really great to hang around with. 

 well. 

 no no, seriously, chandler and i were just talkin about this. he is so much cooler than our dads.  you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but richard is just- ow, ow. what are you kickin me for? huh? i'm tryin to talk here. 

 uh, you guys see me as a dad? 

JOEY:
 oh yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 no. 

JOEY:
 nooooo. 

 your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. see, when we say dad, we mean buddy. we mean pal. 

 uh-huh, yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 no no, seriously, joey's my dad, monica's my dad. i've even got some dads down at work. 

 that's fine. well, your other dad and i are gonna go have a romantic evening and i guess i'll just see you kids around. 

MONICA:
 nighty-nite. 

CHANDLER:
 you're not a dad. you're not a dad. 

JOEY:
 not a dad. 

CHANDLER:
 i can't believe you got us into trouble.   

MONICA:
  

 yeah, just, i feel like i'm about a hundred. i thought i was just one of the guys. 

MONICA:
 come here. i'll make you feel like one of the guys. you know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball. 

 what're you talkin' about, i was killin' 'em. 

MONICA:
 yeah, well they suck too.   

 ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail. 

RACHEL:
 ok ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter. 

ROSS:
  

 it's us. 

ROSS:
 come on up. i'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.  

RACHEL:
 ok, we can do this now, can't we ben? yes we can, yes we can.   there. i did it. i did it. look at that, oh, stays on and everything. hi.

ROSS:

MONICA:
 'cause i was going by it the other day and i saw that there was a stock with my initials, meg, on it and, well, sometimes i have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting. 

RACHEL:
 ok honey, you really need a job. 

ROSS:
 mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview. 

MONICA:
 really. 

 ok, right there. that, that's the third sign today. right there. 

ROSS:
 on behalf of everyone, i'd just like to say behuh. 

 no, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere i go today i keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. like when i was walking over here and i passed a buffet...which is my father's last name. 

 ahh. 

PHOEBE:
 and they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. and there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken. 

MONICA:
 his indian name? 

PHOEBE:
 no because i chickened out the last time when i tried to meet him. so i mean coincidences? i don't think so. 

ROSS:
 freakish. 

MONICA:
 wow. 

JOEY:
 freaky. 

MONICA:
 weird, weird. 

 ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger? 

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 ok, ok, you know what? i think you're very funny. kudos on that hat joke. but, come on guy just, just give him back the hat. 

 why should we? 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 stop talking, stop talking now. let me just get this straight. you're actually stealing my hat?

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

 monica, relax, go get a beer. 

MONICA:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

 hey, i made $17 before breakfast, what have you done? 

JOEY:
 well uh, i had breakfast here so technically i saved $3.50. 

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 well, my financially challenged friends,  i split my money and i bought some shares of chp and zxy. 

JOEY:
 how come those? 

MONICA:
 well, chp because i used to have a crush on eric estrada. and zxy becuase i think it sounds zexy. 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 hey phoebs, if you want, i'll do it. 

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
  

PHOEBE:
 so talk to her. 

  dog is. i want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. uh, goodbye.  

RACHEL:

JOEY:
     

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

 yeah, he loved stilts. one time i was upstairs, i was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden i look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. he just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts. 

PHOEBE:
 wow.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

 ok, nothing from the neck up.  down. dana's ovulating. 

 oh really, you guys tryin' again?

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 so, i'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's rachel's birthday, i mean, we want it to be special, i thought i'd poach a salmon. 

 ohhh. 

MONICA:
 what? 

 question. why do we always have to have parties where you poach things? 

MONICA:
 you wanna be in charge of the food committee? 

ROSS:
 question two. why do we always have to have parties with committees? 

JOEY:
 really. why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? 

ROSS:
 yeah. 

 yeah, i agree. ya know, i think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and i'm just not sure we are. 

MONICA:
 alright. if you guys don't want it to be special, fine. you can throw any kind of party you want.   

 joey they're not real. i start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. see  

CHANDLER:
 wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.  opening titles    

ROSS:
 i talked to rachel's sisters, neither of them can come. 

MONICA:
 ok, um so, i still have to invite dillon and emma and shannon cooper. 

 woah, woah, woah, uh, no shannon cooper. 

PHOEBE:
 why not her? 

JOEY:
 cause she uh, she steals stuff. 

CHANDLER:
 or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and joey just slept with her and never called her back. 

MONICA:
 joey that is horriable. 

 hey i liked her, alright. maybe, maybe too much. i don't know i guess i just got scared. 

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, i didn't know. 

JOEY:
 i didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.   

 hi honey, how did it go? 

RACHEL:
 agh, it was the graduation from hell. 

CHANDLER:
 ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. 

 ya know, i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. my sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. it's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica. 

MONICA:
 so what happened? 

RACHEL:
 my parents happened. all they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. but nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them. but you know what, you know what the good news is? i get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. 

 ok, so i guess we don't invite her parents. 

MONICA:
 well, how bout just her mom? 

CHANDLER:
 why her mom? 

MONICA:
 cause i already invited her. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, ooh, did you ask stacy roth? 

JOEY:
 oh no, can't invite her. she also steals.    

PHOEBE:
 ok, here are the birthday candles. where's the birthday cake? 

MONICA:
 ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan. 

CHANDLER:
 excuse me? 

 it's a traditional mexican custard dessert. 

JOEY:
 oh that's nice. happy birthday rachel, here's some goo.   

MONICA:
  here? 

 what? the father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday? 

MONICA:
 no no, the father can, but um, since i am the roommate i can tell you that she's not here and i'll pass along the message, ok. so bye-bye. 

 ohhh, you're having a parteee. 

MONICA:
 no, no, not a party. just a surprise gathering of some people rachel knows. um, this is phoebe and chandler and joey. 

 i'll never remember all of that. so uh, what's the deal? rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it? 

CHANDLER:
 this isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?   

 hi monica.   

 chinese menu guy. forgot the menus. 

CHANDLER:
 so, basically just a chinese guy. 

JOEY:
 uh, hey, dr. greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on rachel's bed. 

 alright, that sounds like a two person job.  

 well, my goodness, what was that? 

MONICA:
 sandra, i am so sorry, i thought you were rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet. 

 you thought i was rachel? 

CHANDLER:
 yes because uh, you look so young. 

PHOEBE:
 and because you're both, you know, white women. 

 oh, i missed you kids. well, should i put my coat in the bedroom? 

CHANDLER:
 no! no, i'll take that for ya. 

 oh well thank you. such a gentleman. thank you.   ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...   the funniest thing happened to me on the way here. i was... 

PHOEBE:
  rest of it, ya know, but i really have to go to the bathroom so... hey, come with me. yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.  

MONICA:
 oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. 

 ok, think, what would jack and chrissy do? 

JOEY:
   oh, ok we can come back out in the living room. 

MONICA:
 so uh, joey and chanlder, i, i think it's time that you take dr. greene over to your place. 

CHANDLER:
 uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. why again? 

MONICA:
 because that's where the party is you goon. see this is just the staging area. 

JOEY:
 right this is staging. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area. 

JOEY:
   this is clearly in the wrong apartment.      

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:

 everything you've heard is true.   

MONICA:
 could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a boggle tournament.   

MONICA:
 you, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. and gunther! what are you doing here? 

 um  

PHOEBE:
  

MONICA:
 phoebe. 

PHOEBE:
 alright, i'm sorry but these people needed me. they work hard all week, it's saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. go. 

MONICA:
 ya know, my party is fun. i mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...     

RACHEL:
 you want me to see a therapist? 

 sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. you've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father. 

RACHEL:
 ok mom, you know what, fine, i'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, i gotta go, i gotta go do a thing.   

 did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. i felt like gulliver around that place. 

RACHEL:
 daddy, daddy, you know what, i really wanna hear more about this, i really do, but i just have, i just have to do a, some stuff.   

 you work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.   

 you work and you work and you work on a boat... 

 he always ridiculed my pottery classs... 

 ...and you sand it and you varnish it... 

 ...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs. 

 ...and her yoga and her bridges of madison county... 

 ...the scotch and the cigarettes... 

 ...and the bansai's and the chiuaua... 

 ...i may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but... 

 ...what the hell does she want with half a boat...   

CHANDLER:
  be skins. i'll be skins.  oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced i got a lot of tigers. got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, i even got a governor. 

 this is it, isn't it? i mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. my mom there, my dad there. thanksgiving, christmas. she gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. oh, chandler how did you get through this? 

CHANDLER:
 well, i relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed. 

 ya know, i just, so weird. i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july. 

CHANDLER:
 becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? 

RACHEL:
 it's just this thing. every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. my sister jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. but then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. it never occured to anybody to bring another one. and now it's just... 

CHANDLER:
 i, i know.    

MONICA:
 ok, thanks for coming, i hope you guys had fun. 

 alright, monica dear, i'm gonna hit the road. now i've left my 10 verbs on the table. and you be sure and send me that finished poem. 

MONICA:
 ok will do. so glad you came. 

 i think i saw rachel out in the hall. 

MONICA:
 ok, let me go check. your mom want's to say goodbye. 

RACHEL:
 oh ok. 

 happy birthday sweetie. 

RACHEL:
 ok.    

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 well, uh, dr. greene, where are you going? 

 to get my coat. 

 no no no. 

alright, alright, i can get my own coat.    

 sorry, we're on a major flan high. 

PHOEBE:
 oh no, you're not supposed to be here. this is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out.  or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe. 

 i have to be heading to my chateau, thank you. 

PHOEBE:
 oh all right, then i guess we're going back into the hallway. 

JOEY:
 thanks for coming mrs. greene.   well, ok, you take care. 

 oh, you kids  i've been to in years. 

MONICA:
 thank you.  closing credits    

 ok everybody, it's time for flan. 

CHANDLER:
 yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun. 

JOEY:
 kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection. 

MONICA:
 ok, that's enough. 

 ok rachel, make a special flan wish. 

 ok, chandler, mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.   

MONICA:
 oh, i ordered mine first. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, but i'm, i'm so much faster... 

MONICA:
 give it to me. 

CHANDLER:
 no. 

MONICA:
 give it to me. 

CHANDLER:
 ok, you can have it.  

  there you go, enjoy your coffee. 

CHANDLER:
 that was there when i got here.  

PHOEBE:
  

MONICA:
   quick, phoebe, tell us before he can swallow. 

PHOEBE:
 oh ok, ryan, that guy i went out with, who's in the navy.   

RACHEL:
 you went out with a guy in the navy? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i met him when i was playing guitar in washington square park. ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change. 

JOEY:
 hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man? 

PHOEBE:
 no. no, he is my submaring guy. he resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. only this time he's coming for two weeks. two whole weeks, which means yay. 

 so wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?   

MONICA:
 that'll teach you to lick my muffin. 

ROSS:
  

JOEY:
 oh no, what happened? 

ROSS:
 well, i just spoke to carol. ben's got the chicken pox. 

 oh no. 

ROSS:
 yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it. 

RACHEL:
 well i've had it. 

JOEY:
 yeah, i've had it. 

MONICA:
 had it. 

CHANDLER:
 had it. 

PHOEBE:
 well, i've never had it, i feel so left out.  look!  opening titles   

 honey, you made the bed again. i told you, you don't have to do that. this isn't camp. 

 ooh, then i guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. ok, i am going to take a shower and today i will be singing jim crochee's leroy brown.   

 monica...   hey mon, i have a question. is leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town? 

MONICA:
 baddest. otherwise the song would be fat fat leroy brown. 

 what're you doing? 

MONICA:
 just waiting for you sweetie. 

 are you remaking the bed? 

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you know what, the way you did it was just fine. 

 then, you're redoing it because... 

 if i tell you, you'll think i'm crazy. 

 you're pretty much running that risk either way. 

MONICA:
 ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner. 

 oh, well that's not so crazy. 

MONICA:
 i'm just easing you in. 

 oh, alright. 

MONICA:
 alright, you see these little flower blossoms? they should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. you don't love me any more do you. 

 actually, if it's possible, i love you more. 

 really? wow, well then come on, i wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.   

CHANDLER:
 hey, look joey, i'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, i can get you a job right here as an entry level processor. 

JOEY:
 but don't you need experience for a job like that? 

CHANDLER:
 it's not that hard to learn. and as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. act like a processor, people will think you're a processor. 

  

CHANDLER:
 hey thanks. scott alexander, joey tribbianni. joey is a uh, fellow processor. 

 no kidding. 

 oh yeah yeah. i process. people want the processing, i'm the one they call. 

 where do you work? 

JOEY:
 uhh, well, right now i'm in between things. you know how it is. one day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more. 

CHANDLER:
 i was just telling joey about the opening in fleischman's group. 

 fleischman's group. whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. ha-ha-ha... 

JOEY:
 ha-ha.    

RACHEL:
 oh, this lipstick looks just great on you. 

MONICA:
 you look fabulous honey, you really do. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah? are you sure, really.   

 you see, you look beautiful. for god sakes, dim the lights. 

PHOEBE:
 i, i, i'm hideous. 

 it's gonna be ok. ryan's been under water. he's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.   

PHOEBE:
 come in. 

 hey baby, i'm back...  

PHOEBE:
 hey ryan, what's up? 

 what's goin' on? 

 well, no no, you have to stay back. i, i have the pox. 

 chicken or small? 

PHOEBE:
 chicken. which is so ironic considering i'm a vegetarian. 

 why aren't you at home in bed? 

PHOEBE:
 'cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my god, i forgot how cute you are. 

 i'm sorry, i never had 'em. 

PHOEBE:
 ohh, ohh. 

 if i had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when i was 7, when jimmy hauser had the chicken pox. i would grab that kid and rub him all over my face. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, or you know, you could just wish that i didn't have them now. 

 can i please see your face? 

PHOEBE:
 nope. you don't want to see a face covered with pox. 

 your face could be covered with lochs, i wouldn't care. 

PHOEBE:
 and you hate fish. oh. that's so sweet, alright. ok, alright, you can see. this is me...   oh, i am scary. 

 sorry, the lightning. lightning was an unfortunate incidence. you look lovely, lovely. 

 i hate this. 'cause i tell you, i had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything i had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this. 

 phoebe, i have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. i am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.   

PHOEBE:
 ok, this is the most romantic disease i've ever had.   

JOEY:
 hey. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, how's the first day goin'? 

JOEY:
 pretty good. it's like you said. it's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column. 

CHANDLER:
 well there you go. 

JOEY:
 hey and everbody is so nice. i just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, jeannie. 

CHANDLER:
 jeannie, the head of east coast operations jeannie? 

 yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. small world huh? 

CHANDLER:
 weird world. your kids? 

 i figure my character has kids. 

CHANDLER:
 ya know there isn't a part of that sentence i don't need explained. 

 well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. my character, joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, ashley and brittany. ashley copies everything brittany does. 

CHANDLER:
 well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes. 

 yeah. joseph and his wife, karen, are thinking of having a third kid... ya know what? just did. 

CHANDLER:
 really? wow. that's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.   

 you know what makes the itching even worse? 

PHOEBE:
 that you don't stop talking about it. 

 fine. 

PHOEBE:
 let's just play, ok. good, ok.  here we go...  just getting ready to roll the dice... 

 what're you doing? are you scratching? 

PHOEBE:
 no. this is what i do for luck, ok. 

 you're scratching. give me the dice. 

PHOEBE:
 no. 

 give me the dice. 

PHOEBE:
 no. here.  

 we can't scratch. you know we can't, we'll scar. 

PHOEBE:
 uhh, i can't stop thinking about it. it's just so hard. i just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.  

 no. 

PHOEBE:
 give it. 

 no. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, come on. you know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.  

 oh god help me. 

PHOEBE:
 now do me, do my back. oh come on, harder.   

RACHEL:
 oh, stop that, stop that right now. 

ROSS:
 you know, i might have expected this of you phoebe, but ryan, you're a military man.   

JOEY:
 you and milton have to join us on the boat. karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it. 

 oh, that sounds lovely. we're gonna have to set that up. oh, i better get back. hope the baby feels better. 

JOEY:
 oh, thanks, thanks. bye bye jeannie. 

 bye bye joey. 

JOEY:
 what a phony. 

CHANDLER:
 well, i'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. hey mr. douglas. 

JOEY:
 sir. 

 uh, listen bing, i received your memo. so, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next friday? 

CHANDLER:
 well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families. 

 i have a family, i'm gonna be here. 

JOEY:
 yeah bing, what's that about? 

CHANDLER:
 it's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, i can get them to you by wednesday. 

 rough numbers? 

JOEY:
 this company was not built on rough numbers. am i right mr. douglas. 

 have the final numbers on my desk by tuesday. 

CHANDLER:
 uh, if you say so sir. 

JOEY:
 joseph's good, isn't he? 

CHANDLER:
 well, i'm going to kill you. 

JOEY:
 hey, hey, i just figure joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers. 

CHANDLER:
 why? 

JOEY:
 look, i'm sorry but that's what joseph does, ok. if you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'what're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.    

 ooh, duct tape. was i supposed to bring something too? 

MONICA:
 this is for the scratchy twins out there. i taped oven mits to their hands. 

 you're strict. 

MONICA:
 it's for their own good. 

 you know, i like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. see in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time. 

 exactly. oh, i love that i can be totally neurotic around you now. tell me the truth. don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular? 

 if it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle. 

MONICA:
 very good. 

 thank you. 

MONICA:
 you know what. tomorrow i'm gonna do your clocks. 

 you're gonna do what to my clocks. 

MONICA:
 i'm gonna set them to my time. 

 well, i'm confused. i thought we shared time. 

 no no. see, in my bedroom i set my clock six minutes fast. you wanna know why? 

 because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen. 

MONICA:
 no forget it, i'm not gonna tell you now. 

 no come on. come on tell me. 

MONICA:
 no. see you don't understand. 

 come on. 

MONICA:
 no. you don't have any of these cute little obsessive things. 

 no that's not true. that is not true. 

MONICA:
 oh yeah. 

 yeah. 

MONICA:
 alright, well tell me one of yours. 

 ok. ahh. one of my things is, i always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks. 

MONICA:
 what if they get mixed up? 

 boy i would just uh, i would freak out. 

 you would not. i can't believe this. i hate this, you're too normal. i can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. 

 see, if anyone overheard that, i didn't come off well.   and a pen in the other. joey walks in, waking up chandler who covers by pretending to  

JOEY:
 hey. mr. douglas is looking for you. 

CHANDLER:
 why? wh- wh- why is mr. douglas looking for me? 

JOEY:
 'cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the lender project. 

CHANDLER:
 wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that? 

JOEY:
 becasue at first he thought it was joseph. but after he asked joseph about it, turns out it was you. anyway, i just thought you should know. 

CHANDLER:
 alright, that's it. look joey, i'm sorry, i realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if i could just fire joseph, i would, but unfortunately that's not possible so i'm gonna have to let both of you go. 

JOEY:
 what're you talking about, everybody loves joseph. 

CHANDLER:
 i don't, i hate joseph, ok. i think he's a brown-nosing suck up. 

JOEY:
 oh yeah. well you can't fire joseph. you know why, 'cause he's not in your department. 

CHANDLER:
 alright, ok, alright. so i can't fire joseph but uh, i can sleep with his wife. 

JOEY:
 karen. 

 yeah, karen. i'm thinking about having an affair with her. oh, you know what? i just did. 

JOEY:
 ahh. what the hell are you doing to me man. 

 oh well it's not me, it's my character, chandy. yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. in fact, i have her panties right there in my drawer. 

JOEY:
 really? 

CHANDLER:
 no freakshow, she's fictional. 

JOEY:
 take it easy. if it means that much to you, i'll uh, i'll go find something else. 

CHANDLER:
 thank you. 

JOEY:
 it's just that, i, i'm gonna miss joseph. i liked him. his wife, she was hot.     

PHOEBE:
 can i please take these off? i swear i won't scratch. 

RACHEL:
 no sorry hon, monica's orders. 

  easy. 

ROSS:
 ok, dinner's on. 

RACHEL:
 and there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you. 

ROSS:
 alright you kids, bye now. 

 bye.  

 oh look, a low budget puppet show. 

PHOEBE:
 it's such a shame you can't see which finger i'm holding up.   

 wine? 

PHOEBE:

 oh, i spilled some. 

PHOEBE:
 i got it.  

  

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 oh.    

PHOEBE:
 you know what, that's it, that's it.        

 monica, wake up. monica. 

MONICA:

 i thought of a thing. 

MONICA:
 yeah? 

 yeah. i have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed. 

MONICA:
 no honey. you have to sleep on this side of the bed because i have to sleep on this side of the bed. 

 or so i would have you believe. 

MONICA:
 no. big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed. 

 hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet. 

MONICA:
 alright, go on. 

 ok, i have to sleep on the west side because i grew up in california and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side. 

MONICA:
 oh my god, you're a freak. 

 yeah. how 'bout that.    

 so uh, ryan, were you shipping off to? 

 i really can't say. 

ROSS:
 so do you have like any nuclear weapons on board? 

 i can't say. 

RACHEL:
 well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys. 

 i'm sorry, but i can't say. 

ROSS:
 wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines. 

 i better get out of here, i'm gonna miss my flight. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, i'll walk you out. 

ROSS:

 pleasure. 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh yeah. 

ROSS:
 i'll make some calls.  

RACHEL:
 ok.   

 can you believe how we spent our two weeks together? 

 i know. we didn't do any of the romantic things i had planned, like having a picnic at central park and ya know, coffee at central perk. oh i just got that.  

 taxi. 

PHOEBE:
 bye you.    closing credits   

RACHEL:
 oh i'm sorry, we're clo-... hey sailor. 

ROSS:
 is this what you had in mind? 

RACHEL:
 i'll say.   

ROSS:
 i'm shipping out tomorrow. 

RACHEL:
 well then uh, we better make this night count.  wait, i forgot to turn off the cappucino machine.  anchors away. oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse.   oh, you know what. i forgot to turn off the bathroom light. 

RACHEL:
 hey joey, how'd the audition go? 

JOEY:
 incredible! i met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. 

 who? 

JOEY:
 all right. i'll give you one hint. warren beatty. 

 wow! 

JOEY:
 yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. see, i, uh, had to kiss this guy. 

CHANDLER:
 'cause he was just so darn cute. 

JOEY:
 no, as part of the audition. see, i'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses. 

ROSS:
 well, hey. you're an actor, i say you just suck it up and do it.   or you just do it. 

JOEY:
 i did do it, i'm a professional. 

MONICA:
 then what's the problem? 

JOEY:
 see after the scene, mr. beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like mother theresa, not a good mother.  

PHOEBE:
 well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. what does warren beatty know about kissing   opening credits   

CHANDLER:
 hey, what did your agent say? 

JOEY:
 yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, mr. beatty wants to see it again on monday. man, i gotta figure out what i'm doing wrong. oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me. 

MONICA:
 what, forget it! 

RACHEL:
 yeah, right. 

JOEY:
 come on, i need your help here. 

PHOEBE:
 all right. i'll do it, i kissed him before i can do it again. 

JOEY:
 you see this, this is a friend. 

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh, let's go.   good, very good, firm but tender. i'd recommend you to a friend. 

JOEY:
 then i don't know what it is. what's the problem? 

MONICA:
 joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on. 

JOEY:
 yeah, that makes sense.  

ROSS:
 over my dead body!  

CHANDLER:
 and i'll be using his dead body as a shield.   

ROSS:
   tell her she looks good.   chest, and a big, huge skirt, kinda like the one's women wore in the 1800s, monica and  

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 i can not believe i have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.

ROSS:
 so don't, i don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding. 

RACHEL:
 because i promised mindy i would. 

MONICA:
 yeah, well you promised barry, you'd marry him.   

RACHEL:
 look you guys, i have to go, i'm the maid-of-honor. and besides you know what i just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.   

PHOEBE:
 ooh-oh! someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. someone get a little action? 

CHANDLER:
 i may have. 

MONICA:
 woo-hoo, stuud! 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 well she totally called me on it, okay. she said, 'cut it out, get real', and i did. 

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

 oh, yeah, i don't like you this way. all right, i'll see you guys later. 

 bye, richard. 

MONICA:
 bye sweetie,  

 i love you, too.   

PHOEBE:
 i think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, i wonder what our wedding's gonna be like. 

MONICA:
 what are you talking about? what wedding? 

PHOEBE:
 come on, like you never talk that. 

MONICA:
 nooo! never! i mean, we're living in the moment. god, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'where is this going?' 

RACHEL:
 afraid to ask him? 

MONICA:
 could not be more terrified. 

CHANDLER:
 well, i think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give rachel another chance to dress up like princess bubble yum.   

MONICA:
   where's benny, there he is. 

 awww! you know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out. 

MONICA:
 hey, you know i got a question for ya. just a little thing, no pressure.  

 okay. 

MONICA:
 did you ever, uh, like, think about the future? 

 sure i do. 

MONICA:
 yeah, am i in it? 

 honey, you are in it. 

MONICA:
 oh god, you are about to get sooo lucky. 

 oh, yeah! 

MONICA:
 keep talkin'. 

 well, uh, sometimes i think about selling my practice, we could move to france, make french toast. 

MONICA:
 okay, so, uh, we're in france, we're making the toast. do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 what if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. i mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip. 

CHANDLER:

 what?! 

 what,   thank you, thank you very much. anyway, i wish you both a wonderful life together. and rachel... 

RACHEL:

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding? 

ROSS:
 most of you don't know me, i'm rachel's boyfriend. 

RACHEL:
 oh dear god. 

ROSS:
 ross, uh and uh, i'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for rachel to come here tonight. and, uh, for the record she did not run out on barry because she had syphilis.  walked out on, on barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  

RACHEL:
  

ROSS:
  

 and once again she is out of here. okay who had 9:45? um? 

RACHEL:
  know what barr, i'm not gonna leave. i probably should, but i'm not, see 'cause i promised myself that i would make it through at least *one* of your weddings  now, tonight, all i  really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. well  left to say except.... yellow feathers  would..."

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 yeah. look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.

ROSS:

MONICA:
 do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?

PHOEBE:
 all right, there are no questions in the happy place. okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....

MONICA:
 i'll bet he's totally over me, i'll bet he's fine.

PHOEBE:
 all right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, i'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. okay. just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. and the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....

MONICA:
 okay, this isn't working. i'm still awake and now i have to pee. 

 so, i hear, you hate me!

JOEY:
 i, ah, i never said hate, i was very careful about that.

 a little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.

JOEY:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 i called him. 

 nooo. 

MONICA:
 yes. well i got his machine and i left a message. but it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. it was breezy! oh god, what if it wasn't breezy?  

PHOEBE:
 well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place. 

MONICA:
 here, i got it. i'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough. 

JOEY:
 monica, how are you gonna do that? 

MONICA:
 i know the code to his answering machine. 

ROSS:
 okay, mon, i really don't think this is the... okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.   

  the tone." 

 "you have two new messages." 

JOEY:
 wow, what a cool job.  'please, pass the pie.' 

MONICA:
  message from you and i didn't know if it was old or new or what. so, i'm just checkin'. so let me know, or don't, whatever. i'm breezy." 

JOEY:
 hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy. 

  about this weekend, okay. 

JOEY:
 now she sounded breezy.  commercial break   

MONICA:
 he's seeing someone. i can't believe he's seeing someone. 

PHOEBE:
 monica, you don't know that. 

MONICA:
 well, who's voice was that? 

CHANDLER:
 maybe it was his sister's. you know, maybe it was his daughter's. 

MONICA:
 michelle! of course, it was michelle! did it sound like michelle? 

ROSS:
 oh, great. it's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 all right, you will notice that i am fully dressed. i, in turn, have noticed that you are not. so in the words of a. a. milne, "get out of my chair, dillhole!" 

JOEY:
 okay.  

CHANDLER:
 what are you doing? 

JOEY:
 you said i had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions. 

CHANDLER:
 the cushions are the essence of the chair! 

JOEY:
 that's right! i'm taking the essence. 

CHANDLER:
 oh-ho, it'll be back. oh-ho, there's nobody in the room. 

ROSS:
 look, i'm sorry, i thought it looked pretty. 

RACHEL:
 ross, that was a halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as little bo peep. 

ROSS:
 look, i didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, which, by the way chandler, i would like back one of these days. 

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 because, i'm not wearing any underwear now. 

ROSS:
 okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight? 

JOEY:
 it's a rented tux. okay. i'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues. 

CHANDLER:
 well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions. 

JOEY:
 okay, you hide my clothes. i'm gonna do the exact opposite to you. 

CHANDLER:
 what are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes? 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. maybe i should wear pants? 

ROSS:
 yeah, pants, what, what an idea. or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. look, i don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. no, no i don't care if they match. i don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. okay. 

RACHEL:
 but i... 

ROSS:
 no, no, no just do it. go in there and pick something out so we can go. 

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
  that's allowed. yeah-huh! i mean look, yeah, you know what i would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your dad about. what do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? come on we're friends!!  

ROSS:
 no, no, no, no. tick, tick, tick, tick. 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 okay, we're on it. we're on it.  

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 i'm not gonna gooo. 

ROSS:
 you're not going to go. 

RACHEL:
 no, i think i'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. 

ROSS:
 how, how, um how can you not be going? 

RACHEL:
 i'm not gonna gooo, so i think that will accomplish the not going. 

ROSS:
 um, you know, just out of curiosity... 

RACHEL:
 well, ever since i was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, i'm just, i don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. 

ROSS:
 right. right, okay, okay. i'm sorry. i'm sorry i yelled. 

RACHEL:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

 well thanks. 

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 there it is.

RACHEL:
 oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. 

ROSS:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 do i look fat?

 noo.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow. 

RACHEL:
 okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.

CHANDLER:
 okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her....

ROSS:
 whoa, whoa, whoa. you looked at her. you never look. you just answer, it's just a reflex. do i look fat? nooo! is she prettier than i am? noo! does size matter?

RACHEL:
 nooo!

ROSS:
 and it works both ways.

CHANDLER:
 okay, so you both just know this stuff?

RACHEL:
 well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.

ROSS:
 okay, for instance. let's say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. which do you do?

CHANDLER:
 that's easy, baggage claim.

ROSS:
  three, you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her.

CHANDLER:
 okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know i'm all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. so, uh, how do i tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.

RACHEL:
 oh honey, i'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. 

ROSS:
 oh.

RACHEL:
 all right are you guys gonna come down?

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 okay, you're in bed. she's over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  over to her side of the bed. and then you rollll a-way. hug for her! roll for you.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

 okay, first i'm not crazy. and second, say it don't spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he wasn't following me, i mean he was, but 'cause he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'cause of the restraining order.

CHANDLER:
 umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom.

PHOEBE:
 ooh! no, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. he's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. and we just get along really well, and he's so cute.

ROSS:
 oh my god, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.

PHOEBE:
 no, i'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-ursula-ized', like you know, like i did for joey after he went out with her.

JOEY:
   

PHOEBE:
 okay, i asked for the news, not the weather.

MONICA:
 

 hey mon.

MONICA:
 joey, this is for you. 

JOEY:
 aww. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, joe, i gotta ask. the girl from the xerox place buck naked  , or, or a big tub of jam. 

JOEY:
 put your hands together.

MONICA:
 joey, take your time with that. that's my last batch.

JOEY:
 no more jam?!

RACHEL:
 well, what happened to your jam plan?

MONICA:
 i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. so, i've got a new plan now. babies.

CHANDLER:
 well, your gonna need much bigger jars.

ROSS:
 what are you talking about?

MONICA:
 i'm talking about me having a baby.

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 are you serious?

MONICA:
 yeah. the great thing about the jam plan was, i was taking control of my life. so i asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when i came up with the baby plan. 

ROSS:
 well, aren't you forgetin' something? what, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? dad!

MONICA:
 it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with, if i have to wait another 28 years then, i'll be 56 before i can have a baby, and that's just stupid.

CHANDLER:
 that, that's what's stupid.

MONICA:
 i don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. and there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.

RACHEL:
 down at the docks again? 

 night-night bing-a-ling.

CHANDLER:
 night-night.....janice.  all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. that would be weird though. okay, hug and roll time. i'm huggin', i'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! freedom!  time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. quick like a cat, quick like a cat! and 1...2...3!'  commercial break 

 here's my binoculars.

PHOEBE:
 oh, great. great. you're doing great, you know real strong. going strong. keep going.

 these are my night vision goggles. this is the book i pretend to read when i'm watching her in the park. and these are mad lips, they're just for fun.

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah. what's this? 

 oh, this is log i kept, recording her every movement. do you wanna here something from it?

PHOEBE:
 um, not even a little bit.

 it's about you.

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay then.

  such a loser. and, then when i was walking home i thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.

PHOEBE:
 good. so what were you thinking?

 i was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.

PHOEBE:
 really?

 no.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

 see that's just something i said now, so that maybe i could kiss you.

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay.   

CHANDLER:
 no, that's all right. i just had a jar of mustard.

MONICA:
  down! okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male geena davis.

CHANDLER:
 you mean there's more than one of us.

ROSS:
 look, you can't do this mon. all right, if you do this, i'm, i'm gonna, i'm, i'm gonna.....

MONICA:
 you're gonna what?

ROSS:
 i'm gonna tell mom.

RACHEL:
 honey, i'm sorry, but he's right. i love you, but you're crazy.

ROSS:
 crazy.

MONICA:
 what?! why? why is this crazy? so this isn't the ideal way to something....

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 lips moving, still talking. i mean it may not be ideal, but i'm so ready. no, i-i-i see the way ben looks at you. it makes me ache, you know?

JOEY:
 check it out!! jam crackers!

MONICA:
 okay, all right, how's this? 27. italian-american guy. he's an actor, born in queens. wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. 

 'new york knicks, rule!'

JOEY:
 yeah, the knicks rule!

MONICA:
 joey, this is you!

JOEY:
 let me see. 

RACHEL:
 when did you go to a sperm bank?

JOEY:
 well, right after i did that sex study down at nyu.  remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?

CHANDLER:
 and that's how you bought it?

JOEY:
 noooo, that's what i was wearing when i donated. i'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.

MONICA:
 well, honey, it is pretty competitive. i mean i've got an actual rocket scientist here.

JOEY:
 maybe, i should call this place and get them to put my 'days of our lives' on here. you know, juice this puppy up a little.

PHOEBE:
 

 hey.

ROSS:
 how's the maniac?

PHOEBE:
 oh, well he's yummy. we did a little kissin'.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 oh, no, no, no, no. you know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. he quit for me.

RACHEL:
 pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for god knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.

PHOEBE:
 look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.

ROSS:
 you're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?

PHOEBE:
 what, he's not still following her. do you think he is still following her?

CHANDLER:
 pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.

PHOEBE:
 what are you saying i should do?

MONICA:
 i think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.

PHOEBE:
 thank you, monica.

JOEY:
 orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.

MONICA:
 oh, that's what i would do, forget mine. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god, what happened? 

 oh. god, crazy chandler. he spun me...off...the...bed!

RACHEL:
 wow! spinning that sounds like fun.

 oh,  thing. 

RACHEL:
 

 you know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... oh... my....god.  she comes up to one with a wire mesh garbage can next to it. malcom stops and starts walking the other way and passes phoebe, who quick tries to hide behind the garbage can. 

 phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 yes? yes! oh.

 what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. oh, here it is! oh. 

 were you following me?

PHOEBE:
 um, perhaps. yes! yes, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.

 so you spied on me. i can't believe you don't trust me.  

PHOEBE:
 oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. just walkin' along looking like me. what, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?

 i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i tried to stop, but i couldn't. i'm so pathetic.

PHOEBE:
 no, no, it's not your fault. you know it's partly my fault, 'cause i made you quit cold turkey. sorry, no. okay, well, i mean, i can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  help you get over my sister. okay, stalk me for a while. huh? yeah, and, and, and, i'll be like an ursula patch.

 uh-huh, i don't know.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, just, okay, look i'm going. um, come on. op, op, behind the pillar, which way am i gonna go?  

JOEY:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey.

JOEY:
 where you going?

MONICA:
 to the bank.

JOEY:
 sperm or regular?

MONICA:
 sperm.

JOEY:
 so you're really doing this, huh?

MONICA:
 oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. 

JOEY:
 sounds nice.

MONICA:
 'fraid so. brown hair, green eyes...

JOEY:
 no kiddin', hmm. 

MONICA:
 what?

JOEY:
 no, i-i figured you would've picked a blond guy.

MONICA:
 really? why?

JOEY:
 i don't know, i just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... hoyt.

MONICA:
 hoyt?

JOEY:
 it's a name, yeah. i saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.

MONICA:
 really, is he a swimmer?

JOEY:
 he's got the body for it.

MONICA:
 i like that. 

JOEY:
 you guys have one of those signs that says: 'we don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.

MONICA:
 we do not have one of those signs.

JOEY:
 sure you do, it was a gift from me. oh! and you have these three great kids.

MONICA:
 two girls and a boy?

JOEY:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 and, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. and they're, they're running around on the deck. then hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.

JOEY:
 sure!  too. 

MONICA:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 oh monica.   wow, this guy's an astronaut. that would've been cool,  like a day.  closing credits 

JOEY:
 i called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of tribianni. nobody wants my product. i mean, i-i-i don't get it   maybe if they met me in person.

RACHEL:
 honey, you got a little thing on your...

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hello.

ROSS:
  talk to you for a second?

CHANDLER:
 sure. what's up?

 welcome everybody, welcome to amazing discoveries!

PHOEBE:
 oh, oh! it's on again!

JOEY:
 you guys, can we please not watch this all right.

 shhhh!

 folks, has this ever happened to you. you go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.

JOEY:
   aw! there's got to be a better way!

 and there is kevin.

JOEY:
 can we please turn this off?

RACHEL:
 noo way, kevin.

 there is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. meet the milk master 2000.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 you're flingin'-flangin' right i am!

 keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.   this works with any milk carton.

JOEY:
    opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 well, it's official there are no good movies.

 well, let's go to a bad one and make out.  

MONICA:
 perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,   so that you can bunny bump against my back.

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey, man. what's up?

JOEY:
 maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition i didn't know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?!

CHANDLER:
 well, i'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.

PHOEBE:
 yes, it was! it was him! uh huh!  me! 

JOEY:
 how is it you?

PHOEBE:
 well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. i mean, chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and i hadn't found a place to hide yet. i-i-i meant to tell you, and i wrote it all down on my hand. see, all of it.  

JOEY:
 yep, that's my audition.

MONICA:
 see, now this is why i keep notepads everywhere.

PHOEBE:
 yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.

 what is the great tragedy here? you go get yourself another appointment.

JOEY:
 well, estelle tried, you know. the casting director told her that i missed my chance.

PHOEBE:
 that is unfair. i'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.

JOEY:
 pheebs, you can't do that. the casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.

PHOEBE:
 what a sad little life she must lead. okay, ooh 

JOEY:
 what, what are you doing? what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 no, no, no, i know, i know, ooh.  'hi, this is katelynn, from phoebe buffay's office. um, is um, ann there for phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'

JOEY:
 hang up, hang up.  

PHOEBE:
  apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office? estelle, no, i don't know what i'm going to do with her. no. all right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'

CHANDLER:
 is anybody else scared?

PHOEBE:
  it for estelle. i don't care! annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'   i need a pen.  

CHANDLER:
 get the woman a pad! get the woman a pad! a pad! a pad!

MONICA:
 oh, now you want a pad. 

 

ROSS:
 there's my boy! here's my boy! and here's his barbi   what's ah, what's my boy doing with a barbi?

 he picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.

 he carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.

ROSS:
 yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. why, why, why does he have it, again?

 so he's got a doll? so what? unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.

 this doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?

ROSS:
 you know what it's fine. if you're okay with the barbi thing, so am i. 

ROSS:
 give daddy the barbi! ben, give, give me the barbi. okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?   no. okay, oh, oh, how about a dino-soilder? 

RACHEL:
 ross, you are so pathetic. why can't your son just play with his doll? 

MONICA:
  boob?

JOEY:
 i love that movie. 

MONICA:
 there it is. joey, what are you doing?

JOEY:
 i'm sorry, it just felt nice.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater.

CHANDLER:
 just do it! okay, it's janice and if i get it i'm going to have to see her tonight. 

RACHEL:
 what's the big deal? why don't you wanna see janice?

CHANDLER:
 okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.

ROSS:
 and that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?

CHANDLER:
 noo.

ROSS:
 you didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.

CHANDLER:
 no, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm

 'run for your life! get out of the building!'

RACHEL:
 men are unbelievable.

MONICA:
 what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?

CHANDLER:
 i know, that,   that's why i don't want to go tonight, i'm afraid i'm going to say something stupid.

MONICA:
 oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.

JOEY:
 hey, you know about that?!

CHANDLER:
 look what do i do? i wanna get past this, i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. i wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!  

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 do we have any... have any thoughts here?

JOEY:
 well, i've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as i understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. but, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! if you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. right. in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.

RACHEL:
 amazingly, that makes sense.

CHANDLER:
 you think?

JOEY:
 oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, joe, i assure you if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun, i'm pretty much peeing every which way. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's your audition from this morning. can i use the phone again?

RACHEL:
 sure pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.

JOEY:
 come on baby, come on!

PHOEBE:
  page. okay, well, um, she's in her car i'll have to patch you through.'

RACHEL:
 very nice touch.

PHOEBE:
  annie.  for scale?' you ask me. well, i don't know about that,   except that i do and he will. great, oh you are such a sweetheart. i would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... tunnel.

RACHEL:
 unbelievable.

JOEY:
 thank you so much.

PHOEBE:
 it was really fun, i mean i've never talked on a car phone before.

JOEY:
 you were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that i really, really want, and estelle couldn't get me in.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i don't know. i mean it was fun one time.

JOEY:
 come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.

PHOEBE:
 two?

JOEY:
 yeah! well, well really it's three. please. you're so good at it. i love you.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i'll do it, but just these three, right

JOEY:
 nooo, four. 

 so, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?

CHANDLER:
 'cause, i wanted to uh, give you this. 

 ohhh, are you a puppy!  what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.

CHANDLER:
 well, wait there's, there's more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. 

 oh, you didn't have to do this.

CHANDLER:
 yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. 

 well, i gotta buy a vowel. because, oh my gawd! who, would've thought that someday, chandler bing would buy me a drawer.

CHANDLER:
 well, not me. but that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. we should take a trip.

 we should?

CHANDLER:
 yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. and, i wanna meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents!

  now! are you okay?

CHANDLER:
 i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that i'm here it's like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let's move in together.' and i'd be okay.

 you probably want us to move in together?

CHANDLER:
 it doesn't scare me!

 yeah, well, it scares me! i mean i not even divorced yet, chandler. you know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. and, and i wasn't even that hungry. you know what, it's getting a little late, and i-i should just, um...

CHANDLER:
 oh, no, no, no, don't go! i've scared ya'! i've said too much! i'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!   hey, janice! it's me. um, yeah, i-i-i just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.  commercial break 

RACHEL:
 honey, this will help. 

CHANDLER:
 so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.

 uff.

MONICA:
 that is never good.

CHANDLER:
 then i got all needy and clingy.

RACHEL:
 okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. how did you leave it?

CHANDLER:
 she said she'd call me.

 ohh! 

CHANDLER:
 oh god.

MONICA:
 welcome to our side of the tunnel.

CHANDLER:
 this ice cream tastes like crap by the way.

RACHEL:
 yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. we sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.

MONICA:
 you know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.

RACHEL:
 yeah, you do.

CHANDLER:
 so, you don't think i'm terminal?

MONICA:
 well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay. so, should i call her?

 nooo!

RACHEL:
 this is a very critical time right now. if you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. you want her back you have to start acting aloof.

MONICA:
 she has to know that your not ready.

RACHEL:
 right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof.

CHANDLER:
 so i'm not, not gonna lose her?

RACHEL:
 oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.

CHANDLER:
 i said, 'so i'm not gonna lose her?'

RACHEL:
 oh.  

ROSS:
 guess who's here. it's the toughest guy in toy land, ben.  real american hero. i'm g.i. joe!' drop the barbi, drop the barbi.

RACHEL:
 g.i. joe? do you really think he's gonna fall for that?

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 look ben, it's a toy that protects u.s. oil interests overseas!

 go joe!!!

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 pheebs! there you are!

PHOEBE:
 no it's not, sorry.

JOEY:
 but phoebe, wait! wait! phoebe. phoebe! 

PHOEBE:
 oh, joey! oh, okay, see i didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.

JOEY:
 look listen, that tv movie i went in for? did you hear anything? i think i got a shot at it.

PHOEBE:
 yes! they called and you didn't get it! okay, i mean you didn't get it, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.

JOEY:
 it's okay, these things happen.

PHOEBE:
 but they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. oh god, i don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.

JOEY:
 i'm, i'm okay. see. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. you know what, i, i'm sorry i quit, okay, i just quit.

JOEY:
 no! no, no you can't quit! you're the best agent i ever had! look pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.

PHOEBE:
 not personal, really, well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent.

JOEY:
 they actually said that?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. ooh god, there's that face again! see i can't do this job! i...

JOEY:
 no, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. you know, estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way', but this, i can use this.   i canna work on a new accent.

PHOEBE:
 yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. yeah.

ROSS:
  then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against joey and chandler's   

  chandler!

CHANDLER:
 

 what are you doing here?

CHANDLER:
 

 are you being british?!

CHANDLER:
 

 why are you shopping here? you don't live in this neighborhood. were you here waiting for me?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, huh. i'm just uh, you know i'm just picking up some things for a party. 

 barley? what kind of party serves barley?

CHANDLER:
 well, i'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.

 where is this party?

CHANDLER:
 here in chelsea.

 who's party is it?

CHANDLER:
 a woman's

 what woman?!

CHANDLER:
 

 okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. so like which of these two guys do you want to be? 

CHANDLER:
 can i be that guy? 

PHOEBE:
 okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. 

JOEY:
 okay, shoot.

PHOEBE:
 okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.

JOEY:
 i didn't get it?

PHOEBE:
 no. they said you 'weren't believable as a human being.' so, you can work on that. 

JOEY:
 okay, what else?

PHOEBE:
 um, the off-broadway play people said 'you were pretty but dumb.'

JOEY:
 oh.

PHOEBE:
 oh no wait, i'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'

JOEY:
 look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, i really appreciate this pheebs, but i think i'm gonna have to go back to estelle.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

JOEY:
 yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her i don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, no, i understand.

JOEY:
 you do, thanks.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. sorry. 

JOEY:
 wait a minute.

PHOEBE:
 what?

JOEY:
 wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
   

CHANDLER:
 ....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.

MONICA:
 my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.

CHANDLER:
 i've actually ruined this haven't i? it's time for the good ice cream now, right?

RACHEL:
 yeah, it is.

MONICA:
 you know what, everything's gonna be okay.  

CHANDLER:
  okay. 

RACHEL:
 shhh...i don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.

MONICA:
 if-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 hello!

MONICA:
 oh wait, you know what, i got it, i got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. be sleepy.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

 oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and i cant believe that i screwed it up so bad.

PHOEBE:
 you really thought it was perfect?

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 maybe, my rulers wrong.

PHOEBE:
 maybe all the rulers are wrong.

JOEY:
 look its not that bad. so what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, y'know what i got a better idea. how-how bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?  

JOEY:
 yeah, listen, before i forget that side is still wet. 

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 

  

ROSS:

ROSS:
 yeah, maybe.

RACHEL:
 oh-oh, you lie.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.

ROSS:
 yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 okay, hold my crawler.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 well, yeah, kinda. um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  to sleep with you. no, no, no, its flattery.

 im sorry. 

ROSS:
 oh no, no, no, wait, wait, isabella. dont, dont just dismiss this so fast. i mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...

 yeah, for you. is that the list?

ROSS:
 im sorry the answer there would be...none of us.

 come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.

JOEY:
 well, thats really a different question.

 im sorry i find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.

JOEY:
 well, there was that one time that monica and rachel got together.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 i think on some levels she already knows.

ROSS:
 phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your grandmothers for a week now.

PHOEBE:
 okay, well maybe not on those levels.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 im never gonna find a roommate, ever.

PHOEBE:
 why, nobody good?

CHANDLER:
 well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural. the spitter. oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. nice to meet you, chandler bing bing! great apartment chandler bing, bing!

ROSS:
 so how many more do you have tomorrow?

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 yes, that is cool. because i have models here y'know......never.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 there never was a library. i mean there are libraries, its just that i ah, i never worked at one.

 you know whats really good here, the lobster. what do you say shall i just order three.

ROSS:
 yeah, if youre really hungry.  joke, i made a joke.

RACHEL:
 yeah, actually daddy ross is allergic to lobster.

 what kind of person is allergic to lobster? i guess the kind of person that works at a library.

ROSS:
 its not a library...

  only one around here who can make a joke! at least mine was funny. ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.  

ROSS:
 so, dr. green, hows the old boat.

 they found rust. you know what rust does to a boat?

ROSS:
 it gives it a nice antiquey look.

 

ROSS:
 wow. im sorry, when i was a kid i lost a bike to that.  

 excuse me for a moment, will you please, i want to say good night to the levines, before we go.

RACHEL:
 okay.

ROSS:
 okay! 

RACHEL:
 aw honey stop! its not that bad.

ROSS:
 yeah.  wrong. he only tipped like four percent.

RACHEL:
 yeah. thats daddy.

ROSS:
 thats daddy?! but doesnt it bother you? youre a waitress.

RACHEL:
 yes, it bothers me ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, id be serving him sneezers.

ROSS:
 so?

RACHEL:
 so. ross, ive bugged him about this a million times, hes not gonna change.

ROSS:
 you really serve people sneezers?

RACHEL:
 well um, i dont.

ROSS:
 thanks again, dr. green.

 all right.  

 oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, i think i forgot my receipt.

ROSS:

  twenty down here? huh?

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, that would be me, um, i have, i have a problem i-i tip way too much, way, way, too much, its a sickness really.

RACHEL:
 yeah it is, it is.  about that.

ROSS:
 i know.

 excuse me, you think im cheap?

RACHEL:
 oh daddy, no he didnt mean anything by that, he really didnt.

ROSS:
 nothing i do means anything, really.

 this is nice. i pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like mr. big shot. you really want to be mr. big shot? here, ill tell you what, you pay the whole bill, mr. big shot, all right.  

ROSS:
 well mr. big shot is better than wethead. 

JOEY:
 okay, some tricks of the trade. now, ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if im in a scene where i have to cry, i cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. or ah, or, lets say i wanna convey that ive just done something evil. that would be the basic i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it   okay, lets say ive just gotten bad news, well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.

 hey, mr. trib.

JOEY:
 hey-hey.

 guess what, i got an audition!

JOEY:
 awww, one of my students got an audition. im so proud.

 i was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?

JOEY:
 you bet! whats the part?

 oh its great, its a role on all my children, nick the boxer.  commercial break 

RACHEL:
 you had to do it, didnt you? you couldnt just leave it alone.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.   oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.

ROSS:
 yeah, im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. 

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 im, im freaking out! monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have! all right, i havent lived here in a while, so i have to ask you something. does monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?

RACHEL:
 um. yeah.

PHOEBE:
 i am soo dead. 

RACHEL:
 all right, look, heres the bottom line ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. so, ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.

ROSS:
 look, honey, i have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.

RACHEL:
 okay, look, ross, i realise that my father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.

ROSS:
 look sweetie, i could be the bigger man, i could be the biggest man, i could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that i could pick your father up and say like me! like me tiny doctor!

RACHEL:
 okay, well cant you just try it one more time ross? for me? for me?

ROSS:
 rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. you gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.

RACHEL:
 okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. because i already got a mother and a father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, i dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!

ROSS:
 what?  to tell chandler?

JOEY:
 well, i was thinking about that and i, i think the best way would be, to not.

RACHEL:
 joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.

JOEY:
 itll kill him. i mean itll, itll just kill him.

PHOEBE:
 well, you could wait til i go to the dentist, maybe ill kill him. 

JOEY:
  its like a play-doo fat factory. 

PHOEBE:
 well, im going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... all right, just look out! okay, and um, i also just wanna, i just wanna tell you all that um...... 

ROSS:
 okay, i have a problem i have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the homo sapien display.

JOEY:
 what did they do?

ROSS:
 well, they painted over the word sapien for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, lets just leave it at that.

MONICA:
 so, do you want me to watch ben for you?

ROSS:
 yes, thats what i was going to ask, thank you.

RACHEL:
 whoa! wait! hello! what about me?

ROSS:
 you? you! want to watch ben?   yes! thatd be great, no, i just wanted to ask monica, because i know how empty her life is.  

JOEY:
 hey-hey, ross?

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 ive got a science question.

ROSS:
 hmm?

JOEY:
 if the homo sapiens, were in fact homo-sapien, is that why there extinct?

ROSS:
 joey, homo sapiens are people.

JOEY:
 hey-hey, im not judging. 

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 okay. okay honey, hes fine, hes fine, lets just put him down. come here, ben.  how could you do that to him!! ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!

MONICA:
 hes not gonna say anything, because were not gonna tell him.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 okay, okay, okay.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 the second that ross walks in that door, i want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, 

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 a hat! yes! we need a hat.

RACHEL:
 we need a hat..

MONICA:
 where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

RACHEL:
 oh, oh, oh, ill get rainy day bear!! 

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh god, oh god, its sowed on though.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 janices birthday is coming up, i want to get her something speacial. come in here with me.

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.

CHANDLER:
 thats a good idea, dear janice have a hubba-bubba birthday. i would like to get her something serious.

JOEY:
 oh, you want something serious. y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. those are dead serious.

CHANDLER:
 all right. look, im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever. 

JOEY:
  cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 im not wrong! i wish i was. im sorry. bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?  

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 ah, i dont know, you tell me. anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
  commercial break 

MONICA:
 okay, ben, i wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.

RACHEL:
 monica, number one, i dont think ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, i... 

JOEY:
 you said number two.

RACHEL:
 i also said number one.

JOEY:
 i know. 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hi!

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 hes perfect, hes never been better.

ROSS:

ROSS:
 oh my god, he just said your name, thats great! good job ben.

 monica bang!

MONICA:
 oh thats right, thats what id sound like if i exploded.

PHOEBE:
 woo-hoo! the curse is broken! i called everybody i know, and everyone is alive.

JOEY:
 uh.

PHOEBE:
 what?

JOEY:
 ugly naked guy looks awfully still.  

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! i killed him! i killed another one! and this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.

RACHEL:
 well maybe hes just taking a nap.

JOEY:
 im tellin ya, he hasnt moved since this morning.

MONICA:
 all right, we should call somebody.

ROSS:
 and tell them what? the naked guy we stare at all the time isnt moving.

RACHEL:
 well, we have gotta find out if hes alive.

MONICA:
 how are we gonna do that? theres no way.

JOEY:
 well, there is one way. his windows open, i say, we poke him. 

JOEY:
 hey! y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get chinese food?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 well, now we got a reason.

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 well, were fashioning a very long poking device.

CHANDLER:
 all right.

JOEY:
 hey uh, whats a matter?

CHANDLER:
 i talked to janice.

JOEY:
 oh my god, is she going back to him?

CHANDLER:
 she doesnt know. says she loves us both. y'know i woke up this morning and i was in love, well i was happy. y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. and now i cant even return them, because she choked on the reciept!

JOEY:
 what are you ah, what are you gonna do?

CHANDLER:
 i dont know, y'know. what, what, would you do?

JOEY:
 well, it doesnt matter what i would do.

CHANDLER:
 come on, tell me.

JOEY:
 all right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  would bow out.

CHANDLER:
 what?   what are you, what are you talking about?

JOEY:
 they have a kid together, y'know. theyre like, theyre like a family, and if, i dont know, theres chance they could make that work, i know i wouldnt want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. are you okay? do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?  

ROSS:
 well, hes finally alseep. about that ah, bump on his head?

RACHEL:
 are you, are you, are you sure its ah, a new bump? i mean, no offense, ive always thought of ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.

ROSS:
 its okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, i figured you did the best you could.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i know! im saying you have to watch them all the time.

RACHEL:
 i did!! i watched! i watched! i watched monica bang his head against that thing!

ROSS:
 monica did it? 

ROSS:
 monica?

MONICA:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 umm, did you notice anything wierd about ben today?

MONICA:
 no. why?

ROSS:
 well, i was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly hes leaving out e and f. its like they just ah, i dont know, fell out of his head.

MONICA:
 really?!

ROSS:
 oh, and also, hes, hes walkin kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and hes in there just sort of y'know... 

MONICA:
 oh my god, i wrecked your baby!! 

RACHEL:
 i hope its still funny when youre in hell.

MONICA:
  

ROSS:
 monica bang! monica bang! 

RACHEL:
 ill get the hat. 

CHANDLER:
 janice, i have something i need to tell you, and i want you to let me get through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy.

 okay.

CHANDLER:
 i think you should go back with gary. i dont wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. whenever i would see him i was always think y'know youre the reason, you are the reason why their not together. and i hated that guy. and it didnt matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my dad.

 wow!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well. its the right thing to do.

 oh! youre right. oh god. but, before i can say good-bye, theres something i really need you to know, chandler. the way i feel about you, its like, i finally understand what lionel richies been singing about. y'know, i mean what we have, its like movie love, youre my soulmate, and i cant believe were not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.

CHANDLER:
 then dont leave me!

 what?

CHANDLER:
 forget what i said, i was babbling! pick me!

 no, you were right, you were right. i mean, i-i-ive got to give my marriage another chance.

CHANDLER:
 no you dont! no, no, no, i say you have to give your divorce another chance.

 

CHANDLER:
 ohhh. dont go.

 no, i-i-i gotta go.  

CHANDLER:
 no. no! no! no!

 honey, honey, people are looking.

CHANDLER:
 i dont care!  dont care!!

 yeah, um, im, im leaving now.  

CHANDLER:
 you cant leave! i have your shoe!

 good-bye chandler bing. 

 rachel has those in burgendy.  

JOEY:
 all right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately i have a lot of experience in that area.

ROSS:
 can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!

PHOEBE:
 im telling you hes dead. what we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.

JOEY:
 all right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke.   steady. steady. okay, a little higher. careful of the angle. okay, okay, were approaching the window   thread the needle. thread the needle.  

PHOEBE:
 hes alive! hes a-live!!!

MONICA:
 and yet, were still poking him.

JOEY:
 okay, retract the device, retract the device.

ROSS:
 he does not look happy.

RACHEL:
 hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device.

JOEY:
 hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! closing credits 

CHANDLER:
   i cant resist your charms. and love....

PHOEBE:
 

 ill be a fool for you. im sure, you know i dont mind.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 great, you can cover chandler.

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no, i dont, i dont really wanna play.

JOEY:
 come on man! you never want to do anything since you and janice broke up.

CHANDLER:
 thats not true! i wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. i wanted to start drinking in the morning. dont say that i dont have goals!

JOEY:
 chandler, you have to start getting over her. all right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe itll take your mind off janice, and if you dont play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even. come on.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, all right, ill play.

PHOEBE:
 yay!!

RACHEL:
 lets do it! ross?

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 um, monica and i arent supposed to play football.

JOEY:
 says who? your mom?

 yeah.

MONICA:
 well, every, every thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the geller bowl.

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no, you say that proudly.

MONICA:
 anyway, ross and i were always captains, and um, it got kindve competitive and one year, geller bowl vi, i accidentally broke rosss nose.

ROSS:
 it was soo not an accident. she saw i was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. and just keep running.

MONICA:
 to score the winning touchdown, by the way.

ROSS:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 oh yeah! then how come you didnt get the geller cup?

RACHEL:
 um, there was a geller cup?

ROSS:
 yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. but our dad said, nobody won that game,  and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  in the lake.

CHANDLER:
 and was the curse lifted?

ROSS:
 anyway. thats when our mom said we were not to play football ever again.

MONICA:
 y'know what, i think we should play a game. i mean come on, its been twelve years.

ROSS:

MONICA:
 

ROSS:

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.     for a touchdown, and starts to dance in celebration. chandler then tackles him, and he     and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. but all she ends up doing is running around   standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. something hits her on the head and   

PHOEBE:
 i love this game!! 

ROSS:
 hey, whered you get that?

RACHEL:
 i went really long.

MONICA:
 forty-two to twenty-one! like the turkey, ross is done!

ROSS:
 its no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.

MONICA:
 youre so pathetic! why cant you just accept it, were winning because im better than you. 

MONICA:
 oh, what a great argument, exhaling! all right, y'know what, ill prove it to you, okay. ill trade you joey for rachel, and ill still win the game.

ROSS:
 what?! the guys against the girls? see, thats ridiculous monica, because im only down by three touchdowns.

MONICA:
 oh, then bring it on! oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 i can not believe your trading me!!

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no, the games not over, were just switching teams.

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

JOEY:

MONICA:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 all right, no, well i want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?     run up field. rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she doesnt slow him down. monica and phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop    

MONICA:
 all right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and were down by two points. two points....   phoebe you do a button-hook again. rachel, you go long.

RACHEL:
 no! come on! dont make me go long. use me. they never cover me.

MONICA:
 honey, theres a reason.

RACHEL:
 god, im not lame, okay. i can do something. i can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 thank you! break!

MONICA:
 thirty-two! seventy-one! hike! 

 one-mississippi! two-mississippi! three-mississippi!  along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past monica, as she gets to 

RACHEL:
 im so sorry! are you okay?

MONICA:
 no! im not okay!

RACHEL:
 im sorry, they were just all coming at me, and i didnt know what to do.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!

MONICA:
 come on! come on! hurry! were running out of time! huddle up!

PHOEBE:
 okay. oooh! oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.

MONICA:
 all right, phoebe get open. rachel, go long.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 break!  over phoebe, leaving rachel wide open. ross starts to rush monica, who sees phoebe is double covered, in desperation she throws to rachel. we see flying through the air, and then rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then rachel again, then the ball, then phoebe, chandler, and joey staring at it in shock. then with the grace of jerry rice  , rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. both 

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey-hey-hey rachel, funny thing. actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so youre five feet short, so we win!

PHOEBE:
 wait-wait-wait-wait! so, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged rachel, then isnt the play still going. 

ROSS:
 let go! let go!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 no! you let go!

MONICA:

ROSS:
 how come its always us left in the field holding the ball?

MONICA:
 i dont know. i guess the other people just dont care enough. 

ROSS:
 hey! its starting to snow.  

ROSS:
 gimme the this!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?

 rachel?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

 do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?

RACHEL:
 oh, sure! do you need me to train somebody new?

  again, whenever.

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
  opening credits  

 so thats two boxes of the holiday macaroons. on behalf of the brown birds of america, i salute you.  then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird 

ROSS:
 just admit it chandler, you have no backhand.

CHANDLER:
 excuse me little one, i have a very solid backhand.

ROSS:
 shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.

CHANDLER:
 i was shrieking... like a marine. 

ROSS:
 all right here. watch me execute the three ps of championship play. power.  backswing and hits sarah whos started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both  

MONICA:
 you broke a little girls leg?!!

ROSS:
 i know. i feel horrible. okay.

CHANDLER:
  street last night. 

ROSS:
 well, im gonna go see her. i want to bring her something, what do you think shell like?

MONICA:
 maybe a hello kitty doll, the ability to walk... 

RACHEL:
 im gonna get back to retraining. 

ROSS:
 all right, see you guys. 

CHANDLER:
 look out kids, hes coming!  

JOEY:
 and i gotta go sell some christmas trees.

PHOEBE:
 have fun. oh wait, no, dont! i forgot i am totally against that now.

JOEY:
 what? me having a job?

PHOEBE:
 no, no, i am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  how do you sleep at night?

JOEY:
 well, im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. hey, phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. those trees were born to be christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.

PHOEBE:
 really?  

CHANDLER:
 yes. yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, its the only chance to see new york. 

 ...and after youve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....

RACHEL:
 gunther, gunther, please, ive worked here for two and a half years, i know the empty trays go over there. 

 what if you put them here.  

RACHEL:
 huh. well, y'know thats actually a really good idea, because that way theyll be closer to the mugs. y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.

 they already do. thats why they call it the tray spot.

RACHEL:
 gee, i always heard them talk about that, i just always thought that it was a club they went to. oh god, im, im sorry. 

 its all right. sweetheart. 

ROSS:
 so, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? i mean, your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore. 

 well, i kinda wanted to sell the cookies. the girl who sells the most wins a trip to spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

ROSS:
 wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?

 yeah. my dad says if i spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as i do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the taj mahal.

ROSS:
 i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india.

 no. the one in atlantic city, dad loves the slots. he says hes gonna double the college money my grandma left me.

ROSS:
 huh. well, good luck to dad. say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?

 the girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.

ROSS:
 yeah.

 so far, ive sold seventy-five.

ROSS:
 four hundred, huh? well, that sounds do-able.   how much are the boxes?

 five dollars a box.

ROSS:
 

 a ten speed bike. but, id rather have something my dad couldnt sell.

ROSS:
 well, that makes sense.

 could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble?

ROSS:
 yeah, sarah, anything.

 could you pull open the curtains for me? the astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we dont have a tv, the lady across the alley said shed push hers up to a window, so i could watch it.  

  yesss?

ROSS:
 hi, im selling brown bird cookies.

 youre no brown bird, i can see you through my peephole.

ROSS:
 no, hi, im, im an honorary brown bird  

 what does that mean?

ROSS:
 ah, well, it means that i can sell cookies, but im not invited to sleep-overs.

 i can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. now, go away!

ROSS:
 no, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to go to spacecamp more than anything in the world.

 im pressing, a policeman is on his way.

ROSS:
 okay, okay! im going. im going.  

 i can still see you!

ROSS:
 all right!! 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 hey. what, what are you doing here?

PHOEBE:
 well, i-i thought a lot about what you said, and um, i realilized duh, all right maybe i was a little judgmental. yeah, 

JOEY:
 look now, phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their christmas....

PHOEBE:
 destiny.

JOEY:
 sure.

PHOEBE:
 yes.

JOEY:
 all right.

PHOEBE:
 okay.  that one doesnt look very fulfilled.

JOEY:
 oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.

PHOEBE:
 you keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.

JOEY:
 well we have to make room for the fresh ones.

PHOEBE:
 so, what happens to the old guys?

JOEY:
 well, they go into the chipper.

PHOEBE:
 why, do i have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play  no! nooooo!!!  

JOEY:
    

ROSS:
 ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite christmas characters, santa, rudolph, and baby jesus.

JOEY:
 all right, ill take a box of the cream filled jesuss.

ROSS:
 wait a minute, one box! come on, im trying to send a little girl to spacecamp, im putting you down for five boxes. chandler, what about you?

CHANDLER:
 ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?

ROSS:
 no, but ah, theres coconut in the hanukkah menoreoes. i tell you what, ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night. 

ROSS:
 mon?

MONICA:
 all right, ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and thats it. i-i started gaining weight after i joined the brown birds.  remember, how dad bought all my boxes and i ate them all?

ROSS:
 ah, no mon, dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. but ah, y'know im sure thats not gonna happen this time, why dont i put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the rudolphs.

MONICA:
 no.

ROSS:
 oh, come on, now you know you want em.

MONICA:
 dont, dont, dont, dont, dont do this.

ROSS:
 ill tell you what mon, ill give you the first box for free.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 come on! all the cool kids are eating em!  

 and when you have a second later, i wanna show you why we dont just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.

RACHEL:
  that i hate, my life officially sucks.

JOEY:
 look rach, wasnt this supposed to a temporary thing? i thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?

RACHEL:
 well, yeah! im still pursuing that.

CHANDLER:
 how... exactly are you pursuing that? y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?

RACHEL:
 well, im also sending out.... good thoughts.

JOEY:
 if you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothing pushing you to get another one. you need the fear.

RACHEL:
 the fear?

CHANDLER:
 hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.

RACHEL:
 well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, i mean why dont you quit and get the fear? 

CHANDLER:
 because, im too afraid.

RACHEL:
 i dont know, i mean i would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... oh, i just dont want to be 30 and still work here.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.

 rachel?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

 remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.

RACHEL:
 cant i just look at the handles on them?

 you would think.

RACHEL:
 okay, fine. gunther, y'know what, i am a terrible waitress, do you know why im a terrible waitress? because, i dont care. i dont care. i dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, i dont care where the tray spot is, i just dont care, this is not what i want to do. so i dont think i should do it anymore. im gonna give you my weeks notice.

 what?!

RACHEL:
 gunther, i quit.

CHANDLER:
  coffee?  commercial break  

ROSS:
 ....and 12, 22, 18, four... 

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 so, how many have you sold so far?

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 okay, the other night i was leaving the museum just as laser floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying i sold 50 boxes! thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. so i ah, started hitting the nyu dorms around midnight. i am selling cookies by the case. they

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 no, its not gonna be okay ross, tomorrow is my last day, and i dont have a lead. okay, y'know what, im just gonna, im just gonna call gunther and im gonna tell him, im not quitting.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
  yentel soup, a james beans, and a howdy hold the dowdy!

RACHEL:
 oh honey, come on, im sorry, i didnt.... i dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am i gonna learn about fashion by walking mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 thats excellent. 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 well, i assume ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job. 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because i drank it.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 i cant remember which sister.

ROSS:
   commercial break 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 veronica. look, its got to be veronica, the girl in the red skirt. i definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.

MONICA:
 that was me.

CHANDLER:
 look, when ive been drinking, sometimes i tend to get overly friendly, and im sorry.

MONICA:
 thats okay.

RACHEL:
 thats all right.

ROSS:
 thats okay.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:

JOEY:
 mary-angela.

ROSS:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 y'know which one was she again?

JOEY:
 why dont you ask chandler, cause hes the one that fooled around with her. she told me you said you could really fall for her. now is that true? or are you just gettin over janice by groping my sister. 

CHANDLER:
 its gotta be the first one.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 dear mary-angela. hi. hows it going. this is the hardest letter ive ever had to write.  you think joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?

CHANDLER:
 well, thats the part where you tell him that i moved to france. when actually ill be in cuba.

ROSS:
 all right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person. at least you know her name. you just go to the house and you ask for mary-angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.

CHANDLER:
 what if mary-angela comes to the door and i ask for mary-angela?

ROSS:
 where in cuba?  

CHANDLER:
  here?

JOEY:
 waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry. what about you?

CHANDLER:
 im here to see mary-angela.

JOEY:
 you are so the man!  listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my grandma doesnt know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. she was like the sixth person to spit on mussolini's hanging body. yeah.

CHANDLER:
 wheres mary-angela?

JOEY:
 shes right in there.   

 hey, chandler! 

RACHEL:
 i cant believe mark didnt call. its sunday night, and he didnt call.

ROSS:
 bummer.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 no, im genuinely sorry the mark thing didnt work out. look, rach, i want only good things for you.

MONICA:
 wait a minute, why dont you just call mark.   i mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, youve got to make stuff happen.

ROSS:
 but, you, you dont want to seem too pushy.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
  in like, to, to his home?

RACHEL:

MONICA:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 why dont you call him?! well, thank you very much! y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!

MONICA:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 what?! ross y'know this isnt even about you! i mean this is about rachel and something wonderful happening for her. i mean you know even if youre right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?

ROSS:

MONICA:
 i mean dont you trust her?

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 whats goin on?

CHANDLER:
 

 its no big deal. chandler was just kissin me because he thought i was mary-angela.

JOEY:
 what?! how could you do that, how could you think she was mary-angela?

CHANDLER:
 i wasnt sure which one mary-angela was.   look, im sorry okay, i was really drunk, and you all look really similar.

 i say, punch him joey.

 yeah! punch him!!

CHANDLER:
 y'know what, we should all calm down because your brothers not going to punch me. 

JOEY:
 well, that is usually what i would do. but i just never thought youd be on the receiving end of it. how could you do this?!

CHANDLER:
 joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, i deserve it. but i just want you to know that i would never soberly hurt you or your family, youre my best friend. i would never do anything like this ever again.

 so what. i say, punch him.

 yeah! punch him! punch him!

JOEY:
 no! no! no! no, im not going to punch chandler.

 ill do it.

JOEY:
 no you wont. look he knows he did a terrible thing and i believe him, hes sorry. but,  right, youve got to apologize to mary-angela.

CHANDLER:
 okay, absolutely!

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 oh, im sorry. but i really like this guy. and i think he really happens to like me. 

ROSS:
 maybe hes just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it? 

ROSS:
 maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?

JOEY:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 y'know if its any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.  

RACHEL:
  everybody hate these shoes? 

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, but don't worry. i don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress. 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
  start with her! 

CHANDLER:
 all right, i suppose i can wait a day. hey, what are you doing friday? 

ROSS:
 why? 

CHANDLER:
 i need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin albert, y'know he's the botanist. 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing.   is this actually a lunchbox? 

PHOEBE:
 umm, no, it's a purse. and there's a thermos in it. 

RACHEL:
 oh. 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 what? oh yeah, yeah i think so. why am i invited to this again? 

CHANDLER:
 well apparently albert has no friends. he's very excited about the bachelor party though. i think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper. 

PHOEBE:
 a stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. why don't you get a magician?! 

CHANDLER:
 well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.  opening credits

 and before you know it, she's with him. and you'll be all, 'ohh, man!' and he'll be all, 'yes!' and us, we'll be like, 'wh-whoa, dude.' and pretty soon you'll be like,  we'll be like, 'man get over it, it's been four years!!' 

CHANDLER:
 he paints quite a picture doesn't he?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 yeah, just like the one in the poem. 

PHOEBE:
 well not exactly like the one in the poem. 

MONICA:
 what do you mean? 

PHOEBE:
 remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? oh.   

MONICA:
 

 what? 

MONICA:
 y'know, so i don't read as many important books as you do, and i don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. and y'know what, i get excited about stupid stuff, like when i my people magazine comes on saturday, and the new hold everything catalog. y'know but that does not mean that i'm empty, i care about things. i care about my friends and family. you have no right to make that kind of judgment about me. 

 whoa, whoa, whoa. 

MONICA:
 you don't even know me... 

 whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. 

MONICA:
 what? 

 the empty vase is not about you. my baby, you make me so sad that you would think this. 

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, my friend phoebe... 

 no, it's about all women. well, all american women. you feel better now? 

MONICA:
  

 all right, let's do it!    

 no, no, no. what was that? 

JOEY:
 i know, it was the best i could get out of them. 

 well, people! 

JOEY:
 people, people, people.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 y'know what, i'm, i'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 a big idiot. 

ROSS:
 a big idiot. just you have to realize is, this whole mark thing is kinda hard for me.  

RACHEL:
 honey, why is it hard, i mean we've been together for almost a year now? 

ROSS:
 well, i was with carol for like eight years and i lost her. and now if it's possible i think i love you even more. so, it's hard for me to believe that i'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. 

 let it be me! let it be me! 

RACHEL:
 honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.   

ROSS:
 i gotta get going. bye chandler. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, okay ross. listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn? 

RACHEL:
 where ya going? 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 ahh, no. 

RACHEL:
 oh. 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 you are totally jealous. 

RACHEL:
 i'm not jealous. all right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. and y'know, and um, i... 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ugh. wait, wait, wait. 

ROSS:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 im going to let him.

ROSS:
 okay.

JOEY:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 oh, um, around 8:02. we ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.

PHOEBE:
 oh, theres no such thing as an innocent burger.

ROSS:
 so, are you gonna see him again?

MONICA:
 tomorrow night.

RACHEL:
 monica, what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now shes celebrating that by going on a date with him.

MONICA:
 its not a date, okay. im just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.

JOEY:
 well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know youll probably be hungry after the sex.

MONICA:
 were not gonna have sex! okay, nothings changed here. he still doesnt want children and i still do, so thats why were just gonna be friends.

ROSS:
 naked friends. 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 do you have any ice?

JOEY:
 check the freezer. if theres none in there, then were probably out. are you just getting in from work? its late.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i know. i had the greatest day though, i got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from calvin klien. i told my boss i liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. how was your day?

JOEY:
 i discovered im able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.

RACHEL:
 hmm.  shining in your freezer?

JOEY:
 oh, i was reading it last night, and i got scared, so.

RACHEL:
 but ah, youre safe from it if its in the freezer?

JOEY:
 well, safer. y'know, i mean i never start reading the shining, without making sure weve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.

RACHEL:
 how often do you read it?

JOEY:
 havent you ever read the same book over and over again?

RACHEL:
 well, umm, i guess i read little women more than once. but i mean thats a classic, whats so great about the shining?

JOEY:
 the question should be rach, what is not so great about the

 nothing. all right? this is like the scariest book ever. i bet its way better than that classic of yours.

RACHEL:
 okay. ah, well well just see about that, okay. i will read the shining,   and you will read little women. 

JOEY:
 all right, you got it.

RACHEL:
 all right.

JOEY:
 okay.

RACHEL:
 okay.

JOEY:
 ah, now rach, these ah, these little women.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 well, i suppose we just try to not look directly at it.

CHANDLER:
 like an eclipse.  

 so when people complement me on my cooking should i, what do i say?

MONICA:
 you say thank you very much, and then you buy me something pretty. come on, were gonna put are hands in this bowl, and were gonna start squishing the tomatoes. 

 ew, this feels very weird.

MONICA:
 you touch peoples eyeballs every day and this feels weird.

 yeah, well, sure i touch them, but i spent years learning not to squish them. 

MONICA:
 oops.

 okay.

MONICA:
 gotta keep squishing.

 tomatoes are squishing.

MONICA:
 okay.

JOEY:

ROSS:
 umm, jos a girl, its short for josephine.

JOEY:
 but jos got a crush on laurie.  its like a girl-girl thing? cause that is the one thing missing from the shining.

CHANDLER:
 no, actually lauries a boy.

JOEY:
 no wonder rachel had to read this so many times. 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey! howd the ah, basketball go?

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:

 just your dad.  know i-i do have a blind date with my sisters neighbour next tuesday.

MONICA:
 oh.

 you want me to cancel it?

MONICA:
 no! 

 okay.

MONICA:
 cause if you do that means youd be cancelling it for me, and were just friends.

 exactly.  

 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey. ooh! dont sit down! 

 you ready to go to the batting cage?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. and, first heres a gift.

 oh! wow! hey!

CHANDLER:
 stretchy pants! why, those are the greatest things in the world! if i were you i would wear them every day, every day!

 jeez, thank you really that is so nice. but um, to be honest, i dont think i can wear these, theyre so tight, i feel like im on display. im sorry.

PHOEBE:
 thats all right, thats well, i figured....  

 

JOEY:
 hey! 

ROSS:
 good.

JOEY:
 hey, rach, how you doing with the shining?

RACHEL:
 oh, danny just went into room 217.

JOEY:
 oooh, the next parts the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...

RACHEL:
 oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on youre gonna ruin it!

JOEY:
 all right ill talk in code.  kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?

CHANDLER:
 hmmm, thats very cool.

JOEY:
 oh, all blank, and no blank, makes blank a blank blank. oh no-no-no, no, the end when jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. aww!

RACHEL:
 joey! i cant believe you just did that!

CHANDLER:
 i cant believe she cracked your code!

RACHEL:
 all right, okay, laurie proposes to jo, and she says no, even though shes still in love with him, and then he ends up marring amy.

JOEY:
 hey! mine was by accident! all right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.

RACHEL:
 eh. beth dies. 

JOEY:
 beth, beth dies?

RACHEL:
 um-hmm.

JOEY:
 is that true? if i keep reading is beth gonna die?

CHANDLER:
 no, beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. does she rachel?

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
 joeys asking if youve just ruined the first book hes ever loved that didnt star jack nicholson?

RACHEL:
 no. she doesnt die.

JOEY:
 then why would you say that?!

RACHEL:
 because, i wanted to hurt you.

   

RACHEL:
 

 got em. 

MONICA:
 hi.

RACHEL:
  sorry.

MONICA:
 you would not believe my day! i had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, i lost one of my fake boobs,   in a grill fire. 

MONICA:
 what are you smiling at?

RACHEL:
 im sorry, i was just thinking youre day could still pick up.

MONICA:
 yeah, right.  

 hello.

MONICA:
 i love this friend thing! 

PHOEBE:
 listen, roberts gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?

ROSS:
 oh.

PHOEBE:
 please, right now, no, every time i see him its like is it on the lose? is it watching me?

CHANDLER:
 we cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.

ROSS:
 hes right, even if its to say something complementary.  

 

PHOEBE:
 hey.

  climbing wall, we can spot each other.

PHOEBE:
 no, i can spot you from here.

 what?

PHOEBE:
 okay, listen robert...

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, we got, um-hmm.

PHOEBE:
 umm, i think youre really, really great...

 oh god! here we go again. why does this keep happening to me?   is it something im putting out there? is this my fault? or am i just nuts?

PHOEBE:
 i-i-i-i-i dont know, i dont know what to say.

  put the mouse back in the house.   hear richard come in to the apartment, and monica frantically throws the rest of the pedals on the bed, and jumps onto the bed and puts a rose in her mouth, and bites a 

MONICA:
 ow!

  elses apartment. its got rooms, walls, and ceilings.

 well, i just wanted to see where you lived. now, give me the tour.

MONICA:
 oh my god! oh my god!  

 ah well, this is the living room.

 impressive.

 all right. this is the kitchen.

 oh, thats real pretty. wait a minute, dont i get to see the bedroom?

 the bedroom. well its pretty much your typical...  as monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the  bedroom.

 were still on this side of the door.

 um-hmm.

 yeah, but i didnt get to see it.

 oh shoot! maybe next time.    

MONICA:
 

 oh,  and switched it to today.

MONICA:
  asking as a friend, because i am totally fine with this.

 well, you seem fine.

MONICA:
  can i be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom....  y'know what, what if were friends who dont see other people?

 you mean like exclusive friends?

MONICA:
 why not?! i mean this has been the most amazing week. would it be so terrible? even if we were friends who lived together. or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.

 wow. y'know were back where we were. honey, i would love to do all that, but nothings changed.

MONICA:
 thats not true, you dont have a moustache.

 okay, okay, one things changed. but we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.

MONICA:
 y'know what, ive got to walk out of here right now, cause getting over you is the hardest thing that i have ever had to do. i dont think i could do it again.

 i know i couldnt. so.... 

MONICA:
 how bout one last game of racquetball?  

MONICA:
 watch the thorns!

  closing credits 

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.

 okay, my next songs called: phoebe buffay, what can i say. i really loved when we were singing partners, and i shouldnt have left you that way. 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 

 ah, yeah, umm. 

 

 yeah, but, i dont do that anymore. i got kinda sick of it, and then i couldnt come up with anything good, so they fired me.

PHOEBE:
 hmm, bummer.

 well, i y'know, i was just, umm, i was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.

PHOEBE:
 you never run on a barge!

JOEY:
 

 hey.

JOEY:
 is ah, is chandler around?

MONICA:
 no, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.

JOEY:
 oooh.

MONICA:
 yeah, ginger something.

JOEY:
 nooo. no, no, ah, are you sure it wasnt something that sounded like ginger, like ah, gingeer?

MONICA:
 no, it was ginger. i remember, because when he told me, i said, 

JOEY:
 aww, man. thats the girl i was hiding from. when she finds out hes my roommate, shes gonna tell him what i did.

MONICA:
 well, what did you do?

JOEY:
 what, oh, oh, oh, no, no, i cant, i cant tell you that, its like the most awful, horrible thing ive ever done my whole life.

MONICA:
 y'know what, dont tell us. well just wait until chandler gets home, 

JOEY:
 all right!! okay, it was like four years ago. okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her dads cabin. just me, her, and her annoying little dog pepper. well that night, i cooked this really romantic dinner....

MONICA:
 you gave her food poisoning!?

JOEY:
 i wish. no. after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out. so, i picked up a log and threw it on. or, at least what i thought was a log.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!! you threw pepper on the fire!

JOEY:
 i wish. see, i guess another thing i probably shouldve told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg. 

MONICA:
 oh my god! joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?

JOEY:
 i ran!! 

CHANDLER:
 well, thats the best kiss ive had with anyone ive ever met in a mens room.

 actually, me too.

CHANDLER:
  a puddle.

 oh damn, i hate that.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, were gonna have to get you out of those shoes.

 oh, dont worry about it.

CHANDLER:
 no, really youre gonna freeze.

 no, im not.

CHANDLER:
 youre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?

 some day, maybe. 

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 hmmm. oh, no, no, i just thinking about something funny i heard today. umm, mark, mark saying ill see you saturday.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 oh, well...

RACHEL:
 oh my god!!! ross!!

ROSS:
 well, im sorry, but ah, look if youre not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?

RACHEL:
 because, hes my friend.

ROSS:
 okay, but do you really need another friend? i mean...

RACHEL:
 okay, well if i stop playing with joey and chandler, can i play with mark?

ROSS:
 is that funny? am i supposed to be laughing?

RACHEL:
 i dont know, you thought see you saturday was funny. look honey, mark is in fashion okay, i like having a friend that i can share this stuff with. you guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.

ROSS:
 pa-haa!! i would love to go with you.

RACHEL:
 really!?

ROSS:
 yeah, hey i-i have clothes, i even pick them out. i mean for, for all you know i could be a fashion..... monger.

RACHEL:
 okay. honey, i would love for you to go with me.   what?

ROSS:
 what should i wear, now im all nervous.  

MONICA:
 y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.

PHOEBE:
 its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. not that i even care, y'know.

MONICA:
 phoebe why dont you just call her? you obviously want to.

PHOEBE:
 you think you know me so well.

MONICA:
 well, dont cha wanna?

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 okay, well i do know you.

PHOEBE:
 thats what i said.

MONICA:
 well so?

PHOEBE:
 i cant. i cant. she dumped me, i mean i totally trusted her and then one day it was okay, bye pheebs gone. y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun ive ever had in like all my lives. 

  the heel, holes in the toes. dont care what people say. my feets best friends, pals to the end. with them im one hot chicky. though late one night, not much light, i.... 

PHOEBE:
 

  sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time ill.... avoid the..... pillleeeee. commercial break 

 were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. for instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....

ROSS:
  youre so pretty. i love you.

RACHEL:
 oh.  

PHOEBE:
  smelly cat, its not your fault.

 wow, thats great.

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah!

 y'know you could totally sell this. itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.

PHOEBE:
 i..., a jingle? no, no-no-no, no.

 what? why not? you could make a ton of money.

PHOEBE:
 okay, well if i was in this for the money, id be a millionaire by now, y'know. you just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.

 aw, youre right, youre right. im sorry.

PHOEBE:
 thats okay. all right, im gonna play song thats really, really sad. its called magician box mix up.   

 ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.   

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

MONICA:
 oh, can i borrow this? 

CHANDLER:
 oh, i hate that. i once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.

MONICA:
 so umm, how was your date with ginger?

CHANDLER:
 great. it was great. shes ah, shes great, great looking, great personality, shes greatness.

MONICA:
 sounds like shes got the ah, whole package.

CHANDLER:
 joey told you about the leg, huh?

MONICA:
 uh-huh.

CHANDLER:
 oh god, it freaked me out. okay, i know it shouldnt have, but it did. i mean i like her, i dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its like hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? i mean im the smallest person in the world arent i? im the smallest person in the world.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 it came up.

JOEY:
 listen, i ah, i know its a longshot. but, by any chance did she find that funny?  

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 nodded off!! ross you were snoring. my fathers boat didnt make that much noise when it hit rocks!

ROSS:
 come on! forty-five minutes! forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.

RACHEL:
 well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to professor pitstains and hes hey everybody! remember that thing thats been dead for a gazillion years. well theres this little bone we didnt know it had!

ROSS:
 first of all its professor pittain! and second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didnt fly.

RACHEL:
 okay, see now, what i just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.

ROSS:
 y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what i do, i wonder how many people would go see a movie called, jurassic parka.

RACHEL:
 oh, that is so...

ROSS:
 no-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.  unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake 

RACHEL:
 y'know if what i do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? huh? was it so i just wouldnt go with mark?

ROSS:
 no. i... i wanted to be with you. i dont know, i feel like lately, i feel like youre slipping away from me, y'know. with this new job, and all these new people, and youve got this whole other life going on. i-i-i know its dumb, but i hate that im not a part of it.

RACHEL:
 its not dumb. but, maybe its okay that youre not a part of it. y'know what i mean?  that youre not involved in that part of my life.

ROSS:
 thats a little clearer.

RACHEL:
 honey see, it doesnt mean that i dont love you. because i do. i love you, i love you so much. but my work its-its for me y'know, im out there, on my own, and im doing it and its scary but i love it, because its mine. i, but, i mean is that okay?

ROSS:
 sure, i-i-i...  

 your thinking about my leg arent you?

CHANDLER:
 no. no. actually i forgot, what is the deal with that again?

 its okay if it bothers you. really. i mean the only thing i need

 how much it bothers you? because i dont like wasting my time. am i wasting my time?

CHANDLER:
 no. no. i dont think so.

 okay. its just like anything else, you just have to get used to it. 

 whats that?

CHANDLER:
 thats-thats my nubbin.

 whats a nubbin?

CHANDLER:
 its kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.

 you have three nipples?

CHANDLER:
 well, y'know two regulars. and ah one that barely qualifies as... 

 nothing. i, i just remembered i have to leave.

CHANDLER:
 you ah, you have, you have to leave, now? how come?

 ah well, its nubbin. nothing! umm. y'know what, ill see you later. okay.   

PHOEBE:
 

 come here, come here.  dont get mad, okay.

PHOEBE:
 okay, dont give me a reason to get mad, okay

 i played smelly cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.

PHOEBE:
 no, look, i told you that i didnt want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. god, y'know what, i think five years ago i probably wouldve done anything to play with you but, i can do it by myself. and if i cant trust you then just forget it. 

 no, no, i dont want to forget it.

PHOEBE:
 okay y'know what you have to choose. all right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have smelly cat, but we wont be partners. so whats it gonna be? 

  litter box? dont change your kitty, change your kitty litter. 

MONICA:
 sorry, pheebs.

JOEY:
 yeah. you okay?

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 yeah, for sure. okay. probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
   

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 hey.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 oh, theres banana on it.

PHOEBE:
 wow, i have the spirit of an old indian women living in mine.

MONICA:
 so then you know? 

PHOEBE:
 the mailman was downstairs, so i brought up your mail.

MONICA:
 oh, good. thanks.

PHOEBE:
 now what is fabutec?

MONICA:
 okay, all right dont judge me to much. okay? um, but i saw this info-mercial, and um, i swear to you i have never-ever bought anything on tv before, except for this mop. but there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....

PHOEBE:
 waxine!!

MONICA:
 yes! have you seen it?

PHOEBE:
 oh, its incredible! i so want to be a waxine girl.

MONICA:
 i know!!

PHOEBE:
 god. do think it really doesnt hurt? cause how can they do that?

MONICA:
 hello! organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!

PHOEBE:
 they have the best stuff in there. 

CHANDLER:
 oh my god! oh my god!

JOEY:
 yeah. we figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to make up with rachel. which is probably what you shoulda done. huh?

ROSS:
 you think?! god, i, ah, im in hell. i mean what, what am i gonna do? rachels all like, i love you and, and lets work on this. and all i can think about is, what is she gonna do? what is she gonna say? when i tell her what i did.

CHANDLER:
 well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. how dumb are you?

ROSS:
 what?! look, were trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. how am i supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?

JOEY:
 look, ross look, im on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.

CHANDLER:
 hes right. nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her.

JOEY:
 yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.

ROSS:
 yeah, but dont you think....

CHANDLER:
 all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. and thats what deathbeds are for.

ROSS:
 yeah, okay.  

JOEY:
 all right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way.  the trail?

ROSS:
 what trail?

JOEY:
  trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! 

ROSS:
 oh, i-i dont think theres any trail.

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issacs sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebes friends with rachel. and thats the trail, i did it! 

PHOEBE:
  strips to leg number one, 

MONICA:
 did that!

PHOEBE:
 grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.

MONICA:
 okay. 

PHOEBE:
 was it not pain-free?

MONICA:
 no. it was painful. oh my god , they should call it pain-zine, now with a little wax.

PHOEBE:
 huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.

MONICA:
 thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. but hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips? 

ROSS:
 

 is this about me taking your watch?

ROSS:
 you took my watch?

 im sorry, i do that.

ROSS:
 just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?

 oh no. i feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.

ROSS:
 exactly. so you didnt, didnt mention anything to issac right?

 oh, well i tell issac everything.

ROSS:
 you tell, of course you do. issac. issac. hey, issac. issac, hi! y'know we havent actually met...

 you dog!

ROSS:
 yes, i suppose i am a dog. but issac, see i-i happen to have a girlfriend.

 oh right, that rachel chick from the coffee place.

ROSS:
 yeah, thats the one. listen, i dont want to hurt her.

 oh, hey, man i know, doesnt matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.

ROSS:
 yeah. listen, can you keep this information to yourself?

 aw, no problem dude. y'know we got to look out for each other. were the same, you and me.

ROSS:
 actually, no, were not.

 yeah, we are.

ROSS:
 no, were not.

 yeah, we are.

ROSS:
 no, were not!!

 okay, were not.

ROSS:
 right.

 but, we are.

ROSS:
 fine. i just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister.

 i can promise not to tell her again. 

ROSS:
 

 uh-huh.

ROSS:
 we met at phoebes birthday party, im, im ross geller.

 you did a bad thing!

ROSS:
 yes, i did.

 very bad!

ROSS:
 very bad.

 very, very bad.

ROSS:
 im agreeing with you. did you, listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet?

 no.

ROSS:
 okay, jasmine, please, please dont. i love my girlfriend very much, and i want more than anything to just work it out with her. okay?

 all right.

ROSS:
 thank you, thank you.

 but you should probably talk to my roommate, because i told him and he knows phoebe too.

ROSS:
  

ROSS:
 gunther! gunther. gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place.

 im sorry. was i not supposed to?  commercial break  

MONICA:
 ow!

PHOEBE:
 oh!!

MONICA:
 ow!! ow!!

PHOEBE:
 ow!!!

 ow!!!!!!! ow-ow-ow-ow!  

PHOEBE:
 were all right.

MONICA:
 its okay, its okay.

PHOEBE:
 were all right.

MONICA:
 we were just waxing our legs.

CHANDLER:
 off?!!

PHOEBE:
 for your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well i dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely.

JOEY:
 yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, thats all. i mean, come on, its just a little wax.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, come here.  

CHANDLER:
 oh, thats mature.

JOEY:
 okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh.

MONICA:
 thats right.  

ROSS:
   

RACHEL:
 i cant talk to you. i cant even look at you right now!

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 nothing, nothing.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 rachel? 

RACHEL:
 just get away from me!

ROSS:
 no, it was a mistake! i made a mistake! okay?

RACHEL:
 a mistake?! what were you trying to put it in? her purse?! 

PHOEBE:
 whe-where did he put it?! 

RACHEL:
 ross, you had sex with another woman! 

MONICA:
 oh my god.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....

MONICA:
 oh!!  you didnt tell us?!

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 no!!

RACHEL:
 just get out! now!!

ROSS:
 no!! no!! i wanna stay. i wanna talk about this.

RACHEL:
 okay! all right! how was she? 

CHANDLER:
 uh-oh. 

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 was she good? 

JOEY:
 dont answer that. 

RACHEL:
 come on ross! you said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk about it!! how was she?

ROSS:
 she was... 

JOEY:
 awful! horrible!

CHANDLER:
 she was not good. not good.

JOEY:
 she was nothing compared to you. 

ROSS:
 she, she was different. 

JOEY:
 ewwwww!

CHANDLER:
 uh-oh. 

RACHEL:
 good different?

ROSS:
 nobody likes change. 

ROSS:
 what? okay, okay, okay, okay. 

PHOEBE:
 should we do something?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, never cheat on rachel. 

ROSS:
 im sorry, okay, im sorry. i wa-i was disgusted with myself, and this morning i was so, i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy, and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.

RACHEL:
 whoa!! whoa, whoa, wait a minute. what time did your little friend leave?  was in there, when i was in there?! 

ROSS:
 listen. oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!

RACHEL:
 and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!   

ROSS:
 look, i didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. i thought we were broken up. 

RACHEL:
 we were on a break!

ROSS:
 that, for all i knew would, could last forever. that to me is a break-up.

RACHEL:
 you think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality?

ROSS:
 look, im not trying to get out of anything, okay. i thought our relationship was dead!

RACHEL:
 well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake! 

JOEY:
 y'know what, i dont think we should listen to this anymore.  

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 why not?! 

MONICA:
 because theyll know weve been listening. 

RACHEL:
 god! and to have to hear about it from gunther!!

ROSS:
 come on! like i wanted him to tell you, i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didnt happen!

RACHEL:
 oh, that is so sweet. i think im falling in love with you all over again. 

CHANDLER:
 y'know what, i think we can go out there. i mean they have more important things to worry about.

JOEY:
 yeah, well be fine. 

ROSS:
 look rachel, i wanted to tell you, i thought i should, i-i did, and then chandler and joey convinced me not to. 

CHANDLER:
  ever.  

PHOEBE:
 hi, its phoebe. listen someones gonna have to take my 9:00

15 now, and im not there. 

ROSS:
 dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if i didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with mark?

RACHEL:
 all right. lets say i had slept with mark. would you have been able to forgive me?

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 youd be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....

ROSS:
  okay, yeah, i would have been devastated but, i would still want to be with you. because its, i mean its you. 

 ohhhhh! 

ROSS:
 what? come on rach, tell me what youre thinking?

RACHEL:
 im thinking, im gonna order a pizza.

ROSS:
 order a pizza like, i forgive you?  

JOEY:
 oh man, pizza? i like pizza.   put olives on the pizza.

PHOEBE:
 we could eat the wax! its organic.

CHANDLER:
 oh great, food with hair on it.

PHOEBE:
 no, not the used wax.

CHANDLER:
 because that would be crazy? 

ROSS:
 hey, can i, can i get in on that? because im kinda hungry myself.

RACHEL:
 fine. 

ROSS:
 no anchovies.

RACHEL:
 with ah, extra anchovies.

ROSS:
 thats okay, ill just pick em off.

RACHEL:
 yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce? 

ROSS:
 you can have the last piece, if you want.

RACHEL:
 well, i should think so. you slept with someone. 

 hey, thats not so 

PHOEBE:
 theyre gonna get through this, arent they?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, come on, its ross and rachel, theyve got too.

MONICA:
 what if they dont? 

JOEY:
 you think i need a new walk?

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 well y'know, ive been walking the same way since high school. y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. i think i need a take notice walk.

CHANDLER:
 are you actually saying these words? 

ROSS:
 what, now youre not even taking to me?   look rachel, i-im sorry, okay, im sorry, i was out of my mind. i thought id lost you, i didnt know what to do. come on! come on, how insane must i have been to do something like this? huh? i-i dont cheat right, i, thats not me, im not joey! 

JOEY:
 whoa-ho-ho!   yeah, okay.

MONICA:
 hey. its three in the morning. they dont know that ive come home yet. you notice how neither one of them are wondering where i am.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved. 

ROSS:
 y'know what, y'know what, im-im not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. youre the one that bailed on us. youre the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!

RACHEL:
 thats....

ROSS:
 thats what?!

RACHEL:
 that is neither here nor there.

ROSS:
 okay, well here we are. now were in a tough spot again, rach. what do you want to do? how do you want to handle it? huh? do you wanna fight for us? or, do you wanna bail?  stupid, stupid thing. okay? and im sorry, i wish i could take it back, but i cant.  throwing away something we know is so damn good. rachel, i love you so much.  

RACHEL:
 no ross!!  just kiss me and think youre gonna make it all go away, okay? it doesnt work that way. it doesnt just make it better. okay?

ROSS:
 okay, okay, okay.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
  there was nothing so big that we couldnt work past it together...

RACHEL:
 yeah, what the hell did i know!

ROSS:
 look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. okay,  without you.  face, and this heart. your good heart rach,   and, and....

RACHEL:
  now. i used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. god, and now i just cant stop picturing with her, i cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, ross. its just changed, everything. forever. 

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 then how come it is? closing credits 

PHOEBE:
 theyve been quiet for a long time.

JOEY:
 maybe she killed him?

CHANDLER:
 lets go.  can finally emerge from their cell. they all wave good bye, and start to walk quietly out, as monica goes and puts a blanket on rachel. joey starts walking all hunched over and 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 can i see the comics?

CHANDLER:
 this is the new york times.

JOEY:
 okay, may i see the comics? 

MONICA:
 guys. i thought you were taking ross to the game?

CHANDLER:
 we are. hes meeting us here.

MONICA:
 no! rachel is meeting us here.

PHOEBE:
 oh come on, they can be in the same room.

JOEY:
 yeah, you shoulda been there last night.

PHOEBE:
 why? what happened now?

JOEY:
 well ross was hangin out over at our place, rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from chandler....

CHANDLER:
 yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something.

JOEY:
 anyway! her and ross just started yelling at each other.

PHOEBE:
 wait. why was he yelling at her? hes the one who slept with someone else. 

JOEY:
 well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.

PHOEBE:
 whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross doesnt try to kidnap me after cub scouts.

PHOEBE:
 y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together, they never broke up. and we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....

JOEY:
 i had the same dream!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and nobody slept with that xerox girl. 

JOEY:
 oh, i had the opposite dream.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, i mean its been a week.

JOEY:
 yeah, i mean its never taken me a week to get over a relationship.

MONICA:
 its never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship. 

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 hey!

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 ah! 

 sooo!! anyway...

ROSS:
 umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so rachel and i broke up.

 oh god, ross i am so sorry.

ROSS:
 yeah, well.

 y'know what, i want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

ROSS:
 oh yeah, id love that.

 oh, great! me too.

ROSS:
 i guess it all started when rachel got this new job.   

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 okay.  every rest stop, and, and also 93?  that.

RACHEL:
 ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 no! no, i am not getting in a car with ross, we will just have to live here! 

PHOEBE:
 but if...

RACHEL:
 no you guys, i am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.

PHOEBE:
 oh good, oh joey and chandler are back. 

MONICA:
 so the going for help went well?

JOEY:
 oh yeah, smokey joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 pheebs? what, why are you whispering?

PHOEBE:
 i ate a bug. 

MONICA:
  penny. lets stock up. 

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 oh, now you want a favour?

PHOEBE:
 yes, please.

ROSS:
 well, oh, im sorry your car broke down pheebs, but im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?

  hang on a second. 

ROSS:
 no, im not gonna pick them up.

 listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk. okay? so you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.

ROSS:
 no, rachel doesnt want me to....

 look, i-i-i am sorry that rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what rachel did to you.

ROSS:
 yeah, youre right.

  what? 

ROSS:
 we were on a break!!! okay!!   yeah. where are you? ill find you.

ROSS:

MONICA:
 

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 oh come on man! at least let me finish this last one.

 okay, but only if you give me a drag.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

 oh dark mother, once again i suckle at your smokey tit.  

CHANDLER:
 no-no, why dont you hang on to that one.  takes away from him. he puts another cigarette in his mouth, and rachel takes it away 

CHANDLER:
 okay, thats like the least fun game ever.

RACHEL:
 well, im really sick of your smoking, so i brought something that is going to help you quit. 

CHANDLER:
 oh.   nope, that patch is no good.  

RACHEL:
 come on, its a hypnosis tape. this woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasnt smoked since.

ROSS:
 pffhah.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 nothing, its just that hypnosis is beyond crap.

RACHEL:
 ross, i watched you get hypnotised in atlantic city.

ROSS:
 hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! okay.

RACHEL:
 oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe-out on your butt cheeks.

PHOEBE:
 all right, y'know forget hypnosis. the way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.

CHANDLER:
 or what my father called thursday night. opening credits 

ROSS:
 here you go.

RACHEL:
 oh, y'know what, i didnt want cinnamon on this.

ROSS:
 sorry.  

 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!! 

 hi!

PHOEBE:
 frank! hi!

 how are you?

PHOEBE:
 what are you doing here?

 oh, well y'know, i wouldve called but i lost your phone number and then ah, my mom locked me out of the house so i couldnt find it. and then, i tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. so...

PHOEBE:
 what happened?

 ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.

PHOEBE:
 but, also, what happened between you and your mom?

 well, we got into a fight cause ah, she said i was to immature to get married.

PHOEBE:
 your getting married?!

 oh, yeah!

 wow!

PHOEBE:
 my little brothers getting married!!

 oh, i knew youd be so cool about this. all right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?

PHOEBE:
 do i?

 do you?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i do, yeah.

 okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck.  gonna, im gonna get my ah, my fiancée man!

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one of us to get married.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, isnt it fantastic?

MONICA:
 yeah, ah, but pheebs dont you think hes a little young to get married?

PHOEBE:
 what, hes 18.

ROSS:
 exactly, itll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.

JOEY:
 yeah, or-or to get a hooker.

CHANDLER:
 always illegal joe.

   hey! hey! this is ah, my fiancée, mrs. knight. 

 y'know it-its funny, um, frank told me so much about you, but your not how i pictured you at all.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, im a big surprise. 

MONICA:
 so, um, how-how did you guys meet?

 well um, i was in ah mrs. knights ah, i mean alice, sorry, alice, i always do that. i was in her ah, home ec class.

 and he was my best student.

 yeah, she was my best teacher. 

 ohhh. 

CHANDLER:
 if that doesnt keep kids in school, what will?

ROSS:
 and so now you guys are gonna be married?

 yeah. y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god!! great!

PHOEBE:
 wow, kids. frank, are you sure youre ready for that?

 i mean, how hard can it be? y'know, i mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesnt want babies right? and besides y'know, i never had a dad around, and ah, now-now i always will, cause y'know, itll be me. right?

 y'know, i mean, really we do realise that theres an age difference between us.

PHOEBE:
 oh good! okay. cause you were acting like you didnt.

 oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?  

 you are falling fast asleep. deeper. deeper. deeper. you are now completely asleep. you dont need to smoke. cigarettes dont control you. you are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. a strong, confident woman. 

MONICA:
 and y'know what, i just realised, in the last year ive only gone out with two guys, richard and julio. you gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.

RACHEL:
 well, that shouldnt be a problem. i mean i work in fashion and all i meet are eligible straight men.

MONICA:
 

 yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.

MONICA:
 havent you and i covered that topic?

 hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.

MONICA:
 aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that i serve you food.

 well, if that were true, id dating my aunt ruth. and the two times we went out were just plain awkward.  me, dont you?

RACHEL:
  that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what i mean. that wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. 

MONICA:
 i mean really, think about it.

 ho-ho, i will. 

PHOEBE:
 no, i know, i know, that this is franks life,   y'know. y'know, i dont want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong!

ROSS:
 pheebs, what, is it the age thing?

PHOEBE:
 no-no, oh, im fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat! 

JOEY:
 pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

PHOEBE:
 but, i mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! this is not fair to frank,  it-its not fair to the babies, and y'know what, its not good home economics.

JOEY:
 well, have-have you told him how you feel?

PHOEBE:
 yes. not out loud.

ROSS:
 pheebs, if you dont tell him, soon hes gonna be married, and then youre gonna hate yourself.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but if i do tell him, then hes gonna hate myself. i mean look at him and his mom, i cant.  him out of it.

 no-no-no-no-no.  

PHOEBE:
 come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, i have everything to lose. do you want me to lose everything? everything?!

 no.

PHOEBE:
 okay, im gonna go get frank. 

JOEY:
 so, were walking down the street and i turn to you and i say, hey, lets go hang out at totally nude nudes, remember? and then, and then, you turn to me and say, nah, lets just hang out at your place. well, that was a nice move dumb ass.  

RACHEL:
 i think you should definitely go out with this guy.

MONICA:
 nah, he doesnt do anything for me.

RACHEL:
 monica, last saturday night, what happened on walker: texas ranger?

MONICA:
 well, umm, walker was looking for this big bus load of kids. 

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 as a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. his number is on the check, he just did so id call him.

CHANDLER:
   

MONICA:
 thats bill clinton.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 oh my god, monicas gonna go out with a millionaire. 

MONICA:
 im not gonna go out with him.

RACHEL:
 oh my god, i cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.

MONICA:
 or incredibly offensive.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, sure, that too.  

CHANDLER:
  

ROSS:
 all were saying is dont rush into anything.

JOEY:
 yeah, come on, think about it. youre 18, okay, shes 44, when youre 36, shes gonna be 88.

 what, you dont think i know that?

JOEY:
 look, the point is, theres a lot of women out there you havent even had sex with yet!

ROSS:
 yeah, he-hes right, hes right. this is your time y'know, yeah, youre young, youre-youre weird, chicks dig that.

 okay, but isnt sex better when its with one person that you really, really care about.

JOEY:
 yeah, in a poem maybe.

ROSS:
 no the mans right, thats what i had with rachel.

 you dont have it anymore?

ROSS:
 no, i ah, i slept with someone else.

 okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?

ROSS:
 it didnt.

 okay, so what you used to have with rachel, is what ive got with alice.

JOEY:
 now, wh-what, what is that like?

 its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.

ROSS:
 yeah, yeah.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 dont ask me, i had it and i blew it!

JOEY:
 well, i want it!

 you can have it!

JOEY:
 i dont know, maybe i cant. i mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.

ROSS:
 oh, no! no!

 its out there man! ive seen it! i got it!!

JOEY:
 then you hold on to it!!

 all right, man!!

JOEY:
 all right, congratulations you lucky bastard!   

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 i couldnt help it, there love is so pure.

PHOEBE:
 well then, 

ROSS:
 im the ring bearer.  walks to his bedroom. hes just got out of the shower and has the towel wrapped around himself high across his chest, and another towel wrapped around his head, like  commercial break 

PHOEBE:
 hi! oh, alice, hi! thanks. im so glad you could come, cause ive got a real umm, home ec emergency.  

 oh my god, who died on this?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i know. its a real mustard-tastrophe. can you help me?

 absolutely. okay, first well start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesnt work we can go back to

PHOEBE:
 y'know what, forget it. its ruined. 

 oh no-no, never say that. if we cant get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.

PHOEBE:
 or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother frank.  

 okay, thats great, but can we make it smaller? can we make it fit on the head of a pin? i love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.

 got it. yeah all right. yeah, okay. 

 you have a miss monica geller here.

 uh, absolutely, yeah, send her in. 

MONICA:
 what the hell is this? 

 hang on a second.  the morning. 

MONICA:
 seriously, what is this supposed to mean?

 well, yknow, i never know how much to tip.

MONICA:
 youre supposed to double the tax. not double the tax of romania. i mean, whats-whats the deal? are you, are you trying to buy me? is this the way you get girls to go out with you?

 umm, im still here.

  didnt leave you that tip, you wouldnt of come down here, we wouldnt be having this argument, and there wouldnt be this ah, heat between us.

MONICA:
 what?!

 come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. cause you used to be like the chef, and i was the customer, and now were like this-this couple that fights.

MONICA:
 okay, umm, youre a loon.

 look, forget the check, okay.  youre great. come on, what do you say?

MONICA:
 i dont know.

 why not?

MONICA:
 cause i dont want to encourage this kind of behaviour.

 one meal! thats all im asking for. please? we go out, we eat, and if you dont have a good time, i give you ten grand, we call it even.  

  just put the mail down. its-its me!

PHOEBE:
 okay. whoa, sorry. why were you just like all in the dark?

 oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that i thought id curl up in it. is that all right?

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah, sure. so, how was your day?

 oh, well just probably the worst one since ive been alive.

PHOEBE:
 what umm, what happened?

 umm, alice ah, she ah, called it off.

PHOEBE:
 oh no. did umm, did she say why?

 uh, no, not really, just that i was too young, y'know, but i dont see how i could all of the sudden be too young, cause im older than i was when we first got together.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, yeah, no, i dont, i dont know. but, y'know what, maybe its just all for the best?

 yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!

PHOEBE:
 oh, sweetie, oh. 

 y'know, i just was finally happy y'know. for the first time in my life! after my dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! i can, its still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with alice all that stuff kinda went away. and now its, and now its gone and i dont know why!

PHOEBE:
 uh, well i can tell you why. its, its because of me. but, y'know what, i only did it because i love you. okay?

 what?

PHOEBE:
 umm, well i, i kinda had a little chat with alice, and i sort of made her see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know. and youre gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.

 wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?

PHOEBE:
 okay.

 well, you, wait no, my mother didnt want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, but.

 wait, y'know what, i-i came to you because i thought youd understand! oh no!! y'know, i would storm out of here right now if-if i had some money, or a place to go  

RACHEL:
 oh my god! the millionaires here!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 guys, please, im just gonna have dinner with him. okay?

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.

MONICA:
 i know!!

CHANDLER:
 okay, then get the lobster!

MONICA:
 

 hi.

RACHEL:
 hi!!

JOEY:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hi! 

JOEY:
 hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?

MONICA:
 and thats why, im not inviting you in for a drink.   bye.

 oh-no-no-no-no.

RACHEL:
 just one drink?!

MONICA:
 

 hey, you like pizza?

MONICA:
 oh, thats sounds great.

 i know a great little place.  

 youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!

MONICA:
 oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. now is, is that enough lire?

 ahh, id throw another thousand on that.

MONICA:
 why, how much is that?

 thats about 60 cents.  

JOEY:
 every night!!   

 you do not need to smoke. cigarettes dont control you. you are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.   

PHOEBE:
 hey, frank. look, okay, i know that you think i did like this totally evil thing, but i so didnt. theres someone here who can explain this better than i can.

 hi frank.

 hi, mrs. knight.

 phoebes right frank. i know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it. i-i-i was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.  what it is?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but not just that.

 right, not just that. umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less

PHOEBE:
 none the less.

 none the less. umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want. 

PHOEBE:
 thats right, exactly.  kiss, thats good.   okay, no, the important thing is that you see what im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong.   okay, ive decided im gonna let this happen! okay, can i just get my purse?  closing credits 

 cigarettes dont control you. you are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. 

 here you go.

RACHEL:
 thank you.

  to a movie with me sometime. as my lover! nnnsch, to out there. maybe youd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? as my lover.

 

RACHEL:
 hi! all right, lets go shoppin!!

 um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something i need to say.

RACHEL:
 oh, okay.

 ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.  since you were with ross, i-i didnt do anything about it. but, now that youre not, id really like to ask you out sometime. so-so thats-thats what im doing, now. 

RACHEL:
 wow! umm....  

 i dropped a cup. opening credits  

 ...so y'know, thats why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. y'know, so you could be like-like, wash my car. clean my room. its not gonna be able to do any of those things, but itll understand what youre saying.

MONICA:
 oh, this is so great.

 yeah, it was.

MONICA:
 all right then.   bye. 

MONICA:
 hello, people who do not live here.

 hi! hello!

MONICA:
 i gave you a key for emergencies!

PHOEBE:
 we were out of doritos.

ROSS:
 hey, howd the date go with mr. millionaire?

CHANDLER:
 mr. millionaire, new from snooty playthings! third wife sold separately.

MONICA:
 hes great! i mean we have such a good time together! hes so funny, and sooo sweet, and im not attracted to him at all!!

ROSS:
 still?!

MONICA:
 noo!! its driving me crazy. i mean every other way hes like the perfect guy, he has everything. plus! he actually has everything.

CHANDLER:
 life-sized imperial storm troopers from sharper image?

MONICA:
 two.

CHANDLER:
 wow!! can joey and i put them on and fight?

JOEY:
  baddie! oh mommie, oh daddie, i am a big old baddie!  

ROSS:
 i guess he musta gotten the part in that play.

 oh.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, either that, or gloria estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you. 

 joe. hows it going?

JOEY:
 good.   hey.

 hi.

JOEY:
 oh, so youre playing adrienne, huh?

 yes. are you one of the retarded cousins?

JOEY:
 oh, no. ah, i playing your husband, victor. im joey tribianni.

 hi, nice to meet you. kate miller.   

JOEY:
 so the ah, plays pretty great, huh?

 oh, yeah. i love jennifer van murrays work. shes so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the american middle class.

JOEY:
 oh, forget about it. she rocks!

 where do i know you from?

JOEY:
 dr. drake remoray. days of our lives. voted most datable neurosurgeon by teen beat.

 no, thats not it. so, youre a soap actor? well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?

JOEY:
 hey, ive done plays before. im a serious actor.

 that info-mercial! for the milk carton spout thing! youre-youre-youre the guy that doesnt know how to pour milk!!

JOEY:
 see, i actually can pour milk, but i got you believing that i couldnt. now, see, thats acting.

 right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.

JOEY:
 yeah, that was real.  

PHOEBE:
 wow! i cannot believe mark asked you out.

RACHEL:
 i know.

PHOEBE:
 what, so what are you gonna tell him?

RACHEL:
 well, i told him i would think about it, but im gonna tell him no.

PHOEBE:
 huh. 

RACHEL:
 i mean i think id say no to anybody right now.   oh, but it was so strange. i mean im standing there with this charming, cute guy, whos asking me to go out with him, which im allowed to do, and i felt guilty. y'know, like id be cheating on ross or something.

PHOEBE:
 wow. so, okay, maybe that means that, youre not over ross yet and you have issues with your father.

RACHEL:
 i dont have any issues with my father.

PHOEBE:
 okay, so its probably just the ross thing then. 

JOEY:
 i hate this woman!! i hate her! she told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. okay, and whenever i cant do it, theyre all like-like laughing at me.

ROSS:
 

 hey!

ROSS:
 so rachel called. wants to see me. going over in a minute.

JOEY:
 wow, what-what do you think she wants?

ROSS:
 well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.

CHANDLER:
 its possible. you are very loveable, id miss you if i broke up with you. 

ROSS:
 then be supportive like a guy.

CHANDLER:
  

ROSS:
 hi.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 so, youre like a zillionaire? 

CHANDLER:
 and youre our age. youre our age.

PHOEBE:
 y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.

 what like pete dakota?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, or, or, or, mississ-pete.

JOEY:
 oh, oh, i got it! pete-chicago.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

 okay.

CHANDLER:
 youre our age!

 

MONICA:
 absolutely!   now get out of here you!!  out of places i can touch him! look, is there something wrong with me? i mean why am i only attracted to guys where theres no future? either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! i mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, kinda. 

 happy?! is that what im supposed to be vic? happy?

JOEY:
 well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! huh? because i sure as hell cant figure it out! i talk to you and nothin. you look at me, and its nothin. 

 tasty! im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice.

 i have a question about this scene.

 yes?

 well, i dont understand why adriennes attracted to victor.

 peel the onion. first of all, hes good looking.

JOEY:
 yeah.

 i think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.

JOEY:
 oh, hey, how about this one. ah, its says so in the script! y'know ah, i-i dont know why my character likes you either, i mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.

 it doesnt say that in the script.

JOEY:
 it does in mine! 

CHANDLER:
 i can blow dry it. i can put gel on it. it doesnt matter, i still wind up with this little  on the middle part of my head. its so annoying. does it bug you?

ROSS:
 you bug me.  

CHANDLER:
 is there any chance you didnt see that? commercial break  

CHANDLER:
 ross! you gotta stop! okay?! you cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! youre gonna get peep eye!

ROSS:
 i knew it! i knew it! i always knew she liked him! y'know, shed say no, but here we are! right? we just broke up, first thing she does!

CHANDLER:
 you didnt just break up.

ROSS:
 hey, its been like three weeks!

CHANDLER:
 you slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. i mean bullets have left guns slower!

ROSS:
 here they come, here they come. oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, im gonna kill myself, i swear. i cant, i cant watch this.   come on, date over! date over! uh-oh, here we go, shes going in.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

ROSS:
 shes going in. wait! hes going in! hes going in!! the doors closed! i, i cant see anything but the door closed!!

CHANDLER:
 and the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.

ROSS:
 okay, i have to do something. i mean, i have, i have to stop it!

CHANDLER:
 stop what?!

ROSS:
 i dont know, but i ah, i have the feeling that my being there will do it. ill go over and i will borrow something. juice!! i need juice!!  

CHANDLER:
 no!! you cant!! 

ROSS:
 look, they must be stopped!

CHANDLER:
 i am your friend, and i am not gonna let you do this!!  strong!

ROSS:
 i need juice! people need juice!!

CHANDLER:
 look man!

ROSS:
 people need juice!

CHANDLER:
 listen to me!!   

ROSS:
 juice, i need...

CHANDLER:
 shes moving on! okay, if its not this guy, its gonna be somebody else! and unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! okay, man? its over.

ROSS:
 yeah, okay. 

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

ROSS:
 its just i miss her so much.

CHANDLER:
 i know.  

 why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?

RACHEL:
 oh. thats so monica can keep track. that way if one on them is missing, she can be like, wheres number 27?!  

RACHEL:
 y'know what?

 no. and i dont think im gonna want to.

RACHEL:
 i cant do this.

 yep. yep, thats what i didnt want to know.

RACHEL:
 well, oh, mark, im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? im just doing it to get back at ross. im sorry, its not very fair to you.

 ahh! fair, schmair! y'know? look, if you want to get back at ross, i am here for you. really? no-no, i say-i say, i say we get back at him right on this couch. right here!

RACHEL:
 oh god. im sorry about this.

 thats okay.

RACHEL:
 you sure?

 yeah. i can just go home and get back at him by myself. 

 ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. and so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. it is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...

 

MONICA:
 sure.

 where are we? 

MONICA:
  say, midget rodeo.

 just tell me the truth.

MONICA:
 okay. umm, y'know, i dont think, i dont think i told you this, but umm, i just got out of a really serious relationship.

 oh, yeah. wasnt that like a year ago?

MONICA:
 so i did tell you. okay, y'know, that really isnt the thing. umm, the thing is that, right now im just in a place in my life where i need to focus on me. y'know what i mean?

 oh, yeah. i know that.

MONICA:
 i so wanna be attracted to you.

 but youre not. okay, good.

MONICA:
 im sorry.

 y'know what, dont be. this is not, dont be, cause its not so bad.

MONICA:
 its not?

 i know im no john bon jovi,  who find attractive, im just, i think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.

MONICA:
 well, um, look i-i dont want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy i just told i wasnt attracted too.

 yeah, stupidly charming isnt it? well listen lets, you wanna get something to eat? cause this place is kinda depressing.  

 and the man who made all this possible... mr. peter becker.

     

CHANDLER:
 i dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.    

CHANDLER:
   uh-oh, what did she do now?

JOEY:
 just because she went to yale drama, she thinks shes like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!

CHANDLER:
 ah, sliced bread, a wonderful lady macbeth.

JOEY:
 god, i just, i hate her! i hate her!! with her, oh, im so talented. and oh, im so pretty, and ooh, i smell so good.

CHANDLER:
 i think somebody has a crush on somebody.

JOEY:
 hey, chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! y'know?

CHANDLER:
 im talking about you. you big, big freak.

JOEY:
 oh. 

CHANDLER:
 hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! if you were in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!

JOEY:
 oh, yeah?! then how come i keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?! 

 happy?! is that what im supposed to be vic? happy?

JOEY:
 well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! huh? because i sure as hell cant figure it out! i talk to you and its nothin. you look at me, and nothin. 

 you guys make me fly! high! okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 hey, rach, how was work?

RACHEL:
 oh, great. although i did sit down where there wasnt a chair.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh, well, i guess i had that one coming. im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... 

MONICA:
 something wrong?

RACHEL:
   no. nothing.  closing credits  

CHANDLER:
 so, ahh, what kind of powers would gold man have?

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 ahh, his work is done.

CHANDLER:
 okay, lets play my game now.

CHANDLER:
 wait a minute, wait. youre telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!

JOEY:
 yeah! oh my god! 

MONICA:
 wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?

JOEY:
 oh, you have no idea. and-and when were on stage i get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and its like somebodys ripping out my heart!

PHOEBE:
 oh, its so great to see you feeling like this!

ROSS:
 

 hey!

ROSS:
 monica, uh dad called this morning and ah, aunt silvia passed away.

MONICA:
 yes!! yes! yeah, yeah, yeah!

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 wait, am i missing something though? cause i thought death was something thats supposed to be sad, in a way.

ROSS:
 well ah, aunt silvia was, well not a nice person.

MONICA:
 oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!   and im sorry she died. did dad say i get the dollhouse?

ROSS:

MONICA:
 i get the dollhouse!

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 really?! really?!

MONICA:
 any time you want. y'know, when i was younger, all i wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! it was to be looked at, but never played with.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 whats this?

PHOEBE:
 thats a dog, every house should have a dog.

MONICA:
 not one that can pee on the roof.

PHOEBE:
 well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 no, no, thats the ghost for the attic.

MONICA:
 i dont want a ghost.

PHOEBE:
 well, nobody wants a ghost. but youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient indian burial ground.

ROSS:
 wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient indian burial ground? that would never happen.

PHOEBE:
 okay, obviously you dont know much about the u.s. government.

RACHEL:
 

 hello.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 the licorice room, you can eat all the furniture. and, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.

ROSS:
 this is the coolest house ever!! 

PHOEBE:
 hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?  

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp new york evening. 

RACHEL:
 hmm.

CHANDLER:
 of course, i didnt get to enjoy any of that, because joannas such a big, dull dud! 

 chandler is fantastic!!

RACHEL:
 what?!

 oh god, we just clicked! yknow how people just click? like he came by to pick me up, and i opened the door, and it was just like, click! did he tell you?

RACHEL:
 oh, i....

 oh, and hes got such a good heart! doesnt he have a good heart?

RACHEL:
 oh, i know...

 oh, i know and hes soo sweet! listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.

 isnt this great?!

 dont spoil it. 

JOEY:
 come on baby, dont go. please? what do you say? 

  one-one sec.  there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! 

JOEY:
 

 he happens to be brilliant. which is more than i can say for that sweater youre dating.

JOEY:
 hey, im not interested in her sweater! its whats underneath her sweater that counts. and besides, since ah, since when do you care who im going out with?

 i dont care. why, do you want me to care?

JOEY:
 do you want me to want you to care?

 do you?

JOEY:
 what?

  it up where we left off. 

JOEY:
 come on baby, dont go. please? what do you say?

 ive got no reason to stay.  

 stop!! stop it! you must stop! you are bad actors! this is a terrible play! ill see you in the morning. 

 i cant believe we go on in, in a week.

JOEY:
 hey, its gonna be all right.

  and paint mugs?

JOEY:
 what?

 you know! at the place i told you about last night?

JOEY:
 oh, yeah, with the mug painting. yeah. i was so listening to that. but ah, y'know what, i think i kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.

 oh, okay.

JOEY:
 okay. 

 ill see you tomorrow. 

JOEY:
 okay.

 gnight. 

JOEY:
 

 yeah, i guess. look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?

JOEY:
 i dont know.

 well umm, maybe if it had more heat.

JOEY:
 how do you mean?

 well, adrians looking for a reason to stay, right? victor cant just kiss her, hes gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?

JOEY:
 maybe he could slip her the tongue.

 or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah, and then adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.

 and then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!

JOEY:
 and then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!

 and then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal.... 

JOEY:
 something like that?

 yeah, thats pretty much what i had in mind.

JOEY:
 yeah. commercial break  

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 hi.

JOEY:
  

ROSS:
 hi.

JOEY:
 hey. 

ROSS:
 its a little early to be drinkin.

JOEY:
 no-no, things ah, finally happened with kate.

ROSS:
 ohhhhh!

MONICA:
 youre kidding?! thats great!

JOEY:
 oh, it was so amazing. after the 

MONICA:
 oh my.

JOEY:
 yep. i just, i just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. and then i knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this.  

CHANDLER:
  wrong. okay? all i said was, this was fun. lets do it again sometime. ill give you a call.

RACHEL:
 ohh, gee. i wonder why she thinks youre going to call her?

CHANDLER:
 thats what you say at the end of a date.

RACHEL:
 you cant just say, nice to meet you, good night?

CHANDLER:
 to her face? look its the end of the date, im standing there, i know all shes waiting for is for me to say ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. i cant help it, its a compulsion.

MONICA:
 come on rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt mean hes going to call. hasnt it ever happened to you?

RACHEL:
 well, they always called.

MONICA:
 hmm, bite me. 

 

RACHEL:
 no. sorry.

 why?! why?! he said hed call. why hasnt he called?

 maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.

 sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. why hasnt he called, rachel? why?

RACHEL:
 okay, okay. umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.

 awkward? why should he feel awkward?

RACHEL:
 well...

 the only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?

RACHEL:
 no. i...

 because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that. 

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 multiple, so many paper cuts.

RACHEL:
 why hasnt he called rachel? why? why? i dont understand. why? he said hell call. why? why? chandler im telling you she has flipped out, shes gone crazy!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 come on, this isnt funny. she thinks its my fault that you havent called her. you have to call her!

CHANDLER:
 look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, in case you didnt notice, i dont like you!

RACHEL:
 well then youre going to have to take her out again.

CHANDLER:
 nooo!! shes really dull! and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!

RACHEL:
 i dont care! i dont care! you are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. and, i dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!

CHANDLER:
 all right! fine! but its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! and from now on i get my own dates, i dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again!

RACHEL:
 thats fine!

CHANDLER:
 thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.

RACHEL:
 i know. 

ROSS:
 mon?

MONICA:
   something and turns around to see phoebes dollhouse smoking. he runs over and takes 

ROSS:
 oh, fire! there, theres a fire! fire!!  to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since monica is in the shower the water pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. in desperation he takes the half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesnt work. he then picks up the dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the bathroom and use the shower to put it out. he kicks open the door and we hear monica  

JOEY:
 hey.

 hi.

JOEY:
 so i ah, talked to lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. did you ah, did you talk to marshall?

 about what?

JOEY:
 y'know, about what happened with us.

 nooo. and theres really no reason he should find out, so ah lets not make a big deal about it, okay?

JOEY:
 what are you talking about? it was a big deal. i mean, come on you cant tell me last night didnt mean something to you. i-i was there, youre not that good an actress.

 look umm, i, i was, i was just caught up in the moment. thats all it was. joey, im-im sorry you feel bad, but havent you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?

JOEY:
 nooo.

 

 hi, lauren.

JOEY:
 hi, lauren.

 hi, pig!  

ROSS:
 sorry i ah, i scared you in there.

MONICA:
 oh, thats okay. by the way, i was just checking the shower massager.

ROSS:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
  fire.

PHOEBE:
 what?! oh my...  happened?!

ROSS:
 well, we believe it originated here.   in the aroma room.

PHOEBE:
 all right. did everyone get out okay?

MONICA:
 well, the giraffes okay. and so is the pirate.

PHOEBE:
 ohh. what is this?  

ROSS:
 no phoebe, dont look! you dont want to see whats under there!!

PHOEBE:
  foster puppets!     

CHANDLER:
 its not a big deal. its, just its right here, 

 well, thanks again for lunch.

CHANDLER:
  pleasant.

CHANDLER:
 the food there was, was great.

 wasnt it?

CHANDLER:
 so take care.

 you too.

CHANDLER:
 well, this was great. ill give you a call. we should do it again sometime. 

 great! im looking forward to it. rachel, any messages?

RACHEL:
 sophies desk. 

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 noo! 

RACHEL:
 chandler!!

CHANDLER:
 look, im sorry. okay? im weak, and pathetic, and sorry.

RACHEL:
 okay, you are going to tell her and youre going to tell her now. 

CHANDLER:
 ahhhhim not going to call you.

 what?

CHANDLER:
 im sorry. im-im-im sorry that i said i was going to when im not. look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? and this isnt rachels fault. its me. i have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. i have issues with commitment, intimacy,  im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out.

 well, this isnt how i was hoping how this would end, but i guess i have to appreciate your honesty.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, o-okay.

 so...

CHANDLER:
 well this is great! ill give you a call! we should do it again sometime!  closing credits 

RACHEL:
 so whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 oh, so thats why the priest threw holy water on me.  should come out with ross and me, i mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about kate.

JOEY:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 no way!

CHANDLER:

  traditional easter gifts. some people insist on giving live chicks as presents.   unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys wont live to see the fourth of july.   because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.

JOEY:

MONICA:

MONICA:

 i bought a restaurant and i would like you to be the head chef.

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 i mean this has been like my dream since i got my first easy bake oven and opened easy monicas bakery. i mean i would kill for this job. i mean i can totally do this job, and god knows i paid my dues.  petes just doing this because he has a crush on me.

RACHEL:
 and youre still not attracted to him at all?

MONICA:
 hmm, no. i mean how can i accept a restaurant from him? i-i-i-i cant. i couldnt even accept a necklace from stu vincent in the seventh grade.

RACHEL:
 yeah, but mon thats totally different. he was youre health teacher.

MONICA:
 oh, please.  

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 yeah, come here!

MONICA:
 what-what was it you were gonna tell us? 

RACHEL:
 yeah. oh! was how you invented the cotton gin?!

ROSS:
 okay, good bye!  

CHANDLER:
 so um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.

PHOEBE:
 umm, oh, about three months.

CHANDLER:
 okay, so i guess thats about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 i got you something! open it! open it!

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?

CHANDLER:
 fowl? no. women? nooo.

PHOEBE:
 okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. they require constant care. they-they need just the right food, and lots and lots of love.

JOEY:
 oh, well no problem there.  

CHANDLER:
 easy lenny. 

 so? i mean have you thought about it?

MONICA:
 okay. heres the thing.

 oh no, not the thing. i hate the thing. whats the thing?

MONICA:
 i cant do it. im sorry, i wish i could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....

 wait, wait, wait, wait, thats-thats what youre worried about? if thats the problem, weve got no problem.

MONICA:
 huh?

 no! look, i was gonna tell you this over dinner, but i met somebody else. on my trip.

MONICA:
 oh?

 her names ann, shes a journalist. ahh, we met on the plane. she asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, i thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. yeah, i just, i mean i got, i got tired of waiting.

MONICA:
 oh, thats great! i mean im-im sorry, but im so happy for you. and now i can work for you!

 i guess you can.

MONICA:
 oh my god! oh, this is incredible! ohh!   all right, y'know what? im just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!

 all right.

MONICA:
 okay. 

 yeah, sure. good luck!

MONICA:
  through a doorway and out of sight. we then hear a big crash, and see monica roll past the  im okay!! im all right!!

PHOEBE:
 

 what?

PHOEBE:
 im just saying, this woman, i mean shes fictitious. no?

 why would you say that?

PHOEBE:
 cause youre still into monica. so you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...

 youre good. youre good!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, no, im fairly intuitive and psychic. its a substantial gift.

 listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?

PHOEBE:
 absolutely, oh i promise. tell her what?

 thanks a lot.

PHOEBE:
 no im serious. i mean im intuitive, but my memory sucks. 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 i stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!

JOEY:
 hey! who was up from 2 oclock this morning until 5 oclock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?

CHANDLER:
 you dont think i get up when you get up?

JOEY:
 ohhh, here it comes.

CHANDLER:
 yes, here it comes! im stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? well i dont think so mister!

JOEY:
 hey!! i need to relax! okay? i was working all day!

CHANDLER:
 and you dont think taking care of our chick is work?

JOEY:
 thats not what i said. okay, i just meant...

CHANDLER:
 i know what you meant!!  chick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too?

JOEY:
 i dont know, maybe we werent ready to have a chick.

CHANDLER:
 ill take her back tomorrow.

JOEY:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 yeah, but that was different. yknow? i mean, we were, we were going out then, now i think its weird.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ross! stop that!

ROSS:

MONICA:
 clogs.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 claws?!

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 i dont know! 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh, just go. youre never gonna get it!  hes on one leather chair, the chick is on the other. its watching yasmine 

CHANDLER:
 i know. see, yes. thats yasmine bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick. i love you both. but in very different ways.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
   ahh! what are you doing?! i thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.

CHANDLER:
 i did! but the store wouldnt take her back! so then i took her to the shelter, and you know what i found out?    

CHANDLER:
 if they cant find a home for her, they kill her! and im not gonna let that happen to little yasmine!

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 oh, jason? yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 i know, i know! i'm like playing the field. y'know? like, juggling two guys, i'm sowing my wild oats. y'know? y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.

JOEY:

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hi! 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.

JOEY:
 well what is it?!

ROSS:
 he couldn't even tell me! he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what? you should go to my guy, because when i went in there with my third nipple. he just lopped it right off. y'know? so i guess i'm lucky. i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.

ROSS:
 at least they knew what yours was. y'know, yours had a name.

JOEY:
 oh! maybe they'll name yours after you! y'know, they'll call it, the ross. and then people would be like, "awww, he's got a ross."

ROSS:
  

MONICA:
 pete's breaking up with me.

 what?!

MONICA:
 i just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from atlanta, we need to talk.

RACHEL:
 and?

MONICA:
 well that's it. people never say `we need to talk' unless it's something bad.

JOEY:
 whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.

MONICA:
 really?!

JOEY:
 yeah, maybe he just cheated on you. 

 ...and i know i'll never miss doing it, but i gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.

PHOEBE:
 that is so great! oh, i...   oh my god!

 whoa!

PHOEBE:
 

 ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!

PHOEBE:
 

 no, no?

PHOEBE:
 well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.  of here!

 w-w-w-wait! why?!

PHOEBE:
 well look, if i wanted to see a fireman, i would date one. okay?   

ROSS:
 th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. y'know? just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. y'know? you can take it off. just slice that baby right off!

 take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. 

ROSS:
 just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.

 well that's not a third nipple.

ROSS:
 no?

 first of all, it's on your ass.

ROSS:
 well then, what is it?!

 wait a minute, hold it.  will you come in here a moment?

 i'm with hamilton!

 he's good with rear things, bring him in too. 

MONICA:
  what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe i won't water his plants.

CHANDLER:
 well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe joey and i should water his plants. if y'know what i mean.

JOEY:
 or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.

PHOEBE:
  always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. it's making me crazy.

RACHEL:
 well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa-whoa. what ah, what happened to playing the field?

PHOEBE:
 well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. it's like i'm working in the field.

RACHEL:
 so pheebs, pick one of them.

MONICA:
 yeah. which one do you like more?

PHOEBE:
 well, vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. y'know? he's so burly, he's sooo very burly. 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 well sensitive is important, pick him.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 yes, but this is pete. okay? hes not like other people, on your first date he took you to rome. for most guys thats like a third or fourth date kinda thing.

MONICA:
 well if-if thats what it is, then its-its crazy.

ROSS:
 monicas right. were talking about getting married here. okay? she-she cant just rush into this.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 oh, so youre going with the teacher, huh?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i like vince a lot, y'know? but, its just jasons so sensitive, y'know? and in the long run, i think sensitive its just better than having just like a really, really, really nice   

 good luck! 

RACHEL:
 oh my god!!!   sorry, i was just imagining what itd be like to catch the money bouquet.  

PHOEBE:
 excuse me. umm, is vince here?

PHOEBE:

 uh-huh. g-good deal.

PHOEBE:
 im sorry.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, i didnt

  write in my journal. 

PHOEBE:
  

PHOEBE:
  you should go to my herbal guy.

ROSS:
 thank you, but i want to remove it pheebs. i dont want to make it savory.

MONICA:

ROSS:
 gimme this. 

RACHEL:
  resist.

MONICA:
 brides magazines?

RACHEL:
 yes, and i know that youd say no if he asked you, but im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this donna carin.  

PHOEBE:
   like for clubbing. 

MONICA:
 it is so weird, i know what i said, but uh, this morning, i was lying in bed i was, i was imagining what it would be like to say yes.   i know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean i cant. right? i mean im-im crazy about pete, and i know that we want the same things, and when i thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.

RACHEL:
 oh my god. 

MONICA:
 i know. 

PHOEBE:
 hey mon umm, if you do get married, can i bring two guests?

RACHEL:
 you didnt break up with that fireman?

PHOEBE:
 no, that was my way of telling you. well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.

RACHEL:
 wow!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

MONICA:
 so then, are you going to dump jason?

PHOEBE:
 well, yeah, because i have to break up with someone, and okay so jason is sensitive,   plus, vince has the body y'know?   so its really just about the math. 

PHOEBE:
 

 yeah, come on in.  

 so phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

ROSS:

 well, relax. if it makes you feel better, ive attended some of the finest medical schools in central america. well then, lets take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.  huh. as i suspected, its a koondis!

ROSS:
 whats a koondis?

 i dont know, whats a koondis with you?   please, lie down! ive got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.

ROSS:
 i guess its worth a try.

 oh sure, we should see resultswhoa!! clearly not the way to go!! 

ROSS:
 what?! what?!

 we appear to have angered it.

ROSS:
 we?! we angered it?!

 oh, i think i see the problem. and im afraid were gonna have to use a much stronger tool. 

ROSS:
 oh god!

  there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to

ROSS:
 ow!! 

 oops.

ROSS:
 what was, what was that?

 well its gone.

ROSS:

MONICA:

MONICA:

 and i feel like ive conquered the business world, and i feel like ive conquered the intellectual world, and now i-i have the most beautiful woman in the world.

MONICA:
 wow.

MONICA:

 its time for me to conquer the physical world.

MONICA:
 okay. 

 monica, i want to become 

MONICA:
 you wanna what?!

 i want to become the ultimate fighting champion! its the most intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!

MONICA:
 what are you talking about?

 okay, my trainer, ho chi, is teaching me a combination of gee koon doe and brazilian street fighting, ive even had my own octagon training ring designed.

MONICA:
 and i suppose you used a ring designer for that.

 yeah. monica, i want you there in the front row when i win. i want you close enough to smell the blood. what do you think?

MONICA:
 my parents will be so happy. 

PHOEBE:
   crazy underwear, always in a rut. crazy under-  oh no! what is he doing here? all right, just keep playing, just keep playing. youll get through this; youll be fine.  song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as   after the show. 

 

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: theyre are no rules.

MONICA:
 so you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?

ROSS:
 yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.

MONICA:
 whats fish hooking?

ROSS:
 huh, whats fish hooking...    thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. what is that taste?

JOEY:
 what? my hands are totally clean, i just gave the duck a bath. 

 so thanks for the warm welcome. its good to have you guys on my team, and i come to play. i hope you do too. now, lets go out there and get em! huh? and remember, there is no i in team.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 thank you! today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.

PHOEBE:
 yeesh, whatd you do about it?

CHANDLER:
 well, i didnt do anything. i didnt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.

MONICA:
 i gotta tell ya, i think its okay to be that guy.

JOEY:
 yeah, maybe its like y'know, that jock thing. y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.  

RACHEL:
 y'know i dont, i dont understand guys, i mean i-i would never congratulate monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em.

MONICA:
 okay, can we please go eat?

JOEY:
 yeah. what are we getting?

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 all right so, chandler, from now on, dont give your boss a chance to get you. y'know just ah, dont turn your back to him.

JOEY:
 yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. y'know? what you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  would smell bad?

CHANDLER:
  

PHOEBE:
 umm, hey rach, can i ask you something?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if i set ross up on a date?

RACHEL:
 oh, ah with who?

PHOEBE:
 umm, my friend, bonnie. she just always thought ross was really cute, and now that you two arent together, she asked if i could set it up, but if youre not cool with it...

RACHEL:
 oh-oh-oh, which one is bonnie again?

PHOEBE:
 you remember her from my birthday party two years ago. shes yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...

RACHEL:
 oh! 

PHOEBE:
 great! okay, good for you!   

 you are iron. you are steel! let me ask you something, how come when i call your computer support line, i have to wait an hour and a half?

 i told you, were adding new operators all the time. could we concentrate on my training?

 its just hard when i know i have e-mail i cant get! 

MONICA:
 

 monica! 

 all right, on the table. 

MONICA:
 hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. i-i dont want you to get hurt, cause i kinda like you.

 oh, believe me, i dont want to get hurt either. im being smart about this. see these guys? theyre the best trainers in the world, and hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.  a house painter.

MONICA:
 promise me youll be careful.

 i promise.

MONICA:
 hey, are we still on for tonight?

 yeah.

MONICA:
 okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...

 no! no boom-boom before big fight!

MONICA:
 how bout just a boom? 

RACHEL:
  pretzel from one of the kids from fame. ready to go to the movies?

PHOEBE:
 um-hmm. oh wait! this is bonnie. 

 hi!

RACHEL:
 this is bonnie?  bonnie?

 i can show you an id if you want?

RACHEL:
 oh no, im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time i-i saw you.

 oh yeah, well i just started wearing bras again.

RACHEL:
 oh, that must be it.

PHOEBE:
 

 thanks! you too.   

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, she was bald, shes not now.

RACHEL:
 how could you not tell me that she has hair?

PHOEBE:
 i dont know, i hardly ever say that about people.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 well im sorry, i thought you said it was okay.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i said what was okay when i thought she was some weird bald chick. i mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!

PHOEBE:
 well, maybe it wont work out. maybe ross wont like her personality.

RACHEL:
 why, does she have a bad personality?

PHOEBE:
 oh no, bonnies the best!  

 bing!  your computech proposal, a real homerun.   ooh. barely got ya that time, get over here. come on.   wham!   keep at it team. 

CHANDLER:
 

 with him? youre is favourite, youre his guy!

 we never get smacked.

CHANDLER:
 well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once.

 not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.

 im telling you, i need some smacks. i got a kid starting dartmouth in the fall.

  sucks. did you go to dartmouth bing?

CHANDLER:
 no sir.

 there you go.  

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 god ross, what is that?

ROSS:
 yeah, its the ultimate fighting combo. yeah, i saved thirty cents, plus i get to keep the cup. yay!!

 from new york city, new york! appearing in his ultimate fighting championship debut! hes known for his confrontational business style. ladies and gentlemen, introducing pete beck-errrr!!  

MONICA:
 i love you, pete!!!

 and his opponent, from hunnington beach, california! hes a 300 pound street fighter, tank abbottttttt!!!!  

MONICA:
 

 dont worry, hoshi taught me how to use an opponents strength and weight against him.

ROSS:
 well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble. 

ROSS:
 all right! you go get him! lets go!

 here we go gentlemen, here we go!    lets get it on!!  

 uh-oh.   commercial break 

MONICA:
 hey!  you how proud i am of you.

 it would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant you suck!

MONICA:
 i mean i-i thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. and now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.

 what, look back?

MONICA:
 well, youre not gonna get going are you?

 well let me ask you a question. am i the ultimate fighting champion?

MONICA:
 well, no. but...

 well im not gonna stop until im the ultimate fighting champion.

MONICA:
 that guy stood on your neck until you passed out!

 let me tell you a story. when i set out to create moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? no. there was moss 1, that burnt down my dads garage, there was moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in january, and 862 others that i learned from, just like i learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.

MONICA:
 you didnt know that already?

 look, im gonna get better. okay? i promise you.

MONICA:
 okay, just get a lot better. 

 oh, one other thing. hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.

MONICA:
 yeah. that-that was the problem.  

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 hey! how long until petes fight?

MONICA:
 oh, about five minutes. right now theyre interviewing his opponent. apparently he trains by going to iran and pulling the arms off thieves.

ROSS:
 hot dog?

MONICA:
 four, please.   thank you. 

PHOEBE:
 so ross, how umm, how did it go with bonnie?

ROSS:
 what? oh! i gotta tell you, i-i wasnt expecting to like her at all, i mean i actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.

PHOEBE:
 ohh, thats too bad!

ROSS:
 no, i-im saying i liked her.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.

ROSS:
 pheebs, i think shes great. okay? were going out again.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i hear you! are you capable of talking about any thing else?

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 ahh, the one next to my foot. sorry.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 okay, well be right in.  slap you again today?

CHANDLER:
 nine times! okay, i had to put on lotion! but, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.

JOEY:
    

CHANDLER:
 excuse me, doug? 

 

CHANDLER:
 no, i ah, i didnt do them.

 oh, you forgot?

CHANDLER:
 no, no i just ah, didnt do them. instead, i ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.

 well, i got tanked myself last night. pretty dicey drive home, tapanzi bridge never looked smaller.  guy! 

CHANDLER:
 doug!!

 hmm.

CHANDLER:
 im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.

 oh, is it the swearing? i mean is it the constant swearing? because i gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!

CHANDLER:
 no, no. it-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.

 oh?

CHANDLER:
 oh, and dont get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. its just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous.

 well, say no more. y'know it takes guts to bring this up. bing! youre okay.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

 ha!  ahhhhhhh!

CHANDLER:
 ahhhhh!  

PHOEBE:
 okay. would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?

RACHEL:
  its ross and that girl. 

PHOEBE:
 no! no! look at that!  of ants! theyre working as a team!

RACHEL:
 phoebe! 

PHOEBE:
  breaking up with her. uff, i hope he lets her down easy. lets go.

RACHEL:
 come on phoebe, look at that! they are not breaking up, look at them. okay thats, you know what that is? that is a, that is a second date, thats what that is! look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...

PHOEBE:
 oh no! that really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.

RACHEL:
 ohh!  he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.

PHOEBE:
 you said it was okay!

RACHEL:
 you said she was bald!!

PHOEBE:
 what?! what-what-what-what-what?!!

RACHEL:
 phoebe, we cant, we just cant just let it happen! okay, we have to do something! we have to break them up! okay? just go in there and like, shave her head! you owe me one bald girl!!

PHOEBE:
 okay, first of all, breathe. second of all, i dont get it. arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with ross?

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 well isnt he your friend? dont you want him to be happy?

RACHEL:
 yes.

PHOEBE:
 so?

RACHEL:
 i just y'know, i didnt expect him to be this happy so soon. ufff. ooo-ooh! 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh, we killed them all.

RACHEL:
 oh!    

 its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution. ah, im not supposed to move my spine.

MONICA:
 please tell me youre stopping now.

 im fine! id fight tonight, if theyd let me.   see this circle im marking off here? this is my zone of terror.

MONICA:
 you are insane! you-you gotta give this up!

 i cant until im the ultimate fighter. i will do it. im telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or superman. now, im not saying i could beat superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.

MONICA:
 sit down. all right? please, just listen to me. you are terrible at this! okay? you are the worst ultimate fighter ever! ever!! 

 y'know i have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised adams apple, but that really hurt.

MONICA:
 well then, y'know what? i care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. so if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it without me.

 well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be someone im not. ive got to do this.

MONICA:
 then ive gotta go. bye. 

 mon-monica?

MONICA:
 yes?

 could you leave a note? cause im on a lot of pain killers now, and i dont know if ill remember this tomorrow.   

 so, in conclusion, the lines all go up 

30.   stevens! way to go!  ya!  it without ya. 

CHANDLER:
 thank you, sir.

  accident.

 of course, you did. forgot something else too ya bastard!    are ya?

CHANDLER:
 no. no, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.

 everybody else got one, and you want one too. dont you?

CHANDLER:
 ye-ye-yeah, yes i do!

 now get on out of here, you!  closing credits  

 pete becker is circling the ring now. it looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. oh, bruiser is just...

CHANDLER:
 run! run you crazy, rich freak!

RACHEL:
 oh, i cant watch this. 

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 no-o-o!!

 uh-oh, bruiser has becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.

 oh! oh! 

PHOEBE:
 wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?

ROSS:
 well, this is ironic. of your last two boyfriends, richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now pete cant.

CHANDLER:
 

 all right, i was 15, it was my best friend, ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, i dont know, we were, we were making out.

CHANDLER:
 tell it again.  

RACHEL:
  but sex?

JOEY:
 yeah, sure. well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.

MONICA:
 joey, she was listing the countries shes done it in.

JOEY:
 well, i think we all learned something.

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
  1965.

PHOEBE:
 y'know what that means?

JOEY:
 that youre actually 50?

PHOEBE:
 no-no, thats not, thats not me phoebe, thats her pal phoebe. according to her high school yearbook, they were like b.f.f.   best friends forever.

 oh!

RACHEL:
 that is so cool.

PHOEBE:
 i know! so this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my dad is. so i looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. so maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?

 yeah! yeah, we can!

 

ROSS:
 thats too bad.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 so great! okay! tomorrow were gonna drive out to montauk.

JOEY:
 hey, bonnie had sex there!  opening credits  

MONICA:
  i ever gonna find a boyfriend again? i gonna die an old maid.

CHANDLER:
 youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, ill be your boyfriend. 

MONICA:
 yeah right.

CHANDLER:
 why is that so funny?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 ha-ha-ha. a little to hard. what am i not ah, boyfriend material?

MONICA:
 well, no. youre chandler. y'know, chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. but theoretically y'know, i mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. i show up at your door, and im like 

MONICA:
 well id probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 oh, hey! oh good, you brought food!

JOEY:

 hey!!

JOEY:
 woo-hoo! all right! yeah!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i am having the best karma this week. first, i find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.

ROSS:
 yeah? what about ah, that bike messenger you hit?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i wasnt talking about his karma.

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 hey-hey, check out the hat!  

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
  ive been looking for my father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?

 oh no, i-im sorry, i guess we lost track of everybody after high school.

PHOEBE:
  everything.

 ohh, well. y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.

PHOEBE:
 oh, what? what was it?

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 i just, i feel, i-i just...

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 i feel...  embrace in a more passionate kiss, only to be interrupted by joey and chandler coming 

CHANDLER:
  playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!  

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 well! good night. 

 gnight.  

JOEY:
    

PHOEBE:
 ow! my ass. okay. okay.   oh, shhh!  from the ceiling, to stop it from making a noise she grabs it and shhhs it. she goes into the kitchen and finds phoebe sr.s appointment book, to read it she opens the freezer. just as she starts to read, phoebe sr. jumps out from her bedroom with 

PHOEBE:
 no! no!! its me! its me! i-i didnt want to make any noise!

 then don't break in!!

PHOEBE:
 im sorry.

 what are you doing here?!

PHOEBE:
 i-i, came to fill your ice cube trays.

 what?!

PHOEBE:
 umm, okay, okay, look. i took this picture from your fridge. okay, because i know that this is my father. yeah, this is frank buffay and you are standing right there next to him. now, look i deserve to know where i came from. all right? so if you can help me find my father then you should! otherwise, youre just mean!  so, just tell me the truth!

 all right, the man in the picture is chuck magioni. 

PHOEBE:
 my father is chuck magioni?

 no, no, thats just chuck magioni, i-i sold him a house last year! and im very sorry, but i dont know where your father is, and thats the truth.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

 but umm, youre right. i think that a person should know where they come from. wh-which is why i ah, 

PHOEBE:
 heh?

 y'know i wanted to tell you yesterday, but i just, i kinda felt all floopy, and...    

JOEY:
 im telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!

ROSS:
 thats not true! her, she doesnt even know what she wants! rachels still mad about the whole thing.

CHANDLER:
 okay, then you gotta back away, all right? you dont need that kindve hurt. take it from a guy whos never had a long term relationship......

ROSS:
 i know, but ahhhhhh!! i really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!

 

CHANDLER:
 ahhhh! 

 you guys, the waters great. you should really go in.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 okey-dokey!

CHANDLER:
 there is not one hair on that head.

ROSS:
 hey, itll grow back, right? and she-shes really fun, and shes cool, and-and im finally moving on. y'know? i mean getting over rachel was so  sane again. and now if i go up there, and-and i kiss her, and, gooood i wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesnt work out, right? do i really wanna put myself through that again?

JOEY:
 so let me get this straight. if you go with bonnie tonight, youre doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 right, and you go with rachel, bonnies free tonight?  doors. he looks at the one on the right, then he looks at the one on his left, thinks 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 okay! okay! let me try it again, youre gonna wanna date this next guy, i swear!  

 

PHOEBE:
 ehh?  

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
  

JOEY:

JOEY:
  and rachel convinced her to save her head. and then ross and rachel kiss, and now ross has to choose between rachel and the bald girl and i dont know what happened there either...  

JOEY:
 y'know what, hold on, let me go get chandler.   in front of the two doors of rachels and bonnies rooms, trying to decide which

RACHEL:
 well, cant you tell her that you are not in the mood?

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 whoa-oh, okay! yeah, why am i telling you that?

RACHEL:
 i dont know. 

ROSS:
 yeah, yeah. 

RACHEL:
 oh, making it worse!

ROSS:
 okay. opening credits  

 so i guess youd like to know how it all happened. 

PHOEBE:
 i-i mean i, well i think i can figure it out. i guess y'know i was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!

 noo! no! it wasnt like that i... remember how i told you how lily, frank, and i we were, we were close. well, we were, we were very close.

PHOEBE:
 how close?

 well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.

PHOEBE:
 i dont even know how that would work!

 well, we were...

PHOEBE:
 

 well, any how, some how i got pregnant, and, and i was scared. i was stupid and sellfish, and i was 18 years old. i mean, you remember what its like to be eighteen years old?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. lets see, my had mom killed herself, and my dad had run off, and i was living in a gremlin with a guy named cindy who talked to his hand.

 well, im so sorry. i thought i was leaving you with the best parents in the world, i didnt even hear about your mom and dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. i dont know, youre here, and i would, i would really, i would like to get to know you.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, well, everybody does! im a really cool person. and y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didnt even try! y'know what, you walked out on me, and im just, im gonna do the same thing to you.

PHOEBE:
 i dont ever want to see you again!  

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 oh.  

ROSS:
 its over.

RACHEL:
 oh, was it awful?

ROSS:
 well, it was loong. i didnt even realise how late it was, until i noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head.   anyway, she didnt want to stay. i called a cab; she just left. 

RACHEL:
 i wrote you a letter.

ROSS:
 ohh! thank you! i like mail.  

RACHEL:
  thinking about. some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, i just need to know how you feel about this stuff.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 well, ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
   what happened to you? why didnt you come up?

ROSS:
 done!

RACHEL:
 you just finished?

ROSS:
 well, i wanted to be thorough. i mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! and so i wanted to read every word carefully, twice!

RACHEL:
 so umm, does it?

ROSS:
 im sorry.

RACHEL:
 does it?

ROSS:
 does it? does it? yeah, i wanted to give that whole does it? part just another glance.

RACHEL:
 what are you talking about, ross, you just said that you read it twice! look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even think about it...

ROSS:
  to think about it, in fact, ive decided, ive decided that, that it.......does.  

RACHEL:
 are you sure?

ROSS:
 oh, sure! im sure.

RACHEL:
 i know.   

CHANDLER:
 all right, theres a nuclear holocaust, im the last man on earth. would you go out with me?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
  guys! take a look at this!  this baby out, dug me a hole!

CHANDLER:
 excellent hole, joe. 

JOEY:
 oh no! no!! my hole!!

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 jellyfish sting! oh, it hurts! it hurts!! it hurts!!

CHANDLER:
 well, can we help?! you want us to take you back to the house?!

MONICA:
 its like two miles!

JOEY:
 yeah, and im a little tired from digging the hole.

MONICA:
 oh damn the jellyfish. damn all the jellyfish!

CHANDLER:
 weve got to do something!

JOEY:
 well, theres really only one thing you can do.

MONICA:
 what?! what is it?!

JOEY:
 youre gonna have to pee on it.

MONICA:
 what?!! gross!!

JOEY:
 dont blame me, i saw it on the discovery channel.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what, hes right. theres something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.

MONICA:
 well forget it! it doesnt hurt that 

JOEY:
 if you want some privacy you can use my hole. 

PHOEBE:
 well, im ready to get the hell out of here!   oh. are you? are you?!!  thats so great!! ooh, not for bonnie.  ohh. 

ROSS:
 hey!

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 nothing. im gonna take a shower.

CHANDLER:
 me too!!

JOEY:
 me too.

PHOEBE:
 okay, im gonna put this 

RACHEL:
 ooh, i have to go pack. 

ROSS:
 it does. it really and truly does.  

ROSS:
  commercial break 

ROSS:
 she wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. i mean she goes on for five pages about, about how i was unfaithful to her!  

CHANDLER:
 oh my god! if you say that one more time, im gonna break up with you!

ROSS:
 fine! fine! but this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,   full responsibility! ...i can begin to trust you again. does that seem like something you can do. 

JOEY:
 no?

CHANDLER:
 look, ross, you have what you want, youre back with rachel. if you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.

ROSS:
  ill let it go. but you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.

JOEY:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 what? whats wrong?

PHOEBE:
 i just, i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother.

RACHEL:
 you mean the mom you met in montauk. she was a cat?!

PHOEBE:
 no, no-no, she was a human lady. this is the spirit of my mom lily, the one who killed herself.

ROSS:
 are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your grandmas glycoma medicine again?

PHOEBE:
 no dr. skeptismo! im sure. first of all, okay, theres the feeling.  guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  mothers favourite fish is orange roughy...   cats....like....fish!   hi, mommy.  havent seen this smile in 17 years!

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 umm, when were you gonna tell me that youre going out with chip matthews?

MONICA:
 now? is it okay if i go out with chip matthews?

RACHEL:
 nooo! its not okay! i cant believe you would want to after what he did to me!

MONICA:
 what, that little thing at the prom?

RACHEL:
 monica! i couldnt find him for two hours! he was having sex with amy welch!

MONICA:
 come on, that was back in high school! how could that still bother you?

RACHEL:
 i mean why, of all people would you want to go out with chip?!

MONICA:
 look, you and i went to different high schools...

RACHEL:
 okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.

MONICA:
 you went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 it was a project for one of the home ec classes.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 back then, i thought that i would never, ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. i-i owe her this. i never let her eat.

RACHEL:
 oh, you go out with him. 

MONICA:
 oh, really?!

RACHEL:
 yeah. just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?

MONICA:
 ill try. 

ROSS:
 so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?

JOEY:
 well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, i dont think any of them are gonna work out.

CHANDLER:
 yes, joey has a very careful screening process. apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.

PHOEBE:
  trying to get away! just like when she was alive.

ROSS:
 so pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?

PHOEBE:
 well, im not sure. i mean, i guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that theres y'know, a new mom. y'know, i think shes worried that y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced.  well, thats not gonna happen is it? noo.  the other room.

MONICA:
 why cant you use the phone in here?

PHOEBE:
 well, im returning a call from a certain mom at the b-e-a-c-h. i just spelled the wrong word. 

ROSS:
 so, guys, am i crazy, or does phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?

MONICA:
 ross, dont start.

ROSS:
 come on, you-you cant tell me you actually believe that-that theres a woman inside that cat!

RACHEL:
 i believe it.

ROSS:
 no you dont. 

RACHEL:
 yes, i do.

ROSS:
 no you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.

RACHEL:
 oh sure i am, because you always have to be right.

ROSS:
 i do not always have to beokay, okay. 

RACHEL:
 jurassic park could happen.   

 wow! thats ah, thats pretty nice!

JOEY:
 pretty nice?

CHANDLER:
 youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.

 we dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? weve got a canoe.  

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i, i really dont think we need a canoe.

 you gotta take the canoe!

CHANDLER:
 all right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!

 were not throwing it away! i built that canoe!  

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
  tacked up on a telephone pole! 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

MONICA:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 i hate when ross is right!

MONICA:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 oh yeah?  ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

 thats a good call. right.

ROSS:
 no! no! lookhey, enough is enough! look, i am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. this is a cat! okay, julio the cat! not mom! cat!

PHOEBE:
  how many parents have you lost?

ROSS:
 none.

PHOEBE:
 okay, then you dont know what it feels like when one of them comes back. do you? i believe this is my mother. even if im wrong, who cares? just be a friend. okay? be supportive.

ROSS:
 im sorry.

PHOEBE:
 okay.

ROSS:
 i dont know what to say.

RACHEL:
 you could.... say youre sorry to her mom.

PHOEBE:
 i think she would like that.

ROSS:
  buffay. sorry, about what i said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. when clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friends mother.

PHOEBE:
 thank you. we both forgive you.

RACHEL:
 so honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, okay, listen, umm, mom, i hope you know you still mean a lot to me. and youre welcome to come back anytime.

CHANDLER:
 pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate it. 

PHOEBE:
 come on, mom, ill take you home.

RACHEL:
 ill go with you.

MONICA:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 wow! really?! we get all this rusty crap for free?!

JOEY:
 uh-huh. this and a bunch of bubble wrap. and, some of it is not even popped!   

CHANDLER:
 could we be more white trash? opening credits 

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh! good thing chandlers not here, he always wins at this game.

MONICA:
 i just told my mom id cater a party for her.

PHOEBE:
 how come?

MONICA:
 because i need the money, and i thought that itd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.

ROSS:
 come on, i think this is a good thing. i dont think mom wouldve hired you if she didnt think you were good at what you do.

MONICA:
 you dont have to stick up for her. she cant here you.  

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 just pickle.

CHANDLER:
 hey uh, rach, funny story. i ah, bumped into joanna on the street yesterday.

RACHEL:
 my boss, joanna? wow, that mustve been awkward.

CHANDLER:
 well, no, actually she uh, asked me if i wanted to get a drink.

RACHEL:
  did you?

CHANDLER:
 

  rachel. 

CHANDLER:
 well, not at first.

RACHEL:
 what is she doing here? 

RACHEL:
 i dont understand! last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud.

CHANDLER:
 well, i think i judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level. 

RACHEL:
 well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now!

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on! its not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i mean usually im pretty much just in there by myself.  

RACHEL:
 chandler!!  it.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i promise, ill end it.

RACHEL:
 thank you.

CHANDLER:
 i hope you know what im giving up for ya, because shes not just the boss in your office, if you know what i mean.

JOEY:
 yeah-eh-eah!  he meant.  

 

MONICA:
 doing great, the quiches are coming along.

 whats this? blue nail polish?

MONICA:
 yeah, i thought it was cute.

 ahh, thats what your grandmothers hands looked like when we found her.

MONICA:
 let me ask you a question.

 hmm.

MONICA:
 why did you hire me?

 oh, well richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, i assume you werent sleeping with anybody there. though, at least that would be something. 

MONICA:
  she thinks im good.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i didnt hear that.

MONICA:
 oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasnt so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks im good.

PHOEBE:
 wow! and hey, its cool if youre a lesbian!    

  are you the decision maker of the house?

JOEY:
 uhhhh. 

 do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? 

JOEY:
 no! no. but ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.

 actually, im not buying. im selling. let me ask you one question. do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though youre not really sure what theyre talking about?  

ROSS:
 im telling you its totally unconstituional.

 oh yeah, i totally agree.  

MONICA:
 i think he deserves a nobel prize.  

 nooo!!  

CHANDLER:
 it was like the algonquin kids table.   

  you havent said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?

JOEY:
 yeah-well-yeah! yeah-oh-yeah. come on in. 

PHOEBE:
 thats weird.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 your nails.

MONICA:
 oh, i know, i never wear fake ones. i just did it so my mom wouldnt give me grief about me biting them.

PHOEBE:
 oh, no, i meant that its weird that you only have nine now.

MONICA:
  put 

PHOEBE:
 okay, dont panic. im gonna go to the store, im gonna get you another set of nails, no ones gonna know, and youre gonna look great.  theyre gonna eatthats the problem.

 

MONICA:
 okay ah, please dont freak out. umm, but ah, theres a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and theres no way to know which one.

PHOEBE:
 and! whoever finds it wins the prize!

 

MONICA:
 then why are you laughing?

 its nothing, its just that now your father owes me five dollars.

MONICA:
 what? you bet id lose a nail?

 oh no, dont be silly. i just bet id need these. 

MONICA:
 frozen lasagnas?

 um-hmm.

MONICA:
 you bet that id screw up?! so all that stuff about hiring me because i was good was

 no-no-no, that was all true. this was just in case you pulled a monica.

MONICA:
 you promised dr. weinburg, youd never use that phrase.

 oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, youve never been able to laugh at yourself.

MONICA:
  in me! oh, thats hilarious! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

PHOEBE:
 i dont get it.

 no, i have faith

MONICA:
  

 ding!

PHOEBE:
 op, the ruined quiches are ready.  

CHANDLER:
 it just doesntfeel like were breaking up.

 no, we are. im sad.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

  until tomorrow? 

CHANDLER:
 thanks.

 no, no, that was my boss. i have to go.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

 what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 im getting dressed.

 why?

CHANDLER:
 when i walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.

 wait. i wanna show you something.

CHANDLER:
 what is it?

 just a little gag gift somebody gave me.   put your hands together.

CHANDLER:
 ah-ha, youre not the boss of me.  yeah, you are! 

  

CHANDLER:
 you are, youre gonna leave me like this?

 knowing youre here, waiting for me i think its kinda exciting.

CHANDLER:
 okay. but if you dont come back soon,   theres pretty much nothing i can do about it!  

 

 hi! i brought you back a macaroon!

 oh great! ill keep it in my butt with your nose.  

RACHEL:
 thats weird, she locked the door.

 yknow why? shes got the christmas bonus list in there. i saw her working on it this morning.

RACHEL:
 okay, swear you wont tell, but when mark left he gave me a key to joannas office. do you wanna see the list?

 yeah!  

CHANDLER:
 hi!   commercial break  through the lingerie catalogue by turning the pages with his teeth. the phone rings and 

CHANDLER:
 hello, joanna s office.

  while longer.

CHANDLER:
 how little?!

 a couple of hours, i feel awful.

CHANDLER:
 look, this isnt funny! you get back here right now!

 i cant!!

CHANDLER:
 why not?!

 im in my bosss car!

CHANDLER:
 what?!

 uh-oh, tunnel.   

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
  for a moment? 

CHANDLER:
 okay, heres the situation. the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? and on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.

RACHEL:
 you promised you would break up with her!

CHANDLER:
 i did break up with her! she just took it really, really well!

RACHEL:
 and the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!

CHANDLER:
 it did enter my mind! but then something happened that made it, shoot right out.

RACHEL:
 y'know what chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no-no-no-no!! i cant get myself right out of them! you must have me confused with the amazing chandler!! come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and im cold, and  

RACHEL:
 oh, chandler!! all right, this is it!  never see joanna again!

CHANDLER:
 never!

RACHEL:
 you never come into this office again!

CHANDLER:
 fine!

RACHEL:
 you give me back my walkman!

CHANDLER:
 inever borrowed your walkman.

RACHEL:
 well, then i lost it. you buy me one!

CHANDLER:
 you got it! here we go! come on! this is great!   ahhh! 

RACHEL:
 does it hurt?

CHANDLER:
 no, i just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. 

RACHEL:
 wait a minute! what are you gonna tell joanna?

CHANDLER:
 about what?

RACHEL:
 when she sees that youre gone, shes gonna know that i let you out, and that i was in here, and im gonna get fired!

CHANDLER:
 ill make something up! im good at lying, i actually did borrow your walkman!

RACHEL:
 no, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna know that i have a key to her office, ive got to get you locked up back the way you were! 

CHANDLER:
 oh-ho-ho, i dont think so!  get to the chair, chandler drops his pants and knocks the chair away. rachel then backs 

CHANDLER:
 well, this is much better. 

 so, heres somebody interesting, joey. what do you know about van gogh?

JOEY:
 he cut off his ear.

 and?

JOEY:
 im out.

 he painted that.  

JOEY:
 wow! thats pretty nice. i thought he cut off his ear cause he sucked. what else you got in there?

 lets see, ahhh where does the pope live?

JOEY:
 in the woods. no wait-wait, thats the joke answer.

 actually its, vatican city. now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?

JOEY:
 spocks birth control.

   

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hi.

PHOEBE:
 this used to be your room?  mustve been in really good shape as a kid.

MONICA:
 ohh, im such an idiot. i cant believe i actually thought she could change.

PHOEBE:
 well, who cares what your mom thinks? so you pulled a monica.

MONICA:
 oh good, im glad thats catching on.

PHOEBE:
 no but, why does that have to be a bad thing. just change what it means. y'know? go down there and prove your mother wrong. finish the job you were hired to do, and well call that pulling a monica.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 okay, umm, if a kid gets straight as, his parents would say, "yeah, he pulled a monica." y'know? or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "yeah i know, he pulled a monica." or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "yeah, that ones outta here." though some things dont change.

MONICA:
  not gonna serve the lasagna. im gonna serve something i make.  

PHOEBE:
 wow! my breasts are really strong.    

RACHEL:
 chandler! chandler, please, i have to get you locked up back the way you were, i am sooo gonna lose my job, shes very private about her office. now i know why.

CHANDLER:
 hey, look, youre in trouble either way! okay? if she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, shes gonna know you were in here. so you might as well just let me go.

RACHEL:
 what if i clean your bathroom for a month?

CHANDLER:
 it still wouldnt be clean.   all i want is my freedom.

RACHEL:
 foot rubs for a month!

CHANDLER:
 freedom!

RACHEL:
 ill take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!

CHANDLER:
 freedom! i want my freedom! why wont you here me?! 

RACHEL:
 sophie sit!! 

RACHEL:
 no! god, would you just calm down!  

CHANDLER:
 im gonna say this for the last time. would you please just    

JOEY:
 wow! theres a lot i didnt know about vomit.    

 so, what do you say, joey? you get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!

JOEY:
 twelve hundred dollars? you think i have $1200? im home in the middle of the day, and i got patio furniture in my living room. i guess theres a few things you dont get from book learnin.

 well ah, what can you swing?

JOEY:
 how about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?

 you dont have, anything?

JOEY:
 you wanna see what i got?  okay? ive got a baby tootsie roll, a movie stub, keys, a kleenex, a rock, and an army man. hey!

 okay, i-i get the picture. uh, thanks, for your time. 

JOEY:
 and a 50.  chandlers pants.

 for 50 bucks, you can get one book! what will it be? a? b? c?

JOEY:
 oh, i-i think im gonna stick with the v, i wanna see how this bad boy turns out. 

RACHEL:
 i ah, will buy and wrap all of your christmas gifts.

CHANDLER:
 no!

RACHEL:
 i ah oh! ill squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!

CHANDLER:
 with extra pulp?

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 no!

RACHEL:
 doh!! 

CHANDLER:
 you dont have it.

RACHEL:
 i have so got it. theres gonna be rumours about this, theres no way to stop it. sophie knows, monica and phoebe know.

CHANDLER:
 how do monica and phoebe know?

RACHEL:
 oh, i called them. and when they ask me what i saw, i can be very generous 

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 i can make you a legend. i can make you this generations milton berle.

CHANDLER:
 and milton berle has a

RACHEL:
 ohh, not compared to you.  

MONICA:
 well?

PHOEBE:
 theyre not even touching the lasagna!

MONICA:
 really?!

PHOEBE:
 oh, they love your casserole.

MONICA:
 yes!!

PHOEBE:
 its hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.

 

MONICA:
 and you?

 i thought it was quite tasty.

MONICA:
 so if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. which would make you

 

MONICA:
 well, i was going for wrong, but we can use your word.

 yes, well i was wrong, and i have to say you really impressed me today.

MONICA:
 wow!

PHOEBE:
 umm, you might even say that she pulled a monica.    

 and the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer. 

MONICA:
 that really means a lot. oh, and mom, dont bite your nails. 

CHANDLER:
 

 hey!

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 wh-whats going on?

PHOEBE:
 oh.   

JOEY:
 no he doesnt!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 so did you break up with joanna?

CHANDLER:
 i think so.

JOEY:
 well, its good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that vesuvius.

ROSS:
 the volcano?

JOEY:
 yeah. and speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.

RACHEL:
 what?!

JOEY:
 oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.

MONICA:
 why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?

JOEY:
 well, we can talk about something else. what do you want to talk about? vivisection? the vasdeferens? the vietnam war?

MONICA:
 oh! did anybody see that-that documentary on the korean war? 

 oh, yeah. yeah.

PHOEBE:
 oh god, korea is such a beautiful country.

ROSS:
 with such a sad history.

CHANDLER:
 could there be more kims?   closing credits 

 

RACHEL:
 its me! good morning!

 rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?

RACHEL:
 yeah, sure. umm, they didnt have poppy seed bagels, so i   oh my word!

 i seem to have had a slight office mishap. could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah! yeah!  

 you tell your friend chandler that were definately broken up this time.

PHOEBE:
 hey! new wallet, huh?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, it was time. the old condom ring in the leather just doesnt say cool anymore.

MONICA:
 rachel!

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 you just put an empty carton back in the fridge!

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, i know, but the garbage was full.

MONICA:
 have you ever taken out the trash? 

RACHEL:
 well, i thought you liked doing it.  

MONICA:
 third door on the left.

RACHEL:
 right! 

RACHEL:
 oh! hey, mr. treeger.

: hey.  then tries to throw the pizza box in, but since its so big she jams it into the opening and it prevents the door from closing. she then turns around too see mr. treeger 

: what are you doing?

RACHEL:
 ummm. oh! im sorry.  its a little old but

: no! youre clogging up the chute that i spent a half-hour unclogging!

RACHEL:
 im sorry. i didnti dont come in here a lot.

: oh yeah, of course you dont!

RACHEL:
 no.

: cause youre a little princess! "daddy, buy me a pizza. daddy, buy me a candy factory. daddy, make the cast of cats sing happy birthday to me"

RACHEL:
 i didnt i never said that.

: you think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? well, why dont think of someone else for a change?

RACHEL:
   

MONICA:
 god! if youre gonna cry about it!   opening credits  

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa, treeger made you cry?

RACHEL:
 yes! and he said really mean things that were only partly true. 

JOEY:
 im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.

MONICA:
 joey, please dont do that. i think its best that we just forget about it.

RACHEL:
 thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.

JOEY:
 all right thats it, school is in session!  

MONICA:
  card?

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, gym member. i try to go four times a week, but ive missed the last 1200 times.

ROSS:
 so why dont you quit?

CHANDLER:
 you dont think ive tried? you think i like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? no, they make you go all the way down there! then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! then they bring out maria.

ROSS:
 who is maria?

CHANDLER:
 oh maria. you cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.

ROSS:
 you need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?

CHANDLER:
 no!

ROSS:
 so youre strong enough to face her on your own?

CHANDLER:
 oh no, youll have to come. 

: tribbiani! hold on, ill get the plunger.

JOEY:
 hey! you hold on pal! now you made my friend, rachel, cry. so now, youre gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.

: and tell him what?

JOEY:
 have you heard about a little something called, not making girls cry.

: yeah. well maybe you have heard about the rent stabilization act of 1968!

JOEY:
 i have actually not heard of that.

: yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. ive been a nice guy up until now, but uh, i dont need this grief. im gonna call the landlord and tell him that monica is illegally subletting here grandmothers apartment. your friends are outta here pal.

JOEY:
 why dont you tell me something i dont know!    

PHOEBE:
 oh please, somebody tell me i dont have to go to work today!

MONICA:
 whats the matter?

PHOEBE:
 oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time i see him i just want to do things to him that im not allowed to charge for.

MONICA:
 so do them for free.

PHOEBE:
 oh no, it is forbidden! no-no, mrs. potter fires people for fooling around with clients. and its against my oath as a masseuse.

ROSS:
 they make you take an oath?

PHOEBE:
 no, i made myself take an oath. yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. yeah, that ones actually from the boy scouts, but it just makes good sense.

CHANDLER:
 why dont you just give him to somebody else?

PHOEBE:
 no, i can handle it. no, im a professional. 

RACHEL:
 oh pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?

MONICA:
 wow! and you got a petticure. your feet are all dressed up.

CHANDLER:
 because thats the only part of you he can see when hes on the table!

MONICA:
 youre gonna do some feet flirtin!

PHOEBE:
 i dont what your talking about.  

ROSS:
 then how do you explain the toe ring?!

PHOEBE:
 because its arabian princess day at work! okay?! leave me alone! 

RACHEL:
 oh! my hero! what happened?

JOEY:
 well uh, i went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that hed better come up here and apologize. ill see you later. 

MONICA:
 what a minute, what did he say?

JOEY:
 he said that he wasnt gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what hes gonna do is have you evictedill see you later.

RACHEL:
 what?! you got us evicted!!

MONICA:
 i told you not to go down there!

JOEY:
 well he made rachel cry!

MONICA:
 rachel always cries!

RACHEL:
 thats not true! 

MONICA:
 now joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. i mean you suck like youve never sucked before!

JOEY:
 all right! ill try! but if i cant, you can stay with chandler and i until you get settled.

RACHEL:
 go!!

JOEY:
 all right, all right, all right.   i mean ill have to check with him first, but ill think hell be cool with it.  

ROSS:
 whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.

CHANDLER:
 yes. 

ROSS:
 one more time, "hey, dont you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"

CHANDLER:
 no! i want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!

ROSS:
 good! thats good!

CHANDLER:
 okay.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

ROSS:

 hi, im maria.   

 

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 you mean theokay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.

PHOEBE:

 oh, a 16-hour sit-in for greenpeace.

PHOEBE:
 oh. 

 ow! did you just bite me?

PHOEBE:

: what?

JOEY:

: you want me to kick you guys out instead?

JOEY:
 no you cant do that, where would the chick and the duck live?

: you have pets!

JOEY:
 noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. im the chick and chandler is the duck.

: huh, i wouldve thought it was the other way around.

JOEY:

: really? youll do anything?

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah, absolutely.

: yeah, ive got something you can do.

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 well, why doesnt he practice with a girl?

JOEY:
 well, hes too shy, he doesnt thing hes good enough to dance with girls yet.

RACHEL:
 yeah, right, he almost danced me right down thatgarbage chute. 

MONICA:
 oh, would you let it go already?! youre fine! 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hey! so, did you quit?

CHANDLER:
 no, i almost did, couldnt leave ross there without a spotter!

MONICA:
 wait, now so you joined the gym? 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh, umm, i was just yknow working out and umm oh, thats it.

CHANDLER:
 were doomed. okay, theyre gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. what are we gonna do?

MONICA:
 well, you could actually go to the gym. 

ROSS:
 or! or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.

CHANDLER:
 youre a genius!

JOEY:
 aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!

CHANDLER:
 now, theres two reasons.

PHOEBE:
 

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 ohh, you guys, remember that cute client i told you about? i bit him.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 no, i know! i-im sorry, but the moment i touch him, i just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.

MONICA:
 well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.

JOEY:

: ahhhh! im sorry!

JOEY:

: ahh, forget it! ill never be any good at this, my mom was right, im just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

 phoebe, we have rules here, this isnt that kind of place.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, oh and i know, but this isnt what it looks like, cause rick is my ahh, husband.

 oh really? well, then youd better tell his other wife, cause she called three times asking where he is.

PHOEBE:
 yes, i will tell her.  

MONICA:
 so you didnt leave the bank?

ROSS:
 no! and somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 to pay for the gym. 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey! so i had a great day, rick and i really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.

: hey duck, is chick here?

CHANDLER:
 yeah bunny-rabbit.

JOEY:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 oh my god! that's why i got up too!

CHANDLER:
 so ah, joey tells me you two met in acting class.

 yeah, they teamed us up as partners. joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 it's fun, god i love how sexy i am. 

JOEY:
 oh, kath, we should get going. we're going to by hamsters.

 ooh, that's great, i love those little guys.

 no, no, it's not like that. i, i work for a medical researcher.

RACHEL:
 well, have fun!

 okay.

PHOEBE:
 well, i think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.

MONICA:
 y'know what, i like kathy.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.

RACHEL:
 yeah, she's...

CHANDLER:
 she's smart and funny, y'know? we were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what? 

RACHEL:
 you love her.

CHANDLER:
 no, i don't.

PHOEBE:
 yes, you do. chandler loves kathy.

ROSS:
 come on, pheebs lay off him.

CHANDLER:
 thank you, ross.

ROSS:
 yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.

CHANDLER:
 all right.

 ohh!

CHANDLER:
 all right.

MONICA:
   ooh, umm, oh kathy! kathy, i love you! oh!   

PHOEBE:
 so, i need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.

MONICA:
 oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. oh, yeah, i could write about the time my hair did that "woo-hoo" thing.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 rachel's not here.

ROSS:
 oh.

MONICA:
 how's it going with her?

ROSS:
 great, actually. i'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. yeah, i mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, i'm thinking amanda and i break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.

RACHEL:
  friends, and that's ross.

MONICA:
 hi, josh.

PHOEBE:
 hi.

 dudes.

MONICA:
 so, did you play in college?  

 oh, i still do. next year, i hope to make varsity though.

RACHEL:
 ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in high school? oh no wait, that's right. you just organized their game schedules on your commodore 64.

 well, it's getting late, i've got to get to the game, so i'm gonna... head.

RACHEL:
 okay.   i'll miss you.

 dope! 

PHOEBE:
 wow, cute one!

MONICA:
 very!

RACHEL:
 i know, isn't he great? it's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? there's nothing boring about him, and ah, i bet he's never set foot in a museum.

ROSS:
 well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.

RACHEL:
 y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?

ROSS:
 oh! 

RACHEL:
 what was that?

ROSS:
 monica knows.

MONICA:
 it's this dumb thing that ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. it's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. i remember i cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that i realized that i was actually cooler than my older brother.

ROSS:
 well, i'm gonna go get ready,  tonight, so ah, i'll just_ head.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i should go to, `cause i'm playing in one hour. hey,   you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. ooh,   my sticky shoes--eww! eww! i lost my sexy phlegm! 

 

ROSS:
 hi!

 hi ben!

ROSS:
 wow! you-you look great!

 thanks!

ROSS:
 

 i am so glad that you could come over tonight.

ROSS:
 oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.

 okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.

ROSS:
 what?

 i appreciate this soo much, i've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.

ROSS:
 i-i-i...

  but i'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? oh uh, thanks for this, i hope i can do the same for you sometime. 

ROSS:
 who wants to make some long distance calls? 

CHANDLER:
 kathy! kathy! hi!! kathy! kathy!  running, chandler starts chasing her as the theme to the mod squad starts to play. first, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a  kathy!   fetch! fetch it!   kathy! kathy! kathy!  get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. he gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of  kathy! 

 hey, chandler! what are you doing here?

CHANDLER:
 oh, i just wanted to say, "hey!"

 hey!

CHANDLER:
 okay.  commercial break 

MONICA:
 oh come on! you're making it sound worse than it actually was.

ROSS:
 her date tipped me ten dollars.   

ROSS:
 pheebs, what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 okay, i wanna be sexy again so i'm trying to catch a cold. it should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.

MONICA:
 phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 what?!

ROSS:
 are you serious?

PHOEBE:
 well, how-how-how is that possible? you barely know her!

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. i can't--i just, i can't get her out of my head. y'know? i mean, i'm a very bad person. i'm a very, very bad person. i'm a horrible person.   no you're not chandler! we still love you chandler!

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 you mean you stole it!  when you do that! 

JOEY:
 hey.

 

CHANDLER:
 really?!

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah, i told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.

CHANDLER:
   

CHANDLER:
 99...100! ready or not, here i come!   all right, let's go over the concept one more time.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey guys.  kathy tonight?

CHANDLER:
 ohh, umm, y'know what, i already ate.

JOEY:
 it's 4:30.

CHANDLER:
 y'know i had a big meal on monday, y'know. so that's just gonna get me straight through the week.

JOEY:
 okay, i see what's going on here.

CHANDLER:
 you-you do?

JOEY:
 yeah! you don't like kathy.

CHANDLER:
 you got me.

JOEY:
 yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. look, i made an effort to like janice, now i think it's your turn to make an effort to like kathy by going out to dinner with us. right?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. right.

JOEY:
 good, and hey! my treat.  that's only because you're not eating anything, right?

CHANDLER:
 okay.  

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh. 

 so i'll see you at the party? beer's beer man, 24, 7!!

RACHEL:
 yeah!  marry that guy. 

MONICA:
 what?

RACHEL:
 i think he's stealing from me.

MONICA:
 why?

RACHEL:
 because he's stealing from me!

PHOEBE:
  looks so yummy in your leather jacket.

RACHEL:
 ughh! 

PHOEBE:
  there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. 

MONICA:
 thank you so much phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 what are you doing with those?!

PHOEBE:
 but, i need your germs! i want my cold back! i miss my sexy voice.

MONICA:
 sorry, phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 it's okay. how's the soup?

MONICA:
 umm.  

MONICA:
 ohhhh!! gross!! 

 ohh, god, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!

JOEY:
 is she great or what?

 

CHANDLER:
 ohh, she's-she's not really my type.

 not your type?! she's gorgeous!

CHANDLER:
 y'know what i think it is? it's the fishnet stockings. y'know? whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.

 okay. understanding a little more why you're single. ohh! y'know, i have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. and then we could double date!

CHANDLER:
 uhh, no-no thanks.

 okay, i've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.

CHANDLER:
 listen, i-i'm gonna grab a beer. 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. i thought we had a deal.

CHANDLER:
 hey, look, what do you want from me?

JOEY:
 i want you to like her! but if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.

CHANDLER:
 i am pretending.

JOEY:
 well then, do it better!

CHANDLER:
 okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her?  about her. that i haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her. that i'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!

JOEY:
 well, that's pretty good. but you might wanna tone it down a little. 

ROSS:
  of the things i love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive.  i guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?

MONICA:
 no, sorry.

RACHEL:
 well where's amanda?

MONICA:
 hey rach, could you get me some cough drops?

RACHEL:
 i mean y'know, i'm thinking. you could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.

MONICA:
 ross, cough drops, please?

ROSS:
 at least i know she's not going out with me to get into r rated movies.

RACHEL:
 why don't you just marry her? oh no, wait a minute you can't, i'm sorry i forgot, she's not a lesbian.

ROSS:
 you see amanda and i have a very special...

MONICA:
  baby sitter! you have a 12-year-old girl's job!

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 and what are you laughing at, miss `my-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!' 

RACHEL:
 hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! at least he bought me something with it! 

MONICA:
 that's mine!! now, would you both please start acting like adults? and get me my cough drops!

ROSS:
 fine.

RACHEL:
 sorry.

ROSS:
 here.  in my relationship.

RACHEL:
 y'know...   

PHOEBE:
  platting goats are platting, leaving little treats.  without my sexy voice?

 i like it. 

PHOEBE:
 gunther, kiss me.

 what?   

JOEY:
   hey!  gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?  

CHANDLER:
 can i sleep on your couch?  closing credits 

PHOEBE:
  you my babies. 

 rachel?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

 i don't know if you heard about what happened between me and phoebe the other day_

RACHEL:
 no!

 well, we kissed. i-i-i didn't initiate the kiss, but-but i also didn't stop it, and i've been feeling guilty.

RACHEL:
 

 so umm, are we cool?

RACHEL:
 

 so, thank you for the delicious dinner.  

ROSS:
 you're welcome for a delicious dinner.   

PHOEBE:
 hey what are you guys looking at?  

CHANDLER:
 ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.  

PHOEBE:
 yeah, come to papa.   

ROSS:
 i know!  

MONICA:
 probably the only time i'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?  

CHANDLER:
 where did you, when did you, how did you...   how did you get a girl like that?  

RACHEL:
 yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?  

ROSS:
 actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.  

CHANDLER:
 okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.  

ROSS:
 i've seen her at work, but i always figured, ah-huh? but, uh, i made her dinner. we had a great time. and we're going out again tomorrow.  

RACHEL:
 well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.  

ROSS:
 fine by me; hope she wins.   opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 hi. you guys have any wrapping paper?  

PHOEBE:
 oo! is it for my birthday present?  

CHANDLER:
 phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.  

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?  

CHANDLER:
 well, i have a call in about that.  

PHOEBE:
 'kay.  

CHANDLER:
 actually, this is for kathy's birthday. it's an early edition of her favorite book.  

RACHEL:
 oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!  

CHANDLER:
 okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.  

RACHEL:
 huh. well, then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that?  

CHANDLER:
 oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.  

RACHEL:
 oh, honey, that's so sweet.  

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and what a great way to say, "i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"  

CHANDLER:
 it doesn't say that. does it?  

ROSS:
 how do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange?  

CHANDLER:
 okay, all right, i'll just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great.  

PHOEBE:
 it's gotta be better than that book. oo! like a crossbow!  

MONICA:
  sorry. thank you. bye.  sixty people.  

RACHEL:
 oh my god! what happened?  

MONICA:
 sixty guests.  

ROSS:
 so, uh, why did you have to turn it down?  

MONICA:
 because i don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. i mean there's no way.  

PHOEBE:
 wow, what is with all the negativity? you sound like monican't , not monican...  around with this catering thing for over three years. do you want to be a caterer or not?  

MONICA:
 i don't know.  

PHOEBE:
 there you go, that's the spirit! okay! now, if you need money, i will lend you money, but just get moving!  

MONICA:
 really? cause i'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.  

PHOEBE:
 okay! it's worth it, if it will get you moving. you haven't worked in months.  

MONICA:
 well, you're not working either.  

PHOEBE:
 yes, but i'm doing this.  

MONICA:
 yeah, that'd be great! thank you!   

JOEY:
 hey!  

 hey.  

 can i borrow the keys to your apartment?  

JOEY:
 why?   

JOEY:
 you can pee here!  

 ahahaha... haha.. yes i can, of course. excuse me.  

CHANDLER:
 it's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.   hey joe! what are you getting kathy for her birthday?  

JOEY:
 we've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think i gotta get her something?  

 yeah!  

RACHEL:
 yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.  

JOEY:
 oh, i know...  

RACHEL:
 and not one of your coupons for an hour of "joey love."     

PHOEBE:
 ooo, a crossword! can i help?  

RACHEL:
 no! i'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help.  

PHOEBE:
 fine. but you can't help me develop my new universal language.   

MONICA:
 hey!  

RACHEL:
 hey, how'd it go?  

MONICA:
 oh my god, it was the best funeral ever! i mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? i even got another funeral for tomorrowthe dead-guy-from-today's best friend. i mean, it is like i am the official caterer for that accident!  

PHOEBE:
 mon! i'm so happy for you!  

MONICA:
 thanks. like, check out my new catering stuff.   look at this! i'm an omelet station! omelet? made to order!  

PHOEBE:
 i'll have one, please. plus my money.  

MONICA:
 oh. well, i didn't realize that you needed it back right away. i mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. so i went. i beed. i mean, i... i used it to buy all this stuff. but looki've got another job tomorrow, so i'll pay you back with the money i make from that.  

PHOEBE:
 oh. okay. oo, sorry i acted like a bank.  

MONICA:
 okay.   

ROSS:
  

 um, would you like to come in?  

ROSS:
 did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?  

 according to recent findings!   and landed in her living room. there are clothes and food and junk covering every square  

  

ROSS:
 mitzi is.....  

 my hamster. i hope she's okay, i haven't seen her in a while. have a seat.  

ROSS:
   ...do you have any, um, cinnamon fruit toasties?  

 what?  

ROSS:
 well, i do! why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of cinnamon fruit toasties, uh...  

 i'd rather not.  

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, why not?  

 okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.   

MONICA:
 oh, is everything in the car?  

PHOEBE:
 yes. did you settle the bill?  

MONICA:
 no. i hate this part.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, look what we almost left.  

MONICA:
 no, that's not mine.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, all right. oh! look what we almost took!     

MONICA:
 excuse me, mrs. burkart? well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.  

 oh, good. thank you.  

MONICA:
 um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...  

 dear?  

MONICA:
 just the matter of ...payment?  

     

RACHEL:
 you know what we should all do? go see a musical.  

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:
 and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one?  

CHANDLER:
 i don't know... um, grease?  

RACHEL:
 no....  

CHANDLER:
 rent?  

RACHEL:
 yes! rent!  

CHANDLER:
 okay, so when do you want to go?  

RACHEL:
 what? oh, i'm sorry, i can't, i'm busy.  

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
 yes, it is, at office max.  

RACHEL:
 what did you get her?    

CHANDLER:
 a pen. 

JOEY:
 it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock! huh?  

CHANDLER:
 huh-huh! you can't give her that.  

JOEY:
 why not?  

CHANDLER:
 because she's not eleven! and it's not the seventh night of hanukkah!  

RACHEL:
 okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?  

JOEY:
 sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "whoa! it's time for my date with joey!"  

CHANDLER:
 all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday?  

JOEY:
 she didn't have a birthday while we were going out.  

CHANDLER:
 for three years?  

JOEY:
  audition. i can't shop anymore! i...  

CHANDLER:
 all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay?  

JOEY:
 thanks, man. and oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?  

CHANDLER:
 would you like me to write her a little poem as well?  

JOEY:
 or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.   

PHOEBE:
 but mon, you have to get our money!  

MONICA:
 oh, phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! with those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.  

PHOEBE:
 i know, it's tough. you know what the first thing i did after my mother's funeral was?  

MONICA:
 what?  

PHOEBE:
 pay the caterer! look, i've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. it's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "i don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. bad little white girl!"  

MONICA:
 okay. so what do you.... you think she's faking?  

PHOEBE:
 well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.  

MONICA:
 phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.   

  forever in peace may you wave....  

PHOEBE:
 she seems fine now.  

   commercial break    

JOEY:
 so, you just left? her place was really that bad?  

ROSS:
 you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?  

JOEY:
 yeah.  

ROSS:
 well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!   here.  

JOEY:
 wow. thanks. so, uh, what happened?  

ROSS:
 what do you mean? nothing happened! i had to get out of there.  

JOEY:
 all right, so... next time, you take her to your place.  

ROSS:
 no, i tried that. she says it has a weird smell.  

JOEY:
 what kind of smell?  

ROSS:
 i don't know. soap?  

JOEY:
 all right, listen, ross... you like this girl, right?  

ROSS:
 yeah.  

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called "invisible things for kathy."  hand with all this stuff?  

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

 no, i... i didn't mean the pen. thank you for the book.  

CHANDLER:
 uh, the book?  

 the velveteen rabbit. i kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.  

CHANDLER:
 what do you mean?  

 well, uh, when joey gave it to me, he said, "this is 'cause i know ya like rabbits, and i know ya like cheese." thanks. i love it. and i know how hard it must have been for you to find.  

CHANDLER:
  was, "uhl, ell."  

 you must really like... joey... to go to all that trouble for him.  

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.  

 well....  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
   closing credits  

MONICA:
 hi. uh, you... you don't know me, i'm monica geller... ross's sister.  

 oh, yeah. oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.  

MONICA:
 yeah. anyway, he told me about your apartment. and, um, i couldn't sleep, thinking about it. so, uh, would it be okay if i cleaned it?   

CHANDLER:
  naked! it was like torture!

ROSS:
 y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a big surprise.

CHANDLER:
 it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean its bad enough that im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, i think she knows. because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us. and call me crazy, but i think she likes me too. and now i have seen her naked. i mean at least when ive seen her with clothes on, i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. but there are no boles, shes smooth! smooth!  

PHOEBE:
 wow! could everyone totally see up his robe?

 yeah! oh my god! opening credits  

 here you go.

JOEY:
 great! all right, so ill call you later.

 great! 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 that would be casey. were going out tonight.

CHANDLER:
 goin out, huh? wow! wow!  things didnt work out with kathy, huh? bummer.

JOEY:
 no, things are fine with kathy. im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with casey.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah. and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself! 

CHANDLER:
 wait! youre going out with kathy!

JOEY:
 yeah. why are you getting so upset?

CHANDLER:
 well, im upsetfor you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.  

JOEY:
 what is the big deal? its not like were exclusive.

CHANDLER:
 look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.

JOEY:
 you got all that from the back of her head?

CHANDLER:
 all right look, i think its time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane.

JOEY:
 whos elaine?  

PHOEBE:
  swinging with the greatest of ease" darn it! now, i dont know who to get to the next verse.

ROSS:
 oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease   bah-bah-bha-bhannn." then go right into it.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, ooh, i like that! yeah. wait! how do you know about bah-bah-bha-bhan?

ROSS:
 well umm, yknow, i used to play.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, thats right, the keyboards, huh?

ROSS:
 yeah, just a little in high school, but then i really got into it in college. i mean thats-thats when i really found my sound. 

MONICA:
 oh god! orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. oh my god, i completely forgot about your sound.

ROSS:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 he used to lock himself in the basement for hours. no one was every allowed to hear, "the sound."

PHOEBE:
 i wanna hear "the sound."

ROSS:
 really? no. i mean, nah, i havent played in so long, and-and, well its-its really personal stuff, yknow?

PHOEBE:
 come on, play that funky music white boy.

MONICA:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 no, you guys, i mean my keyboards are all the way up inno, yeah, okay.   

ROSS:
 okay, guys.

CHANDLER:
 all right! bring it on, you

ROSS:
 here we go.  my stuff for anyone before, so its important that-that you understand its about communicating very private emotions.  should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. thats what im

CHANDLER:
   the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam, someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes, 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 really, bitchin!

PHOEBE:
 wow, it was sowow!

ROSS:
 really?! i mean, really?!!

RACHEL:
 yeah, i mean, you should play in public!

ROSS:
 wow! thanks, you guys. thats uhohhh, i wanna, i wanna play you another piece! umm! uh-oh! i left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. ill be right back! okay?  

MONICA:
 oh god bless my dad sound proofing the basement!

RACHEL:
 oh, i cant believe i ever let him touch me with those fingers.

PHOEBE:
 what are you guys talking about, i loved it! it was soo moving. oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear.

CHANDLER:
 you mean like, music?  

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i know what youre thinkin! yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy. 

CHANDLER:
 come in!

 

CHANDLER:
 uh yes, but uh, i just watch it for the articles.

CHANDLER:
 no-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. so uh, come on in. have a seat. bow or stern?

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

 oh, okay.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i think it is!

 so what did you do today?

CHANDLER:
 oh, i had an appointment to get my haircut

 

CHANDLER:

 well, i could cut it.

CHANDLER:

 yeah, i do. of course, i learned at my aunts dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 well, thanks. i grow it myself.   yknow who also has great hair is joey!

 yes! yeah! joey has great hair! umm, im basically done here. just let me get this off your neck.  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
  man, how did you afford this stuff?

CHANDLER:
 well, yknow im 29. i mean who needs a savings account.

JOEY:
 oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.

CHANDLER:
 oh, i dont know.

JOEY:
 oh-no-no-no, you are! you do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, i was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, im gonna do that.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 no-no-no, i think im gonna see how things go with kathy. shes pretty cool.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 no-no, kathy.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 that all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! 

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey! you were really great! you were really, really great!

ROSS:
 oh, thanks, thanks. so monica tells me that uh, you dont want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. is that true?

PHOEBE:
 well, kinda. yeah. yeah.

ROSS:
 pheebs

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i-i canti mean yknow i was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, i justi feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. i

ROSS:
 see but, pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. yknow my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then i i wont play anymore.

PHOEBE:
 oh no. no-no-no, dont do that! how could i live with myself if i knew i was depriving the world of your music.

ROSS:
 yeah, okay.  

ROSS:
 hey chandler! saw the new furniture. very nice.

MONICA:
 yeah! joey has the best boyfriend ever!

CHANDLER:
 i kissed kathy.

ROSS:
 what?

MONICA:
 are you serious?

PHOEBE:
 does joey know?

CHANDLER:
 no. is there anyway, anyway you think hell understand this?

MONICA:
 you obviously havent screwed over a lot of your friends.   which we all appreciate.

ROSS:
 no the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside.

CHANDLER:
 oh, dont say that! dont say that. thats not true. is it?

PHOEBE:
 i think maybe, yeah.

MONICA:
 he loves you.

CHANDLER:
 then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!

ROSS:
 well, i said-i said something to phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! no, thats right. and i thought it was a really good idea.

RACHEL:
 i know, i remember that!

MONICA:
 i remember you did.

CHANDLER:
 god!! 

RACHEL:
 well, chandler, youre gonna have to tell him.

CHANDLER:
 why?! why do i have to tell him?!

RACHEL:
 because you do.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i know.

ROSS:
 hey, would it be okay if i wrote a song about this. 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey! samboucha margarita? 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 whats up?

CHANDLER:
 its-its about kathy. umm, uh, i like her. i like her a lot actually.

JOEY:
 you do?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 well, youre timing couldnt be better. shes not my girlfriend anymore.

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 yeah, she broke up with me.

CHANDLER:
 oh uh, when?

JOEY:
 just now, after acting class. at first i thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why i let people watch.

CHANDLER:
 oh man, i am so sorry. are, are you okay?

JOEY:
 well, ive been better. but, im all right. so you like her huh?

CHANDLER:
 yes, but i-i uh, dont have too.

JOEY:
 no-no-no, no its uh, its okay.

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 yeah. you know why? cause you came to me first.

CHANDLER:
 well, i thought that would be the best thing to do.

JOEY:
 but hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out for you. cause when i talked to her, i kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy. so

CHANDLER:
 see uh, thats-thats actually what i wanted to talk to you about. i-i think i know who the other guy is.

JOEY:
 who?

CHANDLER:
 its me. im the other guy.

JOEY:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i mean when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking, and one thing to another and

JOEY:
 and what?! did you sleep with her?!

CHANDLER:
 no! no! no! i just kissed her.

JOEY:
 what?!! thats even worse!!

CHANDLER:
 how is that worse?!

JOEY:
 i dont know! but its the same!

CHANDLER:
 look, im sorry! but theres nothing i can do, i think im in love with her!

JOEY:
 who cares?! you went behind my back! i would never do that to you!

CHANDLER:
 youre right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line.

JOEY:
 over the line?! you-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! the line is a dot to you!

CHANDLER:
 yes. yes! right! and i feel horrible. you have to believe me!

JOEY:
 is that why you bought all this stuff?!   well, yknow what i will not watch your tv, i will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that im not gonna eat! you know why?!

CHANDLER:
 probably because

JOEY:
 because its all tainted with your betrayal. from now on this apartment is empty for me! and im not happy about you either.   oh, and just so you know, i made that bread for you.   closing credits  

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, hes lost it. hes totally lost it.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 phoebe, his music could not get any worse. there are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves. 

ROSS:
 thank you, thanks.  yknow, im not gonna play anymore,  set?

PHOEBE:
 after that? yeah! no, i mean if i can help.  

ROSS:
 yeah, like i could lose it.

RACHEL:
 what?

ROSS:
 i played bad on purpose guys. 

MONICA:
 okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
  same room as me, so i just thought id try and apologize over the phone. all i   

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 look i never should have kissed your girlfriend, but im   

JOEY:
 

  challenge.

JOEY:

 what is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything  opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 look everyone, its the spirit of thanksgiving!

RACHEL:
 so are things with you and joey any better?

CHANDLER:
 they couldnt be worse. i spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.

RACHEL:
 oh wow, eight hours? so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?

ROSS:
 should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?

RACHEL:
 you shouldnt.

PHOEBE:
 speaking of christmas, umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret santa, and then we each only buy one gift. and-and theres the added mystery of who gets who.

ROSS:
 who gets whom.  

RACHEL:
 well, im gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.

MONICA:
 we havent eaten yet!

RACHEL:
 i know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, i just 

CHANDLER:
 hey, by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa, cause i wanna trade for her.

PHOEBE:
 i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh!

CHANDLER:
 wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly?

PHOEBE:
 because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. come on, lets trade!

CHANDLER:
 oh thats not true! thats not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  dog. all right this sucks! i already got her this briefcase, and i had r.g. put on it 

PHOEBE:
 ohh.

MONICA:
 well, maybe you could give to somebody else. ooh, like ross geller.

CHANDLER:
 op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase.

MONICA:
 who cares? he works in a museum!

CHANDLER:
 hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start!

PHOEBE:
 you dont have to do that, ross and joey arent here, you can watch the parade if you want.

CHANDLER:
 thanks.

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 oh my god, ice just got in my eye!

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.

PHOEBE:
 open it up, let me see.

MONICA:
 oh, yknow what, i cant, it really kills.

CHANDLER:
 well maybe you should put some ice on it.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, god it looks bad.

RACHEL:
 honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.

MONICA:
 no, my eye doctor is richard! i cant go to him when i dont have a boyfriend!

CHANDLER:
 hes really picky about his patients.

PHOEBE:
 honey, youve got to go. whats his office number?

MONICA:
 like i remember his office number! 

PHOEBE:
  eye, and is um, is richard burke in today.  but does she want to see the on-call doctor?

MONICA:
 yes!!

PHOEBE:
 yes! shes very excited about that. 

PHOEBE:
 this is so cool, til monica gets back, its like im head chef and i get to make all the decisions.  

ROSS:
 hey-hey, i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!

PHOEBE:
 okay, get out of my kitchen!

CHANDLER:
  joey, when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! 

PHOEBE:
 all right i i gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.

ROSS:
 so listen ah, i picked monica for secret santa, but im already getting her something for chanukah, i was wondering if you wanna switch.

CHANDLER:
 oh yknow what, i was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.

ROSS:
 really?! wow! thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me?

CHANDLER:
 i dont know r.g., i was thinking something girlie for your office.

ROSS:
 yeah, well maybe phoebe will switch with me.

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.

ROSS:
 oh, thats not true! ive got her lots of stuff she never took back.

CHANDLER:
 like?

ROSS:
 like uh, that gold necklace i got her last year.

CHANDLER:
 when was the last time you saw her wear it?

ROSS:
 well, she wore it all christmas day, and then uh

CHANDLER:
 big dog? 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 hey!

ROSS:
 what are you doing?

JOEY:
 im sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt.

ROSS:
 everything? even the tv?

JOEY:
 no! im putting that in my room.

ROSS:
 listen, joey, i know what he did was wrong but dont you think you could at least hear the guy out?

JOEY:
 back when you and rachel were together, if chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?

ROSS:
 thats a good point. so uh, how long are you gonna punish him?

JOEY:
 five years. 

ROSS:
 youve sentenced him?!

JOEY:
 hey! dont do the crime if you cant do the time.

ROSS:
 joey, the guys your best friend.

JOEY:
 no, was my best friend. anyway, i dont know why youre pushing for him so hard. with him out of the way as my best friend, theres a spot open.

ROSS:
 oh, who? me?

JOEY:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 wow! im honored! and yknow what im gonna do as my first act as your best friend?

JOEY:
 what?

ROSS:
 im gonna get you to talk to chandler.

JOEY:
 all right. but if you werent my best friend.  

 oh my god, is it really that bad?

CHANDLER:
 i walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in italian. and i know he only knows the bad words.

JOEY:
 

 i thought you were chandler. but umm, one of who is over there. 

 oh.

CHANDLER:
 hey joe.

JOEY:
  

 ill be right with you. okay? 

MONICA:
 oh my god! how cute is the on-call doctor?

RACHEL:
 ooh, so cute, that im thinking about jamming this pen in my eye. 

 dr. burke will see you know.

MONICA:
 oh no-no-no, not dr. burke. dr. burke is out of town. the-the on-call doctor will see me now.

 dr. richard burke is out of town. dr. timothy burke, his son, will see you now.

 ready?  

CHANDLER:
 hey! im sorry! that where are you going?

JOEY:
 my folks.

CHANDLER:
 oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?

JOEY:
 i dont know. i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment.

CHANDLER:
 what?!

JOEY:
 yeah, yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together i dont think i

CHANDLER:
 hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say that ill stop seeing her?

JOEY:
 look, its not about her. okay? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. and i dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. so, ill see ya.  

CHANDLER:
 hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up!

JOEY:
 yeah! you did! and thats why im leaving. 

CHANDLER:
 all right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! okay, they have had a very difficult year! what with the robbery and all!

JOEY:
 when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what i was doing in there all that time? i was thinking about how i let you down! 

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 yeah! but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, i wouldnt have worried about it so much! see you around!

CHANDLER:
 all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that i can do! something! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down. 

JOEY:
 weve got a box.  commercial break 

 last time i saw you, it was the morning i left for college. and you were just standing outside the dairy queen.

MONICA:
 i was probably waiting for it to open.

 i gotta tell you, you look great now.

MONICA:
 you look great too.

 youre an excellent patient!

MONICA:
 so how does it look?

 well, youve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.

MONICA:
 like a pirate?!

 if that helps you. 

MONICA:
 umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  come on, one of us had to mention him.

 i moved back here a couple of months ago.

MONICA:
 oh. big family dinner tonight?

 uh. 

MONICA:
 no way!

 i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriends.

MONICA:
 

 but we broke up.

MONICA:
 

 she-she wasnt ready for a serious commitment.

MONICA:
  plank? aye, matie?

 youre not wearing the patch yet.

MONICA:
 i know.  

ROSS:
 hes coming here for thanksgiving!

RACHEL:
 i know, its sick.

MONICA:
 why is it sick?

RACHEL:
 because its richards son! its like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner!

MONICA:
 hey, come on, phoebe, you understand dont you?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i can see where id be your best shot but, no. im sorry, but i think its twisted.

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 me going out with richards son.

JOEY:
 ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew!

CHANDLER:
  idea to me.

RACHEL:
 is he okay in there?

JOEY:
 hes fine!

ROSS:
 hey, y'know, mon, if things wrong out between you and richards son, youd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.

MONICA:
 fine! judge all you want to but,   dancer,  livin in a box!! 

RACHEL:
 so now, what exactly is the point of the box?

JOEY:
 chandler?

CHANDLER:
 the meaning of the box is three fold. one  , it gives me the time to think about what i did. two  , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey. and three  , it hurts!

ROSS:
  year? can i see it?

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i just wanna check something.

RACHEL:
 okay. 

ROSS:
  see.

CHANDLER:
 air hole! air hole!! 

RACHEL:
  wear it all the time.

ROSS:
  silver.

RACHEL:
 huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. 

ROSS:
 oh my god! you actually exchanged it!

RACHEL:
 well isnt it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of?

ROSS:
 what did you get?

RACHEL:
 credit.  

MONICA:
  ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it! ill get it!

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
  

MONICA:

MONICA:

 thank you.

RACHEL:
 fancy soap? i thought we were savin that for the pope!

MONICA:
 see hes nice. right?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "thats not how your dad used to do it."

 wow! everything looks great! where should i sit?

MONICA:
 i saved you a seat. 

RACHEL:
  

PHOEBE:
 oh, ill get it. 

CHANDLER:
 gotcha! 

JOEY:
 that doesnt sound like thinking to me!

CHANDLER:
 sorry!

JOEY:
 yknow i dont think you should be talking at all in there! i think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay, you got it!

RACHEL:
 ross, can you pass me the yams?

ROSS:
 sure! oh, and joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.

RACHEL:
 would you stop?! what is the matter with you?!

MONICA:
 oh-ho-ho, weve got company.

ROSS:
 theres nothing the matter with me. see, im not completely devoid of sentiment, see i have feelings.

RACHEL:
 okay, fine.  

CHANDLER:
 you cant tell, but im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!

JOEY:
 all right, look! if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! this means something to me! and if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!

CHANDLER:
 youre right, and im sorry! this means a lot to me! i want you to be my friend again! i swear, i wont say another word tonight.

JOEY:
 so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?

CHANDLER:
 absolutely!

JOEY:
 that sounds like another word to me! are you gonna take this seriously?  

RACHEL:
 dont say that i have no sentiment!   this is a movie stub from our first date! this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  museum from the first time we were together. okay, maybe i exchange gifts sometimes, but i keep the things that matter! 

ROSS:
 i dont know what to say, im sorry. though, youre not supposed to take these.  actually, we had people looking for that.  

MONICA:
 

 here, let me help. 

MONICA:
 thank you.

 you-you have a very beautiful eye.

MONICA:
 yknow all my friends think this is weird. 

 yknow i-i thought it was gonna be weird, i mean i almost called and canceled, but it really isnt.

MONICA:
 i know! i mean its like me and your dad, thats a totally separate thing.

 oh, i totally agree.

MONICA:
 were just two people who find each other very attractive. right?  

 what?

MONICA:
 nothing. nothing.

 no-no really, was-was that not okay?

MONICA:
 no-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss

 oh my god! it didnt remind you of

MONICA:
 

 no, but it did! didnt it?!

MONICA:
 yeah!

 oh man!!

MONICA:
 i know!   

JOEY:
 ill get it. 

 

JOEY:
 hey.

 hey. listen, i want you to know how sorry i am

JOEY:
 thats okay. chandlers the one im mad at.

 well, im still sorry. is he here?

JOEY:
 in the box.

 

PHOEBE:
 oh, he-he cant talk right now.

 why not? whats going on?

PHOEBE:
 hes just trying to show joey how much he means to him.

 by being in a box?

RACHEL:
 joey, had reasons. 

PHOEBE:
 they were threefold.

 oh. well uh,  this easier. listen umm   listen i dont wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. i just, i cant stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and i dont wanna be the cause of that. so, i dont think we can see each other anymore. im gonna go to my moms in chicago, im gonna stay there for awhile. i think this couldve be something really amazing, but yknow this is probably for the best. yknow? im gonna miss you. good-bye, chandler.   

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 what?!

JOEY:
 he can still catch her! come on, get out of there!  out of there!

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh, in that case  that was me hopping on board.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 i dont know, i could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but theres this thing about bumblebees on the discovery channel that i was planning to watch.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 joey, you are gonna love this guy. gandolf is like the party wizard!

JOEY:
 well, why do you call him gandolf?

ROSS:
 gandolf the wizard.  of the rings in high school?

JOEY:
 no, i had sex in high school.  

RACHEL:
 oh, uh, joanna i was wondering if i could ask you something. theres an opening for an assistant buyer in junior miss

 

RACHEL:
 well, actually, i meant for me. the hiring committee is meeting people all day and

 oh. well, i wish i could say no, but you cant stay my assistant forever. neither can you sophie, but for different reasons.

RACHEL:
 god, i am so glad you dont have a problem with this, because if you did, i wouldnt even consider applying.

 really? well, in that case

RACHEL:
  problem.

 thats fine, actually im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face.

RACHEL:
 ohh! thats great!

 you know, junior miss is where i started. oh, i had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.

RACHEL:
 really?!

 no-ho-ho!  worry, im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy to get that job. although, i might need some convincing.

RACHEL:
 well, i, umm

 kidding! god, i feel wild today! 

CHANDLER:
 oh man! i am so excitedi may vomit!

JOEY:
 will you calm down, hes just a human guy.

CHANDLER:
 look you dont understand, gandolf is amazing. yknow youre never know whats gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to nova scotia! 

JOEY:
 really?!

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, its beautiful country up there.

ROSS:
  kit!

CHANDLER:
 its not gonna be exactly like last time.

JOEY:
 all right, ill see you guys.

 whoa-whoa-whoa!

CHANDLER:
 whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

JOEY:
 i have an audition, but ill definitely hook up with you later. where are you gonna be around noon?

ROSS:
 somewhere maybe along the equator?

JOEY:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
   so, are you in town?  

ROSS:
 what happened?

CHANDLER:
 hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in chicago.

ROSS:
 ohh, man! chicago, is sooo lucky!

CHANDLER:
 stupid, useless canadian money!  

 you have a very impressive resume, ms. green. i especially like what i see here about implementing a new filing system.

RACHEL:
 thank you.

 filing system? oh-oh! you mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?  filing cabinets. 

RACHEL:
 well, they uh, they-they do more than that.

 i notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.

RACHEL:
 yes, joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.

 oh. and rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. its amazing how she gets it right almost every time!

RACHEL:
 i-i-i of course, i have more responsibilities than that.

 oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  carry two things at once!

 yes, thats very good. now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.

RACHEL:
 yes, i realize that

  only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what i mean.

RACHEL:
 i love working with designers!

 with them, under them, whats the difference? eh, rach?  

MONICA:
 hey! my first review is out!

PHOEBE:
 ohh! oh, the chelsea reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.

MONICA:
 all right, look at my on the back page.

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay!  but id have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." 

MONICA:
 hey, they dont pay me a penny a word to make friends.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, i gotta go. i found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.

MONICA:
 oh! do you need me to go with you?

PHOEBE:
 no-no, its okay. but are we sure we dont want the waterbed?

MONICA:
 havent we made this decision?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, all right. 

MONICA:
 bye!

PHOEBE:
 bye! 

MONICA:
 

 its allesandro, from allesandros.

MONICA:
 oh my god.

 i want to talk to you about your review.

MONICA:
 oh my god, oh my god. 

 why? so you could hang up on me?

MONICA:
 look, i-im never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.

 just give me a chance too

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 no! phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 hey, monica! commercial break 

  inedible swill!

MONICA:
 i couldnt eat it! i had five friends who couldnt eat it, and one of them eats books.

 well our service is not grossly incompetent.

MONICA:
 the waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!

 well, you said that we except the discover card, which we do not!

MONICA:
 all right, that ill retract. but i stand by my review, i know food and that wasnt it. youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! you should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. 

 hey! im proud of that sauce, its delicious.

MONICA:
 oh my god! you own an italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! where are you even from?

 

MONICA:
 hand me those tomatoes, im gonna show you what it should taste like! come on, hand me them.

 how long is this gonna take? cause i got another critic to go yell at. 

RACHEL:
  interview.

 i thought it went very well.

RACHEL:
 no! it didnt! thats what i want to talk to you about.  not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.

 rachel, please, dont make a scene.

RACHEL:
 theres nobody here!

 sophie, get in here!  sophie uncomfortable!

 shes not making me uncomfortable.

 congratulations! you now just crossed the line into completely useless. get out. 

RACHEL:
 do you want me to quit?

 what?! what would make you think that?

RACHEL:
 well of those things that you said in the interview, i mean if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant. yknow what? i am just gonna pack up my desk,   and i will be gone by the end of the day!   well, i guess theres no use to me sticking around til the end of the day! 

 wait-wait-wait-wait! you can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer. if you must know the truth, i didnt want to lose a perfectly good assistant.

RACHEL:
 what?

 thats why i said all those things about your flirting and your drinking

RACHEL:
 my drinking? 

 oh, i mustve said that after you left.

RACHEL:
 said what? exactly.

 that you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.

RACHEL:
 oh my god!! ohh, that is it! im leaving! you are just a horrible person!

 wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! if youre gonna get all sensitive about it! i dont want to lose you. what if i, create a position for you? ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.

RACHEL:
 say more things like that.

 you can have your own office, and a raise! effective tomorrow.

RACHEL:
 id need an expense account.

 done!

RACHEL:
 and an assistant.

 sophie, get in here!  

JOEY:
 hey! what are you guys doing here? i thought youd be out partying with gandel-worf.

ROSS:
 its gandolf, and hes not coming.

JOEY:
 so youve been sittin around here all mornin?

ROSS:
 no! i balanced my checkbook. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, and i-i gave first names to all of the foosball players.

ROSS:
 i cant believe he didnt come!

JOEY:
 so what if he didnt come! we can still go out and party ourselves!

CHANDLER:
 oh-no, yknow with gandolf wed be out all night!

ROSS:
 yeah! wed meet, wed meet total strangers, and hang out with them!

JOEY:
 well, we could do that! 

ROSS:
 theres other stuff too.

JOEY:
 well do it all, and better! look, after tonight, gandolf will want to party with us, dude! come on!

ROSS:
 yeah!

JOEY:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 yeah!!

JOEY:
 yeah!! 

ROSS:
 its not like we dont know how to party!!

JOEY:
 yeah! all right? lets go!

CHANDLER:
 and may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?

 yeah!!!

CHANDLER:
 all right!!

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?

ROSS:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 well, those were seals, man. 

RACHEL:
 hey mon, little question for ya! how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?

MONICA:
 okay, the owner of allesandros came over to yell at me, but instead i made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!

RACHEL:
 oh my god!! you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but im soo happy!

MONICA:
 can you believe it? i finally get to run my own kitchen!

RACHEL:
 ohh, youve waited soo long. 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 hey, pheebs, quick question for ya.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdales?

PHOEBE:
 i dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and 

RACHEL:
 yes!!!

MONICA:
 you got the job?! why didnt you tell me?

RACHEL:
 ohh, its gonna be so great! im gonna get to help decide what we sell, im gonna have an office with walls and everything.  im gonna have walls!

PHOEBE:
 okay, is this the day of good news or what? i got us a job! the wedding reception.

MONICA:
 ohh! umm, phoebe, i kinda need to talk to you about that.   umm, well i-i-i think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.

PHOEBE:
 but weve only had one job.

MONICA:
 i know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like its snowballing, yknow?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! what are you saying?

MONICA:
 i got offered the head chef job at allesandros.

PHOEBE:
 what?

MONICA:
 its okay, cause y'know what? you dont really need me for the business.

PHOEBE:
 youre the cook! with out you its just me driving up to peoples houses with empty trays and asking for money!

MONICA:
 all right. but umm, i-i-ill pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.

PHOEBE:
 for what? i cant believe this! i gotta get out of here. 

MONICA:
 phoebe, wait a minute! 

RACHEL:
 im an assistant buyer!!  

JOEY:
 all right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, all right.

ROSS:
 okay.

JOEY:
 so, were having fun, right?

 yeah.

JOEY:
 we dont need that wizard guy. we hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, well head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.

ROSS:
 im kinda beat.

CHANDLER:
 actually, me too.

JOEY:
 are you serious?!

 yeah.

JOEY:
 thank god! im exhausted!

 so you guys want coffees?

JOEY:
 yeah, but uh, i dont want to be up too late, so uh, ill have a decaf. 

ROSS:
 yeah, me too.

CHANDLER:
 actually, can i get some hot water with a little lemon? i think i strained my voice screaming in there. does it have to be so loud?

JOEY:
 i cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad.

ROSS:
 im just glad i brought that extra pair of socks, yknow? i used them as mittens, i didnt want to touch a thing in that last place. 

ROSS:
 how sad are we?

JOEY:
 yeah, i know.

CHANDLER:
 yknow what? were not sad, were not sad, were just not 21 anymore. yknow? im 29 years old, damnit! and i want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!

 yeah!

JOEY:
 yeah! and i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends.

 yeah!

ROSS:
 and so what if i like to go home, throw on some kenny g, and take a bath!

JOEY:
 were 29, were not women. 

MONICA:
  decided to hear me out.

PHOEBE:
 okay, im hearing.

MONICA:
 ive been doing a lot of thinking. a lot! and umm, well, i came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.

PHOEBE:
 what?!

MONICA:
 or! a bakery delivery person.

PHOEBE:
 i wa-i wa-i wa

MONICA:
 pizza?!

PHOEBE:
 monica! 

MONICA:
 all right, ive got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, im getting the feeling that you dont want to deliver.

PHOEBE:
 no.

MONICA:
 okay. im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, you probably dont want to pick stuff up either.

PHOEBE:
 no.

MONICA:
 yknow what, lets do the catering business.

PHOEBE:
 really?! are you sure?

MONICA:
 yeah, y'know i-i made a commitment to you. yknow what, itd be, itd be fun.

PHOEBE:
 oh! it will be fun! ohh! yay! oh! okay, ooh, lets plan the wedding reception.   wow! you really wanted me to do something with this van.  yknow what, i want you to take the chef job.

MONICA:
 really?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah. thats what you really want. yeah, i dont want to be the reason youre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and i really dont want to be the reason im unhappy.

MONICA:
 thank you.

PHOEBE:
 besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new a-team.  

RACHEL:
 oh, hi mrs. lynch! is joanna in already?

 oh my goodness! you havent heard!

RACHEL:
 heard what?

 joanna passed away last night.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! how?!

 well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! oh, i cannot believe it!

 i know!

RACHEL:
 oh, god. oh, god. 

 i didnt realize that she was so close.

RACHEL:
 yes, so close. mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. but by any chance did joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened.

 no. nothing. imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.

RACHEL:
 yes-yes, just a few seconds and shed still be with usnothing about an assistant buyer?

  

 

RACHEL:
 oh, sophie, i guess you didnt hear about joanna

 i sure did!  closing credits 

 im so excited about having monica come on board with us. although i do feel bad about having fired chef emillio, its like losing a member of the family. of course, that literally is the case for several of you. tony, carlos, marie, please, tell your father how much were gonna miss him. now, i know that monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. so without much further ado, i present to you our new head chef.

ROSS:
 hey! 

 hey!

ROSS:
 im sorry im late, did i miss anything?

PHOEBE:
 joey stuffing 15 oreos in his mouth.  

ROSS:
 15?  

PHOEBE:
 where were you?

ROSS:
 oh, on a date. yeah, i met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah! how did you meet her?

PHOEBE:
 oh, which museum?

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and i sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. she was totally at my mercy.

CHANDLER:
 were you so late because you were burring this woman?

ROSS:
 no, im getting back down cause she lives in poughkeepsie. she seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.

CHANDLER:
 how can she be great if shes from poughkeepsie?   that joke wouldve killed in albany.

JOEY:
 done! i did it! heh, whos stupid now?   opening credits 

CHANDLER:
 hey, look at this!  christmas tree tonight.

PHOEBE:
 umm, that papers two weeks old. 

CHANDLER:
 all right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! i really wanted to take kathy to this, i cant believe i missed it.

RACHEL:
 hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! i hate being alone this time of year! next thing you know itll be valentines day, then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree again. ohh, i want somebody!  yknow, i want a man!!  doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be great.

CHANDLER:
 really?! i didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling.

RACHEL:
 well, believe me, its been a long time since ive been flung.

JOEY:
 well, i know what im giving you for christmas.

CHANDLER:
 yknow what? theres some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?

RACHEL:
 yeah! wait a minute, its been a long time that ive been single. how come you never offered this before?

CHANDLER:
 well, i have a girlfriend, im-im happy. so, i no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.

RACHEL:
 okay! no accountants. oh, and no one from like legal. i dont like guys with boring jobs.

CHANDLER:
 oh and ross was like what? a lion tamer? 

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 whats wrong mon?

MONICA:
 ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

MONICA:
 i thought i was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, i get off work and i find out that they wrote this  hat. 

PHOEBE:
 hey, maybe they meant to write, quiet, bitch.

RACHEL:
 hey, honey! whats the matter?  was just trying to be nice! whoa!

MONICA:
 i mean i have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.  

JOEY:
 ohhh!

MONICA:
 i mean theyre trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, i would. but this is something ive been waiting for my whole life.

RACHEL:
 well, wait a minute, youre the boss! why dont you just yell at them? or, fire them?

MONICA:
 i would love too, but i cant! i mean i just cant, you know that im not good at confrontation.

CHANDLER:
 hey, you know what you can do? i remember reading about this director, i think it was orson wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. then they would all know, whos boss.

JOEY:
 hey, mon! im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?

MONICA:
 thats a good idea! wait, do you know how to waiter?

JOEY:
 good enough to get fired.

MONICA:
 all right, youre hired!

JOEY:
 hey! that must be why i got fired last week! does this orson wells guy direct burger king commercials?

CHANDLER:
  

CHANDLER:
 i say, drew! are you seeing anybody right now?  og-ee-op, im not asking for me, im i mean no, im-im not gay, im not asking you out. im not-im not-im not gay!

 i didnt think you were gay. i do now.

CHANDLER:
 see my friend-my friend, rachel, she wants to be set up.

 ahh, i just got out of a big relationship, im not looking for any thing serious.

CHANDLER:
 oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with rachel.

 whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! is this, hot rachel, that you took to the christmas party, rachel?

CHANDLER:
 

 oh wow! im free for her!

 oh, wait a second! i didnt say i wasnt free!

 hey, chandler, why dont we talk this over at the ranger game tomorrow?

 hold on, yknow i just got a box of cubans, maybe i bring them by your office around uh, five?

CHANDLER:
 oh well, thats uh, a little later than i uh, generally care to stay, but sure!

 maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch basel hadens.

CHANDLER:
 well, i dont really know what that is, but lets!! 

PHOEBE:
 hey! you guys, im writing a holiday song for everyone. do you want to hear it?

 yes!

PHOEBE:
  happy new year, chandler and ross. spin the draddle, rachel!

RACHEL:
 pheebs, thats great!

PHOEBE:
 oh, yay!

RACHEL:
 but yknow umm, rachel doesnt rhyme with draddle.

PHOEBE:
 i know but its so hard! nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

JOEY:
 what are you talking about? lots of things rhyme with rachel. bagel. mail. jail. bail. able. may-pole.

PHOEBE:
 all good, thanks.  nickname thats easier to rhyme?

MONICA:
 didnt your dad used to call you pumpkin?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah!

PHOEBE:
 pumpkin? yeah. but did he ever call you like, budolph?

CHANDLER:
 

 hey!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, i just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! theyre buying me drinks! theyre giving me stuff!  knicks tonight?

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 wherever! ive got like 20!

RACHEL:
 so, will i like any of these guys?

CHANDLER:
 yknow what, im gonna uh, play the field just a little more.

RACHEL:
 chandler!

CHANDLER:
 guys are signing over their 401-ks to me?

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
  think youre gonna like him, hes really nice, hes funny, hes a swimmer.

RACHEL:
 ohh, i like swimmers bodies!

CHANDLER:
 yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.

RACHEL:
 op, i like credit cards!

CHANDLER:
 see, im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?

RACHEL:
 well, so what does he do?

CHANDLER:
 oh, he works in the fine foods division.

RACHEL:
 your company has a fine foods division?

CHANDLER:
 its a big company, i dontif youi

JOEY:
 now, wait a second! you make food and robots?

PHOEBE:
 no! no, the robots just work for them.

MONICA:
  problem with that?

JOEY:
 yeah, lady, i do! i got a problem with that!

MONICA:
 you want a problem? ill give you a problem!

JOEY:
 oh, what are you gonna do? youre gonna fire me?

MONICA:
 you bet your ass, im gonna fire you! thank you.  

ROSS:
 oh, wow! i should get going. i-i got a date tonight.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah! with who?

ROSS:
 you know that girl i told you about who lives up in poughkeepsie?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 not her. yeah, this is someone else i meet, and i-i cant decide between the two of them. yknow the one from poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. but this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, i guess shes smart, shes not fun.

PHOEBE:
 if shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?

ROSS:
 well, i-i want to give her another chance, yknow? she lives so close. and, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny. on the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey, man!

PHOEBE:
 hey! ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?

JOEY:
  

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey, what happened to your fancy chefs jacket?  

MONICA:
 they baked it. i cant take this anymore. im gonna call a meeting tonight, im gonna fire you tonight.

JOEY:
 you got it! oh-oh!  

MONICA:
 what are you doing?!

JOEY:
 its still a tiny bit on fire there.

MONICA:
 thanks.  

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, like father, like son.

RACHEL:
 patrick and i had such a great time last night! i mean i think this could maybe turn into something serious.

CHANDLER:
 really?! i-i thought you werent looking for something serious? i thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.

RACHEL:
 well, y'know, possibly.  right?

CHANDLER:
 ummmmmmmm, no.

RACHEL:
 you told this guy that i was looking for a fling?! you dont tell the guy that!

CHANDLER:
 why not?! id be thrilled if i heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh i see.

RACHEL:
 oh, between you telling him that i wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea. 

MONICA:
 hey, joey, could you pass the cheese?

JOEY:
 yeah. listen uh, id prefer it if you didnt call me joey. since i dont know anyone here, i thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.

  

JOEY:
  this one!

 yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. and it never hurts to wear tight trousers.

MONICA:
 okay. could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials? okay, first there is a chilean sea bass prepared with a mango relish on a bagwhy is nobody writing these down?

 because we can remember them.

MONICA:
 because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?

 well, sure, that too.

MONICA:
 okay, forget the specials for a minute. umm, all right heres the thing, for the last two weeks i have umm,  atmosphere

 cant hear you!

MONICA:
   from now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! all right? does anybody have a problem with that?!!   hey new guy! i said, does anybody have a problem with that?!

JOEY:
 no maam.

 hey! he has a name, its dragon. do you wanna know your name? check your hat.  commercial break  

MONICA:
 what the hell happened?!

JOEY:
 i am so-so-so sorry. i was gonna do it! really! but i was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and i was thinking, "wow! its been a long time since i had   327 + 238 dollars!"

MONICA:
 joey, we had a deal. that-thats why youre here! ive got to fire you!

JOEY:
 and i gotta pay rent! look, how-how about this? you dont fire me, instead i stay here, i gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nice things ive been saying about you.

MONICA:
 what kinda things have you been saying?

JOEY:
 well nothing yet, they really hate you and i want to fit in.  

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 im not jewish, so

PHOEBE:
 so! ross doesnt really decorate his tree with floss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? god!  

CHANDLER:
 bad dream?

ROSS:
 i wasnt sleeping.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, then uh, what was phoebes song about?

ROSS:
 the one with the cat. i gotta go, ive got another date.

PHOEBE:
 so, did you pick one yet?

ROSS:
 no, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. but it was a different joke than i thoughtit wasnt that funny. so im still torn.

PHOEBE:
 well look, you dont really like the one from uptown and youre too exhausted from dating the one up in poughkeepsie, so i say you just end them both. okay? you take a train up to poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. and then by the time you get home tonight, youre done!

ROSS:
 yknow, youre right. thank you.

PHOEBE:
 umm, well i had a similar problem when i lived in prague.

CHANDLER:
 prague?

PHOEBE:
 theres sooo much you dont know.  rachel sees this and holds the door open until chandler is ready to start his swing, when he is, she slams the door shut which causes the club to fly from his hands. he turns 

RACHEL:
 chandler! patrick just uh, ended things with me. did you or did you not tell him that i was looking for a serious relationship?

CHANDLER:
 i did! i absolutely did!

RACHEL:
 you idiot!!

CHANDLER:
 im sure youre right, but why?

RACHEL:
 you dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious relationship! you dont tell the guy that! now you scared him away!

CHANDLER:
 oh, man. im sorry, im so-so sorry.

RACHEL:
 yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people!

CHANDLER:
 i know! i know!

RACHEL:
 oh! see just im right back where i started! aww, this sucks! being alone, sucks! 

CHANDLER:
 well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody! youre a great catch! yknow when i was telling all those guys about you, i didnt have to lie once. 

RACHEL:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 yeah! you graduated magma ku laude, right?

RACHEL:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 oh, it doesnt matter.  yknow what, ive got two tickets to tonights rangers game, you wanna come with me?

RACHEL:
 cute guys in little shorts? sure.

CHANDLER:
 well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry canadians with no teeth.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

 uhh, yeah.

 weve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought wed get a jump on things, yknow no ones getting any younger.

 see the thing is umm, were not able to yknow, uh, conceive.

 and weve tried everything, weve seen a bunch of doctors.

 yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. so we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 no, pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.

 that is really nicelying! no way is that the reason!

RACHEL:
 why? just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?!

CHANDLER:
 no, hes right, im totally lying.  rosss little im-flicking-you-off-but-im-not-giving-you-the-finger 

MONICA:
 then what is it?

CHANDLER:
 well, kathys last boyfriend was joey.

ROSS:
 and youre afraid you wont be able tofill his shoes.

CHANDLER:
 no, im afraid i wont be able to make love as well as him.

ROSS:
 yeah, i was going for the metaphor.

CHANDLER:
 yes, and i was saying the actual words.

MONICA:
 so big deal, so joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.

CHANDLER:
 we share a wall! so either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.

MONICA:
 sweetie, with you its gonna be different. the sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 just go for it chandler.

MONICA:
 yeah, you should.

RACHEL:
 yeah, you should, really.

MONICA:
 go on.

CHANDLER:
 all right, all right, ill go sleep with my girlfriend. but im just doing it for you guys. 

JOEY:
 okay, now the mastodon is from the semi-late jurassic period.

 isnt the mastodon from the pliocene epic?

JOEY:
 shhh! this is a museum, no talking. right down here,   we have a large foot.   uhh, and over here we have ross geller.  hi to ross. ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.   okay, moving right along. come on. 

 its open! come in!

PHOEBE:
 hi!

 hi!

PHOEBE:
 im sorry, im late.

 oh, thats okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.

PHOEBE:
 wow! you really go all out when youre expecting company.

 no, i was working on my pottery.

PHOEBE:
 oh! ooh! oh, i didnt know that you didpot.

 well, yeah, mostly nudes. it combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, erotiery!

 hey! okay! well thanks for coming out to see me. i just-i just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. yknow

PHOEBE:
 okay.

 i really dont think its a very good idea, phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 why not?

 well, because youd be giving up a baby, and i-i really donti dont know if theres anything i can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. so, umm,  

PHOEBE:
 oh no! no-no! i understand the pain! dont-dont hurt the puppy.

 no-no-no, the-the puppys yours.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i get a puppy!!

 well, yeah! i mean yeah, but only for three days.

PHOEBE:
 why?

 i realise i dont have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm,   uhh phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, its very important. 

PHOEBE:
 okay.

 i mean, i know what im talking about. i gave up two babies, and i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. i just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. so, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.   i really shouldnt have given you the puppy first.

PHOEBE:
 all right, im sorry.  

JOEY:
 uhh, do you mind sitting there. im-im saving this for my friend ross.

 you mean dr. geller?

JOEY:
 doctor? wow! i didnt know he had a nickname.

 oh, he wont sit here. only the people in the white coats sit over there, 

JOEY:
 well, how-how come?

 thats just the way it is.

JOEY:
 thats crazy.

 maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. see that scientist in the classes, he and i used to play together all the time in grade school, but now puddin which you man! i gave you my snack pack!  he dont even here me!

JOEY:
 i-i think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. anyway, look, i dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but ross is one of my best friends, and if i save him a seat, im telling you, he will sit in it!  saved you seat.

ROSS:
 thats okay, im cool over here. ill catch up with you later, joey.   

 op, this is saved.  commercial break  

ROSS:
  the cafeteria today.

JOEY:
 its no big deal. hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. right?

ROSS:
 but hey, its not just me, i mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.

JOEY:
 whatever.

ROSS:
 its like that everywhere, joey! okay, mon, back me up here. where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?

MONICA:
 i eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.

JOEY:
 look, ross, really its-its no big deal. yknow you wear a white coat, i wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it. yknow, hey i understand. yknow? hey, when im in a play and youre in the audience, i dont talk to you, right? so its yknow, its uh, its cool. ill see you tomorrow. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave.  

CHANDLER:
 hi.

MONICA:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 why is phoebe singing to carl mulden?

PHOEBE:
 ooh, yknow what, i think its time for puppy to go out again. come on, lets go to the balcony.

MONICA:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 umm, the street. come on, lets go to the street. ooh, listen, dont go onto the balcony until after i get back. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 yes, yes, we had the sex.

MONICA:
 uh-oh, it was bad?

CHANDLER:
 it was fine, yknow? but she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with joey. she was more like, "i see you point, im all right with it."

MONICA:
 well, it was the first time. yknow, theres not always a lot of agreement the first time.

RACHEL:
 yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree 

CHANDLER:
 look, you have to help me! okay? i mean, i know what to do with a woman, yknow, i know where everything goes, its always nice. but i need to know what makes it go from nice to, "my god! somebodys killing her in there!"

MONICA:
 all right, im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont know. rach, give me that pad, please?  right. now

CHANDLER:
 look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! shes hot!

MONICA:
 now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.   you got one, two three, four  , five, six, and seven!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 let me see that. 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 its kind of an important one!

CHANDLER:
 oh, yknow-yknow what, i was looking at it upside down.

RACHEL:
 well, yknow, sometimes that helps.  

MONICA:
  up camp.

CHANDLER:
 that-thats bad?

RACHEL:
 well if you go to disneyland, you dont spend the whole day on the materhorn.

CHANDLER:
 well you might if it were anything like 7!

MONICA:
 all right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit em all, and you mix em up. you gotta keep them on their toes.

RACHEL:
 oo, toes!! well, for some people. 

MONICA:
 all right. umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  6-7, 7, 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7  

 dr. geller, theres a seat over here.  

ROSS:
 thank you, dr. phillips, but im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. im having lunch right here, with my good friend joey, if hell sit with me.

JOEY:
  

ROSS:
 y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. now, i look around this cafeteria, and yknow what i see, i see-i see division. division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and i ask myself, "my god why?!" now, i say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.   im ross! im divorced, and i have a kid!

JOEY:
  actor! i dont know squat about dinosaurs!

  moved here a month ago, and new york really scares me.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oo, i cant watch this, its like sophies choice.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 ooh, it was only okay.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, i cant do this. my mom was right. if i cant-if i cant give him up, then theres no way i can give up a baby. ohh, god, frank and alice are gonna be so crushed. what-what else, what else can i give ema kidney!

 

 hi!

 uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 what are you doing?

PHOEBE:

  means to us! oh!

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 five? okay, where am i giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?

 we do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 wow! she looks great. doesnt she?

ROSS:
 yeah.   

 hi!

 hi!

ROSS:
 that is one good looking man!

CHANDLER:
 is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!

 sooo, youve been doing this long?

 no, youre my first. put the money on the table.  

 oh, yeah! ooh, thats nice.  

ROSS:
 dude!

 is that an expensive blouse?

 if you want it to be.   

ROSS:
 heres your girlfriends button.  opening credits  

PHOEBE:
 oh, hey, mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?

MONICA:
 yeah, i think i have some around here somewhere. why? 

PHOEBE:
 well, its just that maternity clothes are so expensive. 

MONICA:
 hey, rach! i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. if you could just it.

RACHEL:
 bloomingdales eliminated my department. 

MONICA:
 oh my god, are you out of a job?

RACHEL:
 no, but they stuck me in personal shopping. which is just a huge step down!

PHOEBE:
 personal shopping? what is that? like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.

PHOEBE:
 that sounds great!

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. you cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. that fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.  

MONICA:
 what are you doing?

JOEY:
 i think i left a donut up here.  

ROSS:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 ooh! how was kathys play?

ROSS:
 well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!

PHOEBE:
 thats a good idea for a business!

CHANDLER:
 im totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. y'know itll be like, "so wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, chester?" and shell go, "no-no-no, its chandler." and hell go, "whatever. ha-ha-ha-ha!"

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 all right, look, look, what am i gonna do?

JOEY:
 chandler, look theyre actors. theyre there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them.

ROSS:
 oh-oh, alec baldwin and kim basinger.

JOEY:
 tom cruise and nicole kidman. 

ROSS:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood.

ROSS:
 theyre not a couple!

PHOEBE:
 oh-okay, i get the game now.

JOEY:
 okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?

ROSS:
 oh yeah!

JOEY:
 well okay, so then youre fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.

CHANDLER:
 really?

JOEY:
 look, you guys have been to every play ive ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?

ROSS:
 no.

JOEY:
 noooo!!  

CHANDLER:
 so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?

ROSS:
 yknow what, i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i know but

ROSS:
 oh no-no-no, im there.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 hey mon! want some pancakes?

MONICA:
 you made pancakes?

JOEY:
 yep! grab a plate.

MONICA:
 okay.  

JOEY:
 no-no, stay right there.   gettin closer.

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which im fairly certain are the same thing.

JOEY:
 listen also were uh, were watching the game here saturday night, if people want to come over.

ROSS:
 oh yeah!

MONICA:
 oh, i was thinking about having people over for the game.

JOEY:
 oh yeah, whos playing?

MONICA:
 the players.

ROSS:
 somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 all right pheebs, stick out your plate!

PHOEBE:
 oh.   

RACHEL:
  woman put on a thong and she didnt even buy it!  im quitting! thats it! im talking to my boss right now!  am!  get this message.  really need to talk to you.

 in a moment, please, im in the middle of a task. and you have a customer.   actually its tate donovan, so its not like shes really testing her 

RACHEL:
 hi!

 hi, im joshua.

RACHEL:
 hi, im rachel green. what can i do for you joshua?

 well, i need a whole new wardrobe. my wife, well my ex-wife

RACHEL:
 oh, im so sorry.  

 anyway, she burned all of my clothes. i got away with two things. this suit and what turned out to be a skirt.

RACHEL:
 well, at least thats a great suit.

 yeah, but it wasnt much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.  willing, im all yours.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 rachel, you needed to speak to me?

RACHEL:
 no-no, that wasnt me!  me show you my underwear.  

RACHEL:
 oh-oh, sorry, its this way, its this way.  

 its this way? sorry.    

CHANDLER:
 im right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now theres no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means!

ROSS:
 all right, lets not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them.

CHANDLER:
 come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!

ROSS:
 here she comes. dont say a word, okay? just be cool, dont bey'know you.

 hey you guys!

ROSS:
 hey!

 hi!  tonight?

ROSS:
 oh, absolutely! 

 wasnt nick funny when he couldnt get his match lit? 

 its a good play, isnt it? 

CHANDLER:
 oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly youre having sex with him.

ROSS:
 okay, i 

 clearly, im having sex with him?

CHANDLER:
 oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!

 okay, so let me just get this straight. youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?

CHANDLER:
 yknow, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.

 acting! chandler, this is my job! im-im playing a part in a play! how can you not trust me?!

CHANDLER:
 well, you can understand, given how we started.

 oh, wow. i cant believe youre throwing that in my face.

CHANDLER:
 well, that is what happened, and i dont even see you denying this!

 ill tell you what, chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon! commercial break  

RACHEL:
 i have the best job in the entire world! the most adorable guy came over today, and i got to dress him up all day!

PHOEBE:
 rachel has a new doll.

RACHEL:
 oh, i wish he was a doll, then i could get a rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. oh! and he has the most beautiful name, i never realised it, joshua! josh-u-a! joshua! josh.

ROSS:
 uh, hello!

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i dont need it.

MONICA:
 people are supposed to wanna hang out here!

RACHEL:
 why? honey, what is the big deal?

MONICA:
 im the hostess! not those guys! im always the hostess! i mean, i was always the hostess, i mean even when i was little, i mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, i-i served the best air.

PHOEBE:
 well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?

MONICA:
 cause they took our apartment, i wanted to punish them. but im-im done now. theyve suffered enough.

PHOEBE:
 if you wanted to punish them, you shouldve just made them hang out here! 

RACHEL:
 yeah, thats true.

MONICA:
 all right then, when im done with this place, its gonna be ten times better than that place!

PHOEBE:
 oh, are we gonna trash that place? 

CHANDLER:
 steps!   slut!   you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy!

 what?!

ROSS:
 so you were right?

CHANDLER:
 i confronted her, and she didnt deny it!  live here! 

ROSS:
 chandler!

RACHEL:
 chandler, what did she say?

PHOEBE:
 wait a minute.

JOEY:
 come here.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 ooh, i just feel bad, i never vacuum.   

RACHEL:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 so i was with joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. its just so frustrating!

PHOEBE:
 why dont you ask him out?

JOEY:
 oh, yeah, totally! thats such a turn-on!

RACHEL:
 really? it doesnt seem desperate?

JOEY:
 oh-ooh, thats the turn-on.

PHOEBE:
 he just got a divorce right? 

RACHEL:
 hmm-mmm.

PHOEBE:
 so hes probably really nervous around women, y'know? maybe, you just have to make the first move.

RACHEL:
 yeah but, ive never asked a guy out before.

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 no. have you?

PHOEBE:
 thousands of times!! that doesnt make me sound too good does it?

RACHEL:
 i dont even know how i would go about it.

JOEY:
 oh-oh-oh-oh, how i do it is, i look a woman up and down and say, "hey, how you doin?"

PHOEBE:
 oh, please!

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
 you know what, im gonna do that, im gonna call him up, and im gonna ask him out. i can do that. ask him out.    today? well, we found a wallet, and we good idea! uh, well, lets see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. ill see you tomorrow. bye. 

PHOEBE:
 ive never done that.

RACHEL:
 ohh, god, i just got so nervous that he would say no.

JOEY:
 well, you gotta give him something that he cant say no too. like uh, knicks tickets! invite the guy to a knicks game, youre guaranteed hell say yes!

RACHEL:
 really?! you think that will work?

JOEY:
 absolutely! and if it doesnt, can i get the extra ticket? 

JOEY:
 what the heck is that?    

CHANDLER:
 did she call?

PHOEBE:
 no, sorry.

CHANDLER:
 all right, maybe i should call her.

JOEY:
 no! forget her, man! you dont need her, you dont need that!

ROSS:
 hes right, what she did was unforgivable.

CHANDLER:
 well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if i was wrong?

ROSS:
 how might you be wrong?

CHANDLER:
 well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?

JOEY:
 dude, tell me she actually told you this.

CHANDLER:
 she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. back me up here, ross!

ROSS:
 thats all youre basing this on?

CHANDLER:
 thats not backing me up! look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. the lone gunman. communism. geometry.

CHANDLER:
 oh my god!!  

RACHEL:
 would you like to go to a basketball game with me?  know, its funny, basketball, because i happen to have tickets too  umm, who likes the knicks

CHANDLER:

 oh wow. i really wish youd call me.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i know, i-i wish i had too, but yknow i-i think this is a good thing. y'know? cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on. yknow, i know for me nicks pants?

 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 yeah. well, i think our second fight is going to be a big one!  rejection earlier that day and telling her what she shouldve done. ross and phoebe 

JOEY:
 okay, for next time, what do you say?

RACHEL:
 i have an extra ticket. an extra ticket. not, two tickets, i have an extra ticket.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 he didnt turn me down! hes at the game isnt he? i got the date, im just not on it!

MONICA:
 

JOEY:

ROSS:
 hey!

JOEY:
 howd it go?

CHANDLER:
 well, she wasnt sleeping with him.

PHOEBE:
 oh good!

CHANDLER:
 she is now.

ROSS:
 what are you saying?

CHANDLER:
 im saying that she is a devil woman! yknow i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick! nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! i hate him, i hate her! well, i dont hate her, i love her. this is all my fault really.

PHOEBE:
 how? how is your fault?

CHANDLER:
 because, i-i shouldve called! yknow if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with nick, and they wouldve ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples!

RACHEL:
 honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.

ROSS:
 well, if-if she thought they were on a break  closing credits  

 rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. a joshua bergen. 

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 whats phase two?

JOEY:
 gettin drunk and going to a strip club. 

RACHEL:
 how does going to a strip club help him better?

ROSS:
 because there are naked ladies there.

JOEY:
 which helps him get to phase three, picturing yourself with other women.

ROSS:
 there are naked ladies there too.

JOEY:
 yeah.

  she looked right at me! oh wait, you cant see people through that little hole, can you? 

 hello! 

RACHEL:
 ill be right there!  thought we have moved on! i thought weve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! i mean was that just me?

ROSS:
 all right, ill do it.

RACHEL:
 oh thank you! thank you, thank you, thank you!  emily?

 yes.

RACHEL:
 im rachel green.

 thank goodness.

RACHEL:
 theres been a teeny-teeny change in plans. it turns out that im not free tonight. so

 really?! well, thats just lovely, isnt it? i mustve missed your call, even though i didnt leave the flat all day. 

RACHEL:
 oh well, no i

 oh, no-no-no, thats not rude! its perfectly in keeping with a trip that ive already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at john f. kennedy airport, apparently to you people, i look like someone whos got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.

MONICA:
 i-i-i think you look great.

 good night, it was very nice to meet you all.  

RACHEL:
 ill get her.

ROSS:
 please hurry.

PHOEBE:
 dont you just love the way they talk?!  

PHOEBE:
 ohh!

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 it kicked! i think the baby kicked!

MONICA:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.

JOEY:
  the set a half an hour ago! i gotta get out of here!

MONICA:
 oh wait, joey, you cant go like that! you stink!

JOEY:
 look, i know i feel asleep before i could shower and now i dont have time! theyre just ten blocks away, if i run, i can make it.

MONICA:
 yeah. run ten blocks, thatll help the smell. 

RACHEL:
 heywhoa, slow down.   wow!

MONICA:
 so? how did it go with joshua last night?

RACHEL:
 well, i didnt see joshua last night, but i did punch a girl in the face.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 why?

RACHEL:
 the whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when i got there, there was no rachel green on the list, but there was a rachel greep.

PHOEBE:
 ohh! so, did you get to meet her?

RACHEL:
 no, there is no rachel greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "im rachel greep! im rachel greep!" and he let her right in. 

MONICA:
 so you hit her in the face?

RACHEL:
 no, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so i clocked her. ohhh! i cant believe this, all i wanted was a few hours outside of work to see joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 honey, thats youre name.

PHOEBE:
 thats short for phoebe?! i thought that was just what we called each other! 

MONICA:
 hey! youre wearing pants!

CHANDLER:
 thats right! where are the guys? im ready to get drunk and see some strippers.

MONICA:
 its 9:30 in the morning!

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 ooh, let me talk to him!

MONICA:
 oh-oh, my god!

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time.  

ROSS:
 when we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! who wouldnt be miserable? im telling you when i got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.

  fruit from the orchard!

ROSS:
 ive gotta go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!  

MONICA:
 he had to go, theres a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.

RACHEL:
 i dont get this! she was horrible! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, im going to go stand over there.  

MONICA:
 why do you care so much anyway?

RACHEL:
 i dont care! all right, yknow what im just upset that im getting nowhere with joshua thatyknow what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to vermont!

MONICA:
 well, when you first met barry, you flitted off to vail.

RACHEL:
 oh, yknow, would you just for once, not remember everylittlething!! 

CHANDLER:
 so yknow, uh, whens he getting back?

MONICA:
 a couple of days.

CHANDLER:
 yknow, i knew something like this was going to happen.  

MONICA:
 what are you doing?! chandler! you cant just go back a phase!

CHANDLER:
 yes you can. youre thinking about time, you cant go back in time.

PHOEBE:
 well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your phase two strip club thing with us.

MONICA:
 yeah, come on, we can be guys!

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 come on! let us be guys! maybe we want to be guys!

CHANDLER:
 you dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long. 

PHOEBE:
 yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

PHOEBE:
 im sorry.  

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 yeah, the man wreaks! smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice. 

 theres no way he smells, hes the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 oh yeah, yeah.

 i dont know one actor worth his salt that didnt say at one time or another, "god, i stink!" hell, i just did a scene out there, first take, i stunk the place up. but, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! do you understand me?!

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 oh no! wait! wait! okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right. we really werent great at being guys, but you know why? because were girls.

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i really liked that fighter pilot one.

MONICA:
 oh, candy! she was so spunky! 

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 oh, chantal!

RACHEL:
 oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! i mean when i stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 i know what it did! nothing.

MONICA:
 they wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something! how can you not care?

JOEY:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 so what are you doing bringing her here?! theres people here!

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

ROSS:

ROSS:

 cheers!

ROSS:
 cheers!  the brits both crush their cans, and not to be out done, ross crushes his coffee cup,  

 oh boy, i just love to sing!

CHANDLER:
 yes, i-i know that you do, but i think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing old man river.

 oh, look at us! who wouldve thought that cupid had a station at 14th street nails. 

CHANDLER:
  serious relationship

 i know! and im just getting out of a marriage, i mean talk about meant to be!

CHANDLER:
 but i do know that its some time tomorrow.  

MONICA:
 done?

PHOEBE:
 yep!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hey! whats up?

MONICA:
 this switch thing has been driving me crazy. so i turned it off and checked every outlet. now, four of them dont work. which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. so, i plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.

MONICA:
 yeah, well, im using noise. okay. all right! so, is everybody ready? here we go.  something! where is it? 

RACHEL:
 its coming from joey!

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, thats so freaky! turn him off!!  

PHOEBE:
 ooh, hey, could we put on the news? i think it might be raining.

ROSS:
 oh, just hold on a second. im watching this rugby thing on espn. i dont know what the big deal is. im man enough to play this sport.

JOEY:
 dude, youre not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.

 

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack.

 ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. did you?

CHANDLER:
 well, i-i thought i did but, i-i guess i did not!

JOEY:
 hey-hey, whats going on?

CHANDLER:
 oh, im packing. yknow im-im packing cause im moving to yemen tomorrow.

JOEY:
 thanks for telling me! 

CHANDLER:
 im only going to pretend im moving to yemen, its the only way i can get rid off her.

JOEY:
 ohhhh, good one! and yemen that actually sounds like a real country.

  to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. its a real space saver.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i know, i do that cause it makes me look taller.

 okay, chandler, come on!

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 nope.  youd play rugby. i mean look how brutal this is!

ROSS:
 hey, i can handle it! all right?

RACHEL:
 please, ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.

ROSS:
 thats cause-cause youre moms dog kept-kept looking at me.

JOEY:
  thats called a scrum, okay? its kinda like a huddle.

ROSS:
 and is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?

JOEY:
 ross! 

PHOEBE:
 well, why are you doing this anyway?

ROSS:
 well, you shouldve seen the guy that she used to go out with. i mean, hes like joe rugby.

PHOEBE:
 youre kidding! and he plays rugby?! thats so funny. 

ROSS:
 anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. so im gonna show her how tough i really am!

RACHEL:
  youre right, you are a tough guy. youre the toughest palaeontologist i know.

JOEY:
 all right, come on look, ross can take care of himself! its not like heschandler!

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 look, dont worry about me. okay? ill just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. ill uh, ill be that guy right out of the circle. 

 oh!

RACHEL:
 oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin at him.  commercial break  

JOEY:
 ross-ross-ross-ross! stay away from that guy  

ROSS:
 they dont look any bigger than me!

JOEY:
 well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. so you look bigger to you from where you are.

 im just going to say hi to the lads. all right?

ROSS:
 all right.

 okay.  

PHOEBE:
  

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 he asked you out?!

RACHEL:
 no. but i was showing him some cufflinks and i felt his pulse.

MONICA:
 saucy!

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 electrical plans for the building.

RACHEL:
 okay, okay, okay should i be scared?

MONICA:
 i know that switch does something, okay? so-so i went down to city hall and got these. all i had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.

RACHEL:
 wow! if only more people knew.  

CHANDLER:
 yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.

 oh please. every moment is precious. yknow? besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.

CHANDLER:
 well, were really not that close.  is uh, good-bye then.

 on no! no! its not good-bye, im not leaving until you get on that plane.

CHANDLER:
 okay. then i guess its just, wait here then.   

 one ticket to yemen?

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no, no. no, no, no, i just, i just need a pretend ticket.

 im sorry sir, i dont understand. 

CHANDLER:
 what would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?

 are you travelling with a child?

CHANDLER:
 no. all right, yknow what, shes  think that im handing you a credit card, but what im really gonna do is hand you a library card.

 ah, sir a ticket to yemen is $2,100 and we dont take library cards.

 whats the matter? is something wrong? do you have to stay?

CHANDLER:
  

 i cant believe theyre doing that to him! i told them to go easy on him!

PHOEBE:
 no offence but, yknow sometimes its hard to understand you, yknow with the accent, so 

 thats just halftime, theres more of this. 

ROSS:
 did you see me? i was pretty good, huh? that is one fun game!

 right.

ROSS:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 shes right! you have to stop!

ROSS:
 what? no! no, im not stopping. im red ross!

JOEY:
 dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be dead ross!

ROSS:
 i dont care! i am not quitting! i insist on finishing this game!

 all right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.

ROSS:
 no, god no! that is no place for a woman. those guys will grab anything.

 no. thats not what im saying. i just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.

ROSS:
 i like that.

 yeah? listen closely, devon has got a weak ankle. 

ROSS:
 huh?

 one swift kick and hell back off.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 i dont care! the wires have come loose in your head!

MONICA:
 i just thought that if i could follow the wire i could find out what it did.

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 no. it disappears back there behind that baseboard. for a minute there, i thought it went downstairs. 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

 my uncle dragged us there. but, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.

ROSS:
 yeah.

 they were so ornate and beautiful, i mean look at that!  

MONICA:
 i dont know how museums work in england but, here, youre not supposed to take stuff.

 i uh, i got it from the gift shop. they have really lax security there. 

ROSS:

MONICA:
 oh no, two days, you must be bummed.

ROSS:

JOEY:
 hey thats what all my relationships are like.

CHANDLER:
 yes, but in rosss case, they both know in two weeks thats it. 

ROSS:
 pheebs!

 hey!

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
  totally craving meat. this afternoon i tried tricking it, i made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, yknow? and i got nauseous.

CHANDLER:
 maybe thats because soy-burgers suck!

PHOEBE:
 being pregnant is tough on your tummy.

JOEY:
 hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.

PHOEBE:
 thats sweat. you throw up all morning, youll have that glow too. 

 

RACHEL:
 oh, heres that trench-coat that you wanted.

 oh great! 

RACHEL:
 yeah?

 man, i could really flash somebody in this thing.  

RACHEL:
  hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.

 why not?!

RACHEL:
 well, thats because of a lot of 

 yknow, they ruin it for everybody.

RACHEL:
 i know!

 yknow, i wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.

RACHEL:
 oh?

 yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.

RACHEL:
 well, congratulations, so do you love her?

 no, no, no, shes nice but, yknow, it just it made me realize that im just not, im just not ready to be dating, yknow?

RACHEL:
 huh. well, uh, thats uh, thats interesting.  

 

RACHEL:
 oh, its just an anti-theft device.

 then uh, whats-whats this?  

RACHEL:
 you need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.   

RACHEL:
 oops, sorry. listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.

CHANDLER:
 what are you talking about?

JOEY:
 yeah, what going on?

RACHEL:
 we have to have a surprise bon voyage party for emily. but its actually for joshua.  date, so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside of work, and now i have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! 

ROSS:
 well, as much as id like to meet josh and warn him, emily and i arent going to be here. all right? i mean, shes going to come by first to say good-bye, and then ive got a whole special evening planned. so im sorry, no party.

JOEY:
 awwww!

 

RACHEL:
 surprise!!! 

 surprise!! 

 no ones ever thrown me a surprise party before!

RACHEL:
 well, it was all rosss idea.

 youre so sweet! and im so surprised!

ROSS:
 you really didnt know?  

CHANDLER:
 why are you in here if joshua is all the way over there?  

RACHEL:
 uhh, because im trying to play hard to get. oh, quick hes looking over here, say something funny.

CHANDLER:
 like what? 

JOEY:
 what-what-what is so funny?

CHANDLER:
 i said, "like what?"

JOEY:
 now thats a thinker.

RACHEL:
 okay, yknow what, yknow what? this playing hard to get thing is not working. umm, hand-hand me those cherries.   hi!

 hi!

RACHEL:
 care for a cherry?

 oh, no thanks.

RACHEL:
 no? yknow, i can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.  

 you okay?   you all right? 

ROSS:
 

 oh, but the partys only just getting started!

ROSS:
 yeah, but we-we have to be at the four seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then yknow, then the plaza for dinner.

 so why did you plan a party at the same time?

ROSS:
 no-no-no, no, umm, actually american surprise parties are-are-are very short. its usually, "surprise!" and then, "oh my god, im so surprisedgood-bye!"

 but ross, im such having a great time! your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.

ROSS:
 monica said that did she?   

PHOEBE:
 ooh, yeah. then what are you going to put on top of that?

JOEY:
 a little salami. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh yeah! then umm, what goes on top of the salami?

JOEY:
 pastrami. 

PHOEBE:
 oooh, yeah. youre a genius. 

RACHEL:
 oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?

JOEY:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 up!

MONICA:
 you changed?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i did. i needed my lucky dress.

MONICA:
 and lucky means, more cleavage? 

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 ohh, god! look at him, hes so cute. i wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! how can i kiss him and not letting him know that i like him?

JOEY:
 oh! i know how you can get him, take off your bra.

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 there was a seen in footloose...

CHANDLER:
 flashdance.

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl

CHANDLER:
 she was a welder.

JOEY:
 what? were you like in the movie, or anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. very sexy, and classy.

MONICA:
 or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.

RACHEL:
 its not christmas!

MONICA:
 or spin the bottle?

RACHEL:
 hes not 11!

  this. it was really so thoughtful of you.

RACHEL:
 what? youre leaving?!

ROSS:
 yes, we have something we have to get to.

 uhh, yeah, i think im going to take-off too.

RACHEL:
 no! you guys cant leave yet! you have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!

ROSS:
 what big thing?  

RACHEL:
  bottle, it lands on gunther, so i would have to kiss gunther.  gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on gunthers face and decides  all right. who wants to go first?

 ill go.

 yay! 

JOEY:
 welcome to america.  

MONICA:
 two in a row! youve got to use your tongues now!  

RACHEL:
 yay! emily!  

CHANDLER:
 what are the odds? what are the odds? 

ROSS:
  lets let someone else play.

JOEY:
 if you didnt want to play, why did you come to the party?

RACHEL:
 okay, my turn!!   rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!! the baby just kicked!

 ohh!

RACHEL:
 its okay! its okay! it kicked once, itll kick again!

 oh my god!  

RACHEL:
 all right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.   

RACHEL:
 just a bug. commercial break  

PHOEBE:
 yknow it doesnt matter how much im craving it. yknow why im never gonna eat meat? because its murder, cold blooded murder.

CHANDLER:
 okay.   

CHANDLER:
 theres a phoebe on my sandwich!  

JOEY:
 phoebe, what-what are you doing?!

PHOEBE:
 i cant help it. i need the meat. the baby needs the meat.

JOEY:
 all right look, yknow how-yknow how when youre dating someone and you dont want to cheat on them, unless its with someone really hot?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, totally!

JOEY:
 all right. okay. well this is the same kind of deal. if youre going to do something wrong,  

JOEY:
 feel better now?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but at what cost? six more months, three meals a day, im gonna eat like, yknow millions of cows.

JOEY:
 hey, what if i said, i could even things out for ya, meatwise.

PHOEBE:
 what?

JOEY:
 well, i eat a lot of meat right?

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 well, suppose until the babys born i laid off it. no extra animals would die, you-youd just be eating my animals.

PHOEBE:
 joey, i cant believe you would do that for me.

JOEY:
 absolutely! i could be a vegetarian. theres no meat in beer, right? 

ROSS:
 okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.  

 but, we cant go now. it looks like rachels gonna put on a skit.

MONICA:
 oh my god! have you lost your mind?

RACHEL:
 no-n-n-n-no! i am finally thinking clearly. my lucky dress wasnt working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.

MONICA:
 rachel-rachel-rachel i-i cannot, i cant let i kinda want to see what happens.

 hey!

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 i think youre done.

JOEY:

 umm, that was really great, but i-i gotta take-off actually.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 oh no-no-no! no, i got this all under control.

 you really dont seem like you do. thats  

RACHEL:
 ughhhh!! forget it!  how this is supposed to happen.

 well, what was supposed to happen?

RACHEL:
 can you not look at me when i say this?  if i could get you here, i could seduce you.

 huh. oh, boy!  work, and i bought six of them from you.

RACHEL:
 well, im sorry, i thought you needed them!

 no, no-no, no-no, my point is that i kept coming back because, i wanted to see you.

RACHEL:
 why?!

 because i-i like you.

RACHEL:
 you like me?

 yeah! i mean youre-youre beautiful and smart and sophisticateda lot of this isnt based on tonight.

RACHEL:
 yeah but-but-but you liked me! oh my god, i cant believe this, all this time, i liked you and you liked me!

 but

RACHEL:
 oh no-no-no dont say but! no-no, buts never good! lets just leave it at, you like me and i like you.

 okay uh, however

RACHEL:
 oh, now see thats a fancy but.

 my marriage like just ended, and im really not ready to get into anything yet.

RACHEL:
 but.

 im sorry, i, i just need a little time.

RACHEL:
 okay.  

RACHEL:
 ohh, here you are. i was looking for you before. joshuas gone so you and emily are free to go.

ROSS:
 thats okay. shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things i had planned, so

RACHEL:
 oh, ross, im sorry. i completely ruined your evening.

ROSS:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 well, if it makes you feel any better, i made a fool out of myself.

ROSS:
 helps a little.

RACHEL:
 is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?

ROSS:
 yeah, have a seat.

RACHEL:
 im so sorry.

ROSS:
 thats okay, i mean it was just two-week thing anyway, i just didnt want it to end this way, yknow?

RACHEL:
 well, maybe you didnt want it to end?

ROSS:
 what do you mean?

RACHEL:
 you seem to really like her.

ROSS:
 yeah, i really do. yeah, but what am i gonna do, i mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yknow no commitment.

RACHEL:
 ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through monicas photo albums, i mean you dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.

ROSS:
 you think?

RACHEL:
 yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

ROSS:
 hey, youre right.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 thanks. 

RACHEL:
 i dont know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.

ROSS:
 oh my god! those werent albino kids, that was computer camp! rach! 

RACHEL:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 youre a pathetic loser, right?

CHANDLER:
 oh-ho, yeah!

RACHEL:
 sit! 

 hi. 

RACHEL:
 oh my gosh, joshua!

 all those things i said about not being ready

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
  the baby due?

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 ugh. now if a cow should die of natural causes, i can have one of those right?

 ohhh, man!!

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 treegers snaking the shower drain.

 what in the name of hell?

JOEY:
 maybe he found you flip-flop. 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 whoa! is this porn? what did i do? i mustve hit something on the remote.

CHANDLER:
 do we pay for this?

JOEY:
 no, we didnt even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they punish us.

CHANDLER:
 maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex.

JOEY:
 maybe we shouldnt pay our gas bill?  

  of naked.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!

 yeah, it happened to me once. i was just flipping through the channels and bam! it was like finding money.

CHANDLER:
 like finding money with naked people on it!

 then i made the mistake of turning off the tv, i never got it back again. and im sad. 

JOEY:
  opening credits  still on, there are three women getting ready to shave the chest of some guy. joey and chandler are wondering why that guy is letting them shave his chest, and monica and rachel 

RACHEL:
 all right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?  

 

CHANDLER:
 we dont know what could make this go away.

JOEY:
 yeah, so no one touches the remote. and no one touches the tv!

CHANDLER:
 and no one touches the air around the tv!

JOEY:
 imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?

MONICA:
 well at least, im going to mute it. 

 oh no-no-no!  

CHANDLER:
 we still have porn.

JOEY:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 honey, what are you doing? thats too heavy.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 give it here.  

MONICA:
 okay.

PHOEBE:
 ohh, im getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. yknow, i have to find a job where i carrying a smaller table.  

CHANDLER:
 or a job where you dont have to carry a table.

PHOEBE:
 you mean like a doctor?

JOEY:
 pheebs! youre blocking the porn! look out!

PHOEBE:
 ohh!  today. 

ROSS:
 hi.

MONICA:
 hi.

ROSS:
 so uh, emily just went to the airport.

MONICA:
 oh. why didnt you take her?

ROSS:
 eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. and yknow, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so

MONICA:
 you must feel horrible. hey! the guys have free porn!

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 hey, cheer up! youre gonna see her again, right?

ROSS:
 well i, thats the thing, i dont know! i mean, whenever i brought it up with her she said,  we have to talk about the future? lets just enjoy"

MONICA:
  youve got to see her again.

ROSS:
 and why do you care so much?

MONICA:
 because! you could get to live out my fantasy!

ROSS:
 you had fantasies about emily?

MONICA:
 no! yknow, the fantasy! meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.

ROSS:
 is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that ukrainian kid?

MONICA:
 yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!

ROSS:
 ahh.

MONICA:
 do you love her?

ROSS:
 we said it was only going to be two weeks, yknow?

MONICA:
 you love her!

ROSS:
 what-what is love really?

MONICA:
 ohhh, i knew you loved her! then you need to go to the airport and tell her. youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go to the gate. youre gonna call out her name and say, "i love you!" and shes gonna say, "i love you, too!" and you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.

ROSS:
 i am a good kisser.

MONICA:
 then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in  too much porn.  

RACHEL:
 is that the heartbeat?

 thats it.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!

RACHEL:
 oh wow! this is so cool. 

 have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?

PHOEBE:
 why dont take care of this one, and should i get pregnant again, ill hold onto your card, okay?

 no, im getting three separate heartbeats.

PHOEBE:
 three? you guys were worried i wouldnt even have one!

 doctors are wrong all the time.

PHOEBE:
 well, yeah.

RACHEL:
 well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!

 definitely. 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!! so i-i mean so in a few months im going to have three full grown babies just walkin around inside me?! oh! oh! and its gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!

 actually, giving birth to three babies isnt that different from giving birth to one.

PHOEBE:
 what do you know?! 

 

PHOEBE:
 ooh! hi!

 hi!  the doctors?

PHOEBE:
 oh well, okay, hey, yknow how when youre umm, youre walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "oh, thats nice?"

 yes.

PHOEBE:
 okay, yeah well, good news, youre going to have three babies.

 three babies?

 i finally got my band!

 were gonna have a big family, ive always wanted a big family!

PHOEBE:
 oh god, im so glad you guys are happy, i was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.

 why would we be freaked?

PHOEBE:
 no, no maybe cause its harder to raise them, and the added expense, and

 

 right.

PHOEBE:
 no, back to happy. back to happy!

 no-no-no, no, its going to be fine. because umm, because i teach home ec, and uh, i can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. yknow itll-itll be like my very own little sweatshop. 

 yeah, ive been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.

 no, frank.

PHOEBE:
 no you cant quit college! no! youre in college? really?

 yeah, refrigerator college.

 yeah.

 yeah, yknow when we found out we were going to have a baby, yknow i figured yknow like i should yknow have like a careerand i love refrigerators!

PHOEBE:
 you cant give up on your dream.

 no, its okay. were-were gonna have three kids! and thats-thats a different kind of dream. three kids and no money.  

 

ROSS:
 emily! 

 oh my god! what are you doing here? 

ROSS:
 i just, i had to see you one more time before you took-off.

 you are so sweet. 

ROSS:
 thats, thats, thats a big candy bar.   i had the most amazing time with you.

 me too. 

 this is the final boarding call for flight 009.

 well, that me.   im only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.  

ROSS:
  ive been thinking, im just gonna come out and say it. okay? i-i-i ah, i-i think i love you.

 oh. 

ROSS:
 thats no problem. commercial break  

RACHEL:
 whats that song? it has been in my head all day long.

CHANDLER:
 its the theme from good will humping.

RACHEL:
 yknow who doesnt even like dirty movies? my new boyfriend joshua.

JOEY:
 yeah right.

RACHEL:
 no, he told me. he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.

CHANDLER:
 oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?

RACHEL:
 yes!

JOEY:
 yeah, he likes porn. 

MONICA:
 where ya going?

RACHEL:
 im going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. 

PHOEBE:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey!

MONICA:
 how did it go with frank and alice?

PHOEBE:
 well, frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! i need to make a lot of money really fast, and i had an idea that i want to talk to you  okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.

CHANDLER:
 they dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff. i can get you some free white out though. 

MONICA:
 ohh! did you do what i said? did-did-did you tell her?

ROSS:
 i did.

MONICA:
 and well, what did she say?

ROSS:
 thank you.

MONICA:
 oh, youre totally welcome! whatd she say?

ROSS:
 she said, "thank you." i said, "i love you." and she said, "thank you."

CHANDLER:
 whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?

JOEY:
 yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!

ROSS:
 what do i do now?

JOEY:
 you play hard to get.

ROSS:
 she already lives in london.

JOEY:
 then you go to tokyo.

CHANDLER:
 all right look, forget it, forget it. you told her you love her, its over.

MONICA:
 it is not over! youre over!

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 you know!

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. and the reason why she couldnt, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! come on now go! go! 

ROSS:
 okay! okay! but if she doesnt call, it is definitely over! no, wait. wait. unless, eventually, i call her, yknow just to she whats going on, and, and she says shell call me back, but then she doesnt. then its over. 

JOEY:
 way to be strong, man!   

RACHEL:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hi! listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? we need a porn break. we spent the last two hours watching in & out & in, again.

RACHEL:
 well, so, why dont you just turn it off?

CHANDLER:
 because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 well, what-what cha got there?

PHOEBE:
 oh this, well im glad you asked.   now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?  thinking

CHANDLER:
 pregnant woman slays four?

MONICA:
 phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?

PHOEBE:
 no!

MONICA:
 are you sure?

PHOEBE:
 no!

RACHEL:
 honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help frank and alice just by selling knives.

PHOEBE:
 no-no, i know that, but i just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.

CHANDLER:
 whats the second part of your plan?

PHOEBE:
 my saturn dealership.  

ROSS:
 

 ross.

ROSS:
 emily, hi! uh, how-how was you flight?

 it was dreadful. i felt terrible about how i acted when you said those wonderful things.

ROSS:
 no, no, that-that, thats all right. umm, im just glad you called.

 ross umm, theres something that ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.

ROSS:
 does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america?  

ROSS:
 she doesnt know which one of us she wants, me or this colin guy.

MONICA:
 this isnt how its supposed to go, there cant be another guy.

ROSS:
 well

MONICA:
 of course theres another guy!! this is even more perfect! now you have to prove your love!

ROSS:
 im not proving anything. okay, im done listening to you. if i hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, i never wouldve put my fist through the wall!

CHANDLER:
 you put your fist through the wall?

ROSS:
 no, i missed and hit the door. but, it opened really hard!

MONICA:
 you have to go to london!

ROSS:
 what?

MONICA:
 yeah, you have to go fight for her!

JOEY:
 oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. yeah. cause you already told her you love her and she didnt say it back, then she called you and told you that theres another guy, so yeah, go to london thatll scare her!

MONICA:
 when rachel was with paulo, what did you do?

ROSS:
 i made fun of his accent.

MONICA:
 you sat back and let him have her, you didnt fight at all. am i right? do you want the same thing to happen with emily?

ROSS:
 no.

MONICA:
 all right then, go fight for her! go to london! i mean, that could be you and emily! 

ROSS:
 really?

MONICA:
 come on! surprise her! show up at her doorstep! dont let her go without a fight!

ROSS:
 all right. all right, im gonna do it! 

MONICA:
 all right.

ROSS:
 im gonna, im gonna go to london and im going to fight for her.

MONICA:
 okay, good luck! 

JOEY:
 ross! ross! if youre going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those toblerone bars?   

RACHEL:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 ooh-ooh! i did it! i did it! i figured out a way to make money! im gonna open up my own massage place and franks gonna help me! and! we can work it around his schedule so he doesnt have to quit school!

MONICA:
 thats sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?

RACHEL:
 well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised

PHOEBE:
 im telling it! im telling it!

RACHEL:
 okay.

PHOEBE:
 okay. you know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so i just figured we could combine the two, okay, i give the massages and frank drives! i can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what ive got?

CHANDLER:
 a place where no one will ever get out alive?

PHOEBE:
 no! think about it, its a taxi that people take when they need to relax, its

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 the name was my favourite part!

RACHEL:
 well, well i can up with it!

PHOEBE:
 you did not!!!! oh! no! you came up with relaxi cab! thats not good.

RACHEL:
 well, i 

MONICA:
 hello.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 oh my god! ross, are you in england? was emily surprised? 

ROSS:
 no, because she hasnt come home yet. and she hasnt been home all night! shes obviously staying with that other guy, and im the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!

MONICA:
 all right. when is, when is the next flight out?

ROSS:
 about four hours.

MONICA:
 okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnt show up by then, then just come on home.

PHOEBE:
 hey, tell him about relaxi-taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks thats better than relaxi cab.

RACHEL:
 okay, its not relaxi cab. its relaxicab, like taxicab. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, that is better.  

CHANDLER:
 are we in london?

MONICA:
 what are you doing here? you cant be here!

 ive uh, ive come to talk to ross.  

 what?

JOEY:
 

 i was going to call him, but

MONICA:
 oh, you came to tell him you love him! i knew it!  was right! 

 id really rather talk to him. 

MONICA:
 oh.

 i uh, ive been to his apartment and he wasnt there, and uh. i need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?  emilys phone ring with amazing clarity. apparently, sound travels quite easily through the walls of british buildings. anyhoo, ross looks around for the ringing phone and in the meantime emilys answering machine picks up and once again with 

 ross, are you there? ross, i dont know if you can hear this but  gonna talk anyway, uh, im in the states with you sister and your friends and its all over with colin. i came here to tell you that, and to tell youyes, joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! uh, i came here to tell you that i love you.

ROSS:
   i love you too! im, im gonna call you right now from the phone booth! 

 i wish i could know if youd heard any of that. i suppose ive either just told you i love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. mrs. newman if youre listening, bugger off this in none of your business. i suppose theres not much chance you did heard that, and theres the call waiting so, i should go. oh well. 

ROSS:
 hi.

 ross, i love you!

ROSS:
 ohh! thank you. closing credits  

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 hey! wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.

PHOEBE:
  im so pregnant that imy guitar doesnt fit anymore. so i thought til im not, im just gonna play all my songs on this drum. it sounds really cool!

CHANDLER:
 all right.

PHOEBE:
 listen. listen.  cat, what are they feeding you?  

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

 umm, actually, i came down to ask you a big favour.

PHOEBE:
 oh, well, dont tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.

  baby leslie, and frank wants to name one of the boy babies frank jr. jr. 

CHANDLER:
 wouldnt that be frank the iii?

 dont get me started.  babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.

PHOEBE:
 wow! thats so great! oh! oh! cougar.

 you think about it.  opening credits 

 i left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised? 

ROSS:
 hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.

 

ROSS:
 oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? twice?

 well thats ambitious. 

ROSS:
 hey, uh, you can ignore that.

 thats carol with your son!

ROSS:
 uhh, believe me when hes older, hell understand.

 

ROSS:
 ill be right there.    carol and susan.

 hey, its so nice to finally meet you!

 me too!

 ohh, yknow, susans gonna be shooting a commercial in london next week.

 oh yeah, im so excited, ive never been there.

 oh, well, ill show you around.

 that would be great! also, uh, i was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions

 oh, theres tonnes of terrific stuffill go with you!

 ahh! 

ROSS:
 look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so

 are you all right?

 oh, hes fine. hes fine. its just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesnt like me.

ROSS:
 oh come on! thats-thats true.  

PHOEBE:
 hi!

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey! do we have a baby name yet?

PHOEBE:
 ugh! no! this is so hard! i went through this whole book   and found nothing! i want a name thats really like, yknow strong and confident, yknow? like-like exxon. 

CHANDLER:
 well, it certainly worked for that valdez kid.

JOEY:
 ooh-ooh, pheebs, you want a strong name? how about, the hulk?

PHOEBE:
 no, im-im not sure about hulk, but i like the idea of a name starting with "the."

JOEY:
 oh, want a good name, go with joey. joeys your pal. joeys your buddy. "where is everybody?" "well, theyre hanging out with joey."

CHANDLER:
 hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him joey, you should name him chandler.  come on! chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.

JOEY:
 oh well, hey, joeys loveable too! but the thing about joey is, if you need him, hell be there.

CHANDLER:
 well, chandler will be there for you too. i mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there. and hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.

JOEY:
 what do ya say? what do ya say?

PHOEBE:
 well, i, i like the idea of naming him after someone i love, and joey and chandler are great names.  dontmaybe ill just name him the hulk.

JOEY:
 i knew i shouldnt have mentioned it! thats what i wanted to name my kid!  

RACHEL:
 hey, mon, if you were hoping to sleep with joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.  

MONICA:
 yknow what? it really creeps me out choosing other peoples sex clothes.

RACHEL:
 sorry. im so exited! ive been waiting for this for months! i got my hair coloured! i got new sheets! im making him a very fancy meal. 

MONICA:
 um-hmm.

RACHEL:
 what am i making him by the way?

MONICA:
 well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.

RACHEL:
 i thought i was making him filet mignon? 

MONICA:
 yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. and then you realised if you  then you  make your famous baked potato and diet coke.

RACHEL:
 wow, i really get crabby when i cook.  

ROSS:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

ROSS:
 so uh, emily called last night

CHANDLER:
 and now youre giving me the message!

ROSS:
 turns out them emily is just crazy about susan. yeah, theyre going to the theatre together! theyre going to dinner! theyre going horseback riding!

PHOEBE:
 god, susan is so fun!

ROSS:
 look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? for like, for like six

 "my friend susan is so smart. my friend susan is so funny. my friend susan is so great."

CHANDLER:
 you actually think that something can happen between emily and susan?

ROSS:
 hey, theyre going to the gym together! two women! stretching! yknow they-they take a steam together! things get a little playfuldidnt you see personal best?

JOEY:
 no, but im gonna!

CHANDLER:
 hi! hi! youre crazy! okay? this is emily. emily is straight.

ROSS:
 how do you know? i mean we thought carol was straight before i married her!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i definitely. i dont like the name ross.

ROSS:
 what a weird way to kick me when im down.

PHOEBE:
 no! no! i-i meant for the baby!

ROSS:
 oh. whats wrong with ross?

PHOEBE:
 well, its just yknow that something like this would never to like the hulk, yknow

ROSS:
 actually that-thats not true, in the incredible hulk uh, no. 72, dr. bruce banner found  ugh, nevermind, my girlfriends a lesbian. 

PHOEBE:
 so, i decided im definitely going to go with either joey or chandler.

JOEY:
 oh! oh-oh, you gotta pick joey! i mean, name one famous person named chandler.

CHANDLER:
 raymond chandler.

JOEY:
 someone you didnt make up!

CHANDLER:
 okay, there are no famous joeys. except for, huh, joey buttafucco.

JOEY:
 yeah, that guy really hurt us.

PHOEBE:
 well, how about a compromise then, okay? what if its like yknow, chanoey?

CHANDLER:
 okay, look, joey! come on, think about it, first of all, hell never be president. theres never gonna be a president joey.

JOEY:
 all right look man, i didnt want to bring this up, but chandler, is the stupidest name i ever heard in my life! its not even a name; its barely even a word. okay? its kinda like chandelier, but its not! all right? its a stupid, stupid non-name!

CHANDLER:
 wow, youre, youre right. i have a horrible, horrible name.

JOEY:
 im sorry man, i didntim-im sorry. im sorry. 

CHANDLER:
 okay.

JOEY:
 so i guess its joey then!  

 this is so nice. thank you for doing this.

RACHEL:
 ohh, please! cooking soothes me. 

 great! oh, it all looks sooo good!

RACHEL:
 

 oh my god!

RACHEL:
 oh i know, my god, this is sothis rice is soi am so good.

 behind you?

RACHEL:
  live here; sometimes they migrate back over.

  they can not be here. its just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!

RACHEL:
 yeah, sure, okay. okay.  

JOEY:
   

RACHEL:
 all gone! so, farm birds, huh?

 yeah, its-its my only weird thing, i swear. and i-i-i wouldve told you about it, but i didnt know they would be here.

RACHEL:
 oh.

 so, all right. 

RACHEL:
 okay. so, can i serve you a little ofwhat? what? what?  

 nothing i uh, its just that i know that theyre still out there.

RACHEL:
 but, theyre across the hall! i mean thats two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.

 okay, thats-thats not funny. uhh.

RACHEL:
 okay, yknow, would you feel better if we went someplace else? i mean we could pack all this stuff up and yknow go to your apartment.

 oh, theyre working on this week, its a total mess. but uh, im staying at my parents house, we could go there.

RACHEL:
 your parents?

 yeah, theyre out of town.

RACHEL:
 ohh.

 yeah-yeah, its this huge place, and-and its got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. what do you say?

RACHEL:
 yeah that works. 

 they-they-they can smell fear. 

ROSS:
 

 hey! hows ben?

ROSS:
 well, i asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "no." i asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "no." i asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "no." so, hes sweeping.  

 hey, ben! hey!

ROSS:
 so umm, any word from susan?

 ooh, yeah! she said shes having sooo much fun with emily.

ROSS:
 uh-huh. uh-huh. uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, i dont know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?

 whats too much fun?

ROSS:
 yknow, the kind of fun, you and susan had when we were married.

 oh my god, you are so paranoid! 

ROSS:
 am i?!

 yes!

ROSS:
 am i?!

 i cant speak for emily, but susan is in a loving, committed relationship.

ROSS:
 uh-huh, carol, so were we. all right, just-just imagine for a moment, susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. yknow? say-say theyre coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, theyre laughing, yknow, someone innocently touches someone else theres electricity, its new. its exciting. are you telling me there isnt even the slightest possibility of something happening?

 maybe.

ROSS:
 oh my god!! i didnt really believe it until you just said it!! 

 and even though none of the other kids believed me, i swear to god, that duck pushed me!

RACHEL:
 wow! this place is fabulous!

 yeah, yeah, let me show you around. this is the uh, downstairs living room.

RACHEL:
 whoa-whoa, theres two living rooms? god, growing up here, this place mustve been a real babe magnet.

 yeah, well, it wouldve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.

RACHEL:
 ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. wanna make out? 

 hey, heres an idea. why dont uh, i put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?

RACHEL:
 that sounds like a plan. umm, is there a place i can go freshen up?

 oh yeah, yeah uh, its down the hall and uh, second door to your left.

RACHEL:
 ah. 

 oh, hi, darling!

 mom, dad, what are you guys doing here?

 oh, well we cut the trip short.

 france sucks!

 umm, this may be a little weird, but i-i-i got a date here.

 oh, say no more!

 well just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and well be right out of you hair.

 oh, that-that would be great. so you didnt even get to italy?

 yep, sucks!  removed her dress and is wearing nothing but a lace nightie. she tries to find someplace seductive to wait for joshua. she tries to sit on the piano, but it makes too much noise. so she goes over to the couch and kinda half lays down to wait for joshua. joshua comes in 

RACHEL:
 hi you!

 oh my god!

RACHEL:
 i know, i can do more than cook. 

 i like her. she sees smart. commercial break 

 uhh, rachel, my parents

RACHEL:
 ohh! its so nice to meet you.   hello. 

 hi.

RACHEL:
 hello.

 hello. well, joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

RACHEL:
 what? this-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is notthats-thats not what it is. see, see, okay, i work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. its-its, theyre-theyre wearing it in milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then i see how people respond, and then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdales, so and obviously in uh, in-in this case,  back, "usa not ready."

 maybe in l.a?

RACHEL:
 yes!

 there you go.

 so, have you kids eaten yet?

RACHEL:
 well, we were going to do that afteri mean umm, next.

 well, were starving, why dont we all go get something to eat?

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah, well yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin around the house. 

 so we go eat.

RACHEL:
 yes.

 youll wear that. well be eating, and of course, youll be wearing that.  

JOEY:
 dude, i am sorry about what i said!

CHANDLER:
 no, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!

JOEY:
 its not that bad.

CHANDLER:
 yes it is! from now on, i have no first name.

JOEY:
 so, youre just bing?

CHANDLER:
 i have no name.

PHOEBE:
 all right, so, what are we supposed to call you?

CHANDLER:
 okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, clint.

JOEY:
 no way are you cool enough to pull of clint.

CHANDLER:
 okay, so what name am i cool enough to pull off?

PHOEBE:
 umm, gene.

CHANDLER:
 its clint. its clint! 

JOEY:
 see you later, gene.

PHOEBE:
 bye, gene.

CHANDLER:
 its clint! clint!

JOEY:
 whats up with gene? 

MONICA:
 so, you wore your nightie to dinner?

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah. and uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, i jumped up, and my boob popped out.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!

MONICA:
 oh, no!

RACHEL:
 no, its all right. i got nice boobs.  

ROSS:
  and susan are going to a poetry reading together! 

RACHEL:
 so?

ROSS:
 so! poetry? susans gay! theyre being gay together!

MONICA:
 emilys straight.

ROSS:
 oh, wake up!

PHOEBE:
 wow, carol really messed you up!

ROSS:
 excuse me?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  but the rest is right.

ROSS:
 look, i dont know what youre talking about, i am not a crazy, jealous person.

RACHEL:
 huh.

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 shes totally right! when we were together, you got all freaked out about mark and there was nothing going on.

MONICA:
 this totally makes sense!

ROSS:
 it does not!

MONICA:
 oh, sure it does! in high school, you werent jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!

PHOEBE:
 all right, all right, so up until 92-93 he was very trusting, then 94 hit, carol left him and bamn! paranoid city!

RACHEL:
 absolutely! absolutely!

MONICA:
 this is so much fun!

ROSS:
 this is not fun!

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 youre actually going through with this?

CHANDLER:
 hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why i never do well with women so, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, im either gonna be mark johnson or john markson.

PHOEBE:
 you got problems because of you! not your name! all right, this has got to stop! chandler is a great name! in factyes,  know you really wanted me to name the baby joey, but eh, so, im-im, im gonna, im gonna name the baby chandler.

ROSS:
 i just, i hate this so much! i mean, every time i go pick her up at the airport, its-its so great. but at the same time im thinking, "well, im gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."

CHANDLER:
 so what are you going to do?

ROSS:
 nothing! theres nothing to do! i mean, she lives there, i live here. i mean, she-shed have to uh, move here. she should move here!

JOEY:
 what?

ROSS:
 i could ask her to live with me!

CHANDLER:
 are you serious?

ROSS:
 i mean, why not! i mean, i mean why not?!

CHANDLER:
 because youve only known her for six weeks! okay, ive got a carton of milk in my fridge ive had a longer relationship with!

ROSS:
 look guys, when im with her its-its-its like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. i mean i-i-i love her, yknow?

CHANDLER:
 and i love the milk! but, im not gonna some british girl to move in with me! 

JOEY:
 all right look, ross, hes right. emilys great, shes great! but this way too soon, youre only gonna scare her!

ROSS:

ROSS:
 yeah, no, youre right, i know, youre right, im not, im not gonna do it. all right, thanks guys. 

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 yes! didnt you ever read sports illustrated?! no! i didnt read yours! but come on, we can go to the game tonight!

CHANDLER:
 look, the only way i will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.

JOEY:
 its the knicks!

CHANDLER:
 screw the knicks!

JOEY:
 whoa!

CHANDLER:
 i didnt mean that. i just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.

JOEY:

JOEY:
 yeah, the knicks rule all!

PHOEBE:
 hey, so? are you gonna do it?

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 what?

RACHEL:
 come on! they rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! i mean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what? a year? and somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off. im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i dont dance at weddings.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 oh, howd that happen?

CHANDLER:
 because im cooler.

MONICA:
 no, seriously.

CHANDLER:
 well shes, shes the kinda girljoey was unconscious.  

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh, how did it go?

RACHEL:
 well, i did my best to convince him that im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedim just going through a hard time.

PHOEBE:
 what did he say?

RACHEL:
 well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. ugh. i feel blue.

MONICA:
 ohh, sweetie!  hes gonna call you again.

RACHEL:
 yeah, maybe, but i dont think i even care. i dont think hes the one im sad about. yknow, i know that i said that i am totally okay with ross getting married, but as it turns out, i dont think im handling it all that well.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, maybe.

RACHEL:
 and i-i am just trying to figure out why.

PHOEBE:
 any luck?

RACHEL:
 well, yeah, yknow how ross and i were on again, off again, on again, off again? i guess i just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.

MONICA:
 again. yknow what? i think we all did.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 hey!  

ROSS:
 so, i got us some reservations for sunday night, okay? how about, ernies at 9 oclock?

 oh, see i-i dont know if were gonna be hungry at three.

RACHEL:
 three people. joshuas not gonna be there.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 uh, well, i think, i think he broke up with me.

ROSS:
 noo. why?

RACHEL:
 well, apparently he scares easy.

ROSS:
 oh, rachel, im-im sorry.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh, okay! 

MONICA:

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:

JOEY:

ROSS:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 i knew.

ROSS:
 you did! oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother.

RACHEL:
 i did.

ROSS:
 oh. listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if i asked you out? sometime? maybe?

RACHEL:
 yeah, maybe...

ROSS:
 okay... okay, maybe i will...  

ROSS:
  see, i see.... big passion in your future.

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
  ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much youve grown. y'know?  i mean my mom never thought this would work out. it was all, once a cheater, always a cheater.  ooh, i just wish we hadnt lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...

ROSS:
 we were on a break!!!!!!!     

RACHEL:
 you seem to really like her.

ROSS:
 yeah, i really do. yeah, but what am i gonna do, i mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yknow no commitment.

RACHEL:
 ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through monicas photo albums, i mean you dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks.

ROSS:
 you think?

RACHEL:
 yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

ROSS:
 hey, youre right.

RACHEL:
 yeah.   commercial break 

MONICA:
 ohh, this is soo amazing! i cant believe my brothers getting married! and in london! its so romantic!

MONICA:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune.

MONICA:
 i can't believe he did this.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 i know.  so little time to do it in. closing credits  

CHANDLER:
 all right, check it out. check this out. it says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!   "its almost as good as being there."

JOEY:
 its better! you cant go to a museum in your underwear!

CHANDLER:
 well, you could, but... probably just the one time.

JOEY:
 i bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a vcr in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!

CHANDLER:
 if we do that, we gotta get die hard.

PHOEBE:
  been here!

MONICA:
 thats also like the tenth time you told us.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, oh im sorry, it must be really hard to hear! i tell ya, its a lot easier having three babies play bringing in the noise, bringing in da funk on your bladder! im so sick of being pregnant! the only happiness i get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, causeoh! im pregnant!

JOEY:
 of course!!  

PHOEBE:
 hi, guys.

RACHEL:
 hi! phoebe. 

MONICA:
 hi phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 i-i wanted to apologise if iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. yknow its just the hormones, yknow.

RACHEL:
 no we

MONICA:
 hormones.

RACHEL:
 hormones, yeah.

PHOEBE:
 anyway, i just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. 

MONICA:
 wow, you seem to be doing so much better. thats great. so how-how are things going?

PHOEBE:
 good. yknowno-no, okay, its-it feels like everythings been about me lately, so whats happening with you?

RACHEL:
 oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to rosss wedding.

PHOEBE:
 oh!

RACHEL:
 it just might be too hard, given the history and all that

PHOEBE:
 wow! this reminds me of the time when i was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him.

RACHEL:
 well, h-how is this like that?

PHOEBE:
 well, lets see, its not. really, like that. because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like yknow a bunch of yknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 alrighty, here come the water works.  

JOEY:
 ugh! i dont know what im going to do! i called the company that sent and th-they dont care! then i called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey

ROSS:
 i just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! and the guys from work had a blast. yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. yeah! and-and another one had never been to a party before, so

JOEY:
 so uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? man, thats nice!

ROSS:
 yeah, right!

JOEY:
 i was uh, i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, i might want to get one of those

ROSS:
 that ring? when my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.

CHANDLER:
 so you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?  

ROSS:
 oh absolutely! it has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.

CHANDLER:
 so you might say, its a magic ring.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 my-my ring? my-my wedding ring? the-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! h-how?! how could this all happen?!

CHANDLER:
 well, i think it all started when you said, "hey joey, why dont you be my best man."

ROSS:
  cops!

JOEY:
 dude, i screwed up, you dont have to turn me in!

ROSS:
 not on you! on the stripper!

JOEY:
 oh, yeah, well i already did that! they said theyre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.

ROSS:
 okay, well, well call the company that sent her!

JOEY:
 i did that too! they wouldnt give me her real name or her number. they said, "if i bothered them again theyd call the police." i said, "if you talk to the police, you tell them im missing a ring!"

ROSS:
 so what, joey? wh-wh-what? what are you telling me? that theres nothing we can do? well, how could this happen?!

JOEY:
 look ross, i am so-so sorry. i-i-i

CHANDLER:
 well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?

JOEY:
 oh, that sounds like fun, but weve got a ring to find!! 

MONICA:
 heres your tea phoebe.  

PHOEBE:
   oh, thanks.

RACHEL:
 good.

MONICA:
 im so glad you liked it.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 what?! she made the tea! 

PHOEBE:
 oh! no, i-i think i just had a contraction.

RACHEL:
 you what?

MONICA:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i thought i had one a couple of minutes ago, and now i know that was definitely one.

MONICA:
 wait, you cant have the baby here! i mean i havent sterilised it since the guys moved out!

RACHEL:
 okay. its okay. were gonna be okay. yknow what? its okay. im gonna, im gonna, im gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!

PHOEBE:
 no. its all right; its probably false labour. they said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.

MONICA:
 rachel, get the book! the book!

RACHEL:
 okay! 

MONICA:
 the bible?!

RACHEL:
 i dont know! 

JOEY:
 all right, okay, this is great, uh, chandler, you get behind the desk. and-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she? uh, okay, and then you buzz ross and i.  be uh, mr. wong.

ROSS:
 diverse. 

 did anybody call for security?

CHANDLER:
  

 okay, which one of you guys is gunther central-perk?  hey, joey?

ROSS:
 wheres my ring? my dead grandmothers wedding ring? where is it? where is it?

CHANDLER:
 way to be cool, man.

 whats he talking about?

JOEY:
 there was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!

 wait, you guys think i stole some ring? 

 yeah!

ROSS:
 we know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!

 okay, who are you? the hardy boys? look, i dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right? i make $1,600 a week doing what i do; any of you guys make that?

CHANDLER:
 marry me.   

JOEY:
 i dont get it! it was in my room all night! and if she didnt take it, and i didnt take it; and you   same moment and stare at joey, who doesnt get it. after a short pause, with the duck  

RACHEL:
 i still dont get how you know when its false labour.

PHOEBE:
 well, do you see any babies?

MONICA:
 how do you feel?

PHOEBE:
 okay, i guess. i mean i dont know, its just, i guess i know its going to be over soon.

RACHEL:
 well, isnt that a good thing? you said you were sick of this.

PHOEBE:
 i know. its just yknow usually when youre, when youre done with the pregnant thing, yknow, then you get to do the mom thing. im gonna be yknow, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.

MONICA:
 some moms do that.

PHOEBE:
 okay thats even sadder. look, i know, i know what i got myself into, its just that now that theyre in me its like, its like i know them yknow, i mean-i mean, its just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.

MONICA:
 aww, sweetie, but its not like youre not gonna have anything. youre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thats even better.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, okay.

RACHEL:
 no, really. really, pheebs, youre not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when theyre bad, yknow, or deciding to put them on ritalin when they just wont calm down. yknow?

MONICA:
 i mean, youre the one theyre gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.

RACHEL:
 and you just get to be cool aunt phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 cool aunt phoebe. i am pretty cool!

MONICA:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 and yknow what else, oh my god, are they gonna love you.

PHOEBE:
 they are gonna love me.

RACHEL:
 oh!

PHOEBE:
 thanks you guys! again.

MONICA:
 oh, sweetie! 

PHOEBE:
 youre the best. thanks. oh!  

 what?!

PHOEBE:
 just kidding. ahh!

RACHEL:
 what?!

MONICA:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 got cha again, you guys are so easy.  

JOEY:
 if anything should happen to him

ROSS:
 joey! the vet said its a simple procedure.

JOEY:
 so! things can go wrong! you dont know! what if he doesnt make it?!

CHANDLER:
 he will, joe.

JOEY:
 yeah, but what if he doesnt? hes such a good duck.  first one is joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. then its chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching baywatch when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. then we see ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. he takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. then its chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls apartment, joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then chandler playing hide-and-go-seek with them, and its concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping its wings. and 

JOEY:
 im so worried about him, yknow?

 

ROSS:
 oh my god! thank you! thank you so much!  

JOEY:
 h-h-h-hows the duck?

 hes doing just fine, hes resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.

JOEY:
 ohh, great! oh hey, listen ross, thanks for being so cool about this.

ROSS:
 no, thats all right.

JOEY:
 no, its not. i mean you-you made me your best man and i totally let you down!

CHANDLER:
 hey, come on, its not your fault.

JOEY:
 yeah, it is! you wouldnt have lost the ring, right? yknow what, ross you were right from the start, he 

CHANDLER:
 no, you should.

JOEY:
 now, dont argue with me

ROSS:
 hey! hey! hey! i get to choose my best man, and i want both you guys. 

CHANDLER:
 really?

JOEY:
 really?

ROSS:
 hey, both you guys should be up there with me. i mean, you two are-are my i mean, im lucky to have just one good  

CHANDLER:
 thanks man.

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 six-hour trip to london. thats a lot of monica.  

MONICA:
 passport, check!  check! travellers cheques, check! 

RACHEL:
 who are you saying "check" too?

MONICA:
 myself. yknow for remembering to pack a thing. yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. well, actually, she only did it the one time. but it was pretty weird.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:

ROSS:

MONICA:

 and that was all before 10 oclock. the caterer rang and said it was going to be chicken kiev instead of chicken tarragon. and then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips. oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. were not gonna be

ROSS:
 whoa-whoa-whoa! emily, 

 well, up yours too!

ROSS:
 what?! no! no! thats-thats time-out!

 sorry.

ROSS:
 sweetie, you gotta relax. everythings gonna be great, okay? come on. come on.

MONICA:
 chicken kiev?

ROSS:
 um-hmm! doesnt that sound delicious at the last minute?

MONICA:
 yeah, yknow, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. and, you wouldnt have to worry about the salmonella.   so, i cant wait to see this place youre getting married!

ROSS:
 yeah. yeah. yes, this place is beautiful. emilys parents got married here.

 i still cant believe theyre tearing it down. it really is the most lovely building youll ever see. i mean its over   oh my god!

MONICA:
 its nice.

 oh. oh.  

  are we going to do?

ROSS:
 its all right! everythings gonna be all right.

 hows it gonna be all right?!

ROSS:
 uh-huh, i see that.

MONICA:
  what happened. 

ROSS:
 what? what?

MONICA:
 they torn it down a few days early.  

JOEY:
 all right! westminster abbey! hands down, best abbey ive ever seen. hey!  chandler?

CHANDLER:
 i think its great. its great. yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.

JOEY:
 really? to what?

CHANDLER:
 to put the camera away!!!

JOEY:
 man, you are westminster crabby.    

PHOEBE:
 oh. oh.

RACHEL:
 oh, honey! dont get up! what do you need?

PHOEBE:
 oh, no. oh, nothing.

RACHEL:
 come on! i am here to take care of you! what do you need? anything.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i have a wedgie.

RACHEL:
 okay, that is all you.

PHOEBE:
 so-so, what do you want for lunch?

RACHEL:
 oh, i dont know. i guess we have to eat.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i do. whats the matter?

RACHEL:
 im just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i shouldnt have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me.

PHOEBE:
 eh, dont be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

RACHEL:
 im not in love with ross!

PHOEBE:
 oh. no. no. good! yeah, me neither.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, im going to rosss wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. not because, im still in love with him! i mean, hey, yknow, i like ross as much as the next guy, yknow? clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings dont mean love! i mean, i still have loving feelings for ross. yeah! but, i have, i have continuing feelings of love, but that doesnt mean that-that im still in love with him. yknow? i-i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love himohh! oh my god! oh mywhy didnt you tell me?!!

PHOEBE:
 we thought you knew!

RACHEL:
 we?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, we all know! we talk about it all the time!

RACHEL:
 you all know? does ross know?

PHOEBE:
 oh no, ross doesnt know anything.

RACHEL:
 oh, i can not believe you didnt tell me!

PHOEBE:
 well, because we thought you knew!! its so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, "hey, you like things clean." 

JOEY:
 hey!

 so, what are you guys in the market for? weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...

JOEY:
 check this out? huh?   yeah. thats the stuff. what do you think?

CHANDLER:
 well, i dont have to buy that, "im with stupid" t-shirt anymore.

JOEY:
 well, i like it. here you go. 

CHANDLER:
 all right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?

JOEY:
 oh, i embarrass you? 

CHANDLER:
 how can i answer that when im pretending i dont know you?

 hes just jealous. youll fit right in; all londoners wear them!

CHANDLER:
 oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them?

 

CHANDLER:
 all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.

JOEY:
 oh yeah?  you and the hat? i choose the hat.

 good choice.

JOEY:
 thanks.

CHANDLER:
 okay, wait. all right, thats it, okay, im out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore!   

 hello?

ROSS:
 hey! i just spoke to your dad, and you know what? he seems to think well be able to find a new place for the wedding.

 we dont have to.

ROSS:
 whoa-whoa-what? you found a place?

 no. but, monica and i were talking, and-and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.

ROSS:
 she said what?

 she said, "if im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."

ROSS:
 postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?   this isnt right.

 i realize that people are going to be disappointed. but, im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.

ROSS:
 i cant ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that? 

 dont you point your pants at me!  have no choice! anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, ross dont you understand? this is our wedding im talking about.

ROSS:
 the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when were getting married.

 so what are you saying? its now or never?

ROSS:
 no. im saying its now.  

 or?

ROSS:
 theres no or in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!!

 its not the pants. its you that is backwards. and if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all! 

ROSS:
  wait! emily! no, wait, stop! emily, please  commercial break  

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross?

RACHEL:
 manhattan does not have enough stores.

PHOEBE:
 well, i think i can help you get over him.

RACHEL:
 you can?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross.

RACHEL:
 um-hmm.

PHOEBE:
 and a small piece of chocolate.

RACHEL:
 okay.

PHOEBE:
 and a glass of tepid water. 

RACHEL:
 ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?

PHOEBE:
 uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just didnt feel like getting up. okay, im gonna show you a picture of ross. okay? and youre going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws.

RACHEL:
 i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out.

PHOEBE:
 okay. umm, before we get started, i just wanna say for the record that i love ross, i think hes such a great guy. here.   okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that youre with ross okay and imagine that youre kissing him. and youre-youre running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross its some kind of grease, itsuck! hah?

RACHEL:
 i dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.

PHOEBE:
 okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, lets try some uh, aversion therapy.

RACHEL:
 okay.

PHOEBE:
 okay?

RACHEL:
 all right.

PHOEBE:
 so uh, now look at the picture

RACHEL:
 okay.

PHOEBE:
 all right, and umm   

RACHEL:
 ow!

PHOEBE:
 okay, how do you feel now?

RACHEL:
 well, i like you less!  

JOEY:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey. 

JOEY:
 oh. 

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no, yknow what? i really shouldnt have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really wasnt cool. and if it makes you feel any better, ive had a really lousy day.

JOEY:
 me too.

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 noo!! ive had the best day ever! dude, check this out!

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 sh-shh-shh!   

JOEY:
  

  friends name?

JOEY:
 

 hi chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 thats thats was

MONICA:
 oh my god!

JOEY:
 thats fergie baby!!

 joey says you dont really like his hat, but i think its kinda dashing.

CHANDLER:
 how did you? how? how?

JOEY:
 well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right? so, im in my map and-and

MONICA:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hi. i understand you had a little talk with emily.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 am i?! and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!

MONICA:
 umm

CHANDLER:
 im gonna go to the bathroom.

JOEY:
 wait up! 

ROSS:
 hey-hey, since youre the fix-it lady, heres a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesnt want to have the wedding at all?

MONICA:
 she said that?!

ROSS:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 why?!

ROSS:
 i dont know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.

MONICA:
 oh my god. youre even dumber than i am!

ROSS:
 excuse me?

MONICA:
 ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?

ROSS:
 i dont know. a month?

MONICA:
 emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. thats what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake   thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.

ROSS:
 i had no idea. and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.

MONICA:
 sometimes we were.

ROSS:
 come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay?

MONICA:
 okay.

ROSS:
 come on. 

CHANDLER:
 that was pretty intense huh?

JOEY:
 yeah.  there because we were uncomfortable being out here!

CHANDLER:
  

PHOEBE:
 hello.

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway. and i was gonna go over and say hi! but then i figured, he doesnt care if he looks like you.

JOEY:
 that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?

PHOEBE:
 ohh, theyre having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel hasnt been helpful at all. so, do you miss me?

JOEY:
 kinda, but ive just been having way too much fun.

PHOEBE:
 so youre not homesick yet?

JOEY:
 no, i dont think so.

PHOEBE:
 all right, the seven of us miss you.

JOEY:
 whos seven?

PHOEBE:
 yknow, me, rachel, the birds, the babies

JOEY:
 ahh, the babies miss me? 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, the pizza guys here!

JOEY:
 what? you ordered pizza without me?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah. but yknow we were thinking about you, yknow we ordered the joey special.

JOEY:
 two pizzas?!

PHOEBE:
 yep! okay, gotta go, talk to you later.

JOEY:
 wait, well, where did you get it from?!   and turns on a rerun of cheers, with the theme song playing. at first, hes  

 monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!

MONICA:
 youll see.

 i tell you, this wedding is not going to happen. 

 oh god.

ROSS:
 okay? but-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? and-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles

MONICA:
 and the musicians, look, they can go over here  , okay? and the chairs can face this way  go.

ROSS:
 but-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time. really, its fine, whatever you want.

 its perfect.

ROSS:
 and, i dont know, if it starts to rain

 well then well get wet. 

MONICA:
 ohh. and i dont even have a date. 

RACHEL:
 pheebs?

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 do you remember where the duck food is?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. why?

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 what?! what do you mean youre going to london?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i have to tell ross that i love him. now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until i get back. 

PHOEBE:
 irachel, you cant go! ross loves emily!

RACHEL:
 yeah, i know, i know, i know he does. but i have to tell him how i feel! he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.

PHOEBE:
 thats not why youre going! youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "yeah, i love you too, rach. forget that british chippy."

RACHEL:
 ohhdo you think he will?!

PHOEBE:
 no! because hes in love with the british chippy! look, rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! yknow, its too late! you missed youre chance! im sorry, i know this must be really hard, its over.

RACHEL:
 yknow what? no. its not over until someone says, "i do." 

PHOEBE:
 i do! i do! i do!   i do!  commercial break  

 the waltham residence.

PHOEBE:
 oh...yes..is this..umm..emilys parents house. 

 this is the housekeeper speaking. and by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. first one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak. 

PHOEBE:
  its not too much trouble, please, umm, might i speak to miss emily waltham, please?

 miss waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and its not polite to make fun of people. goodbye. 

PHOEBE:
 no no no, ill be nice, i swear!!!   could you just give me the number for where they are? 

 im afraid, im not at liberty to divulge that information. 

PHOEBE:
 ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. and i have to warn somebody, alright. so if you dont give me that number then im going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to new glocken..shire. 

 hangs up. 

PHOEBE:
 hello, hello. ohh, ohh, she knew i could kick her ass.   

MONICA:

MONICA:
 ha ha, a joke thats funny in all countries.

JOEY:

 goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.   

JOEY:
   everything's different here...i want to go home. i...i miss my family. i miss the coffee house. i cant even remember what phoebe looks like.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
    

  

ROSS:

  floor. new guest bath, landscaping. im paying to remodel this guys house.   im going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind. 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

 ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments. 

ROSS:
 i go back there with lawn ornaments, hes going to laugh in my face. 

 this is ridiculous. i mean we had an agreement.   will you say something, steven?! please!!!

RACHEL:
  

PHOEBE:
  your mind. oh, look i know you probably want to be alone, and you dont want to talk about it, thats fine. i just want you to know, i think you are doing the right thing and... 

RACHEL:
  

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

  can i interrupt? you know i just want to say..that you are a horrible, horrible person. 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
   

JOEY:

ROSS:
   my god. you...you look beautiful. 

  not meant to see me before the wedding. its bad luck. 

ROSS:
 you know what, i think weve had all the bad luck were going to have.   comes in the door and walks by joey unnoticed. she walks into the chapel and sees ross and emily kissing. she looks as though she wants to cry. emily walks away and ross turns and  

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 seven times!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 in a foreign, romantic country

MONICA:
 i blame london.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 so look umm, while were st-still in london, i mean, we can keep doing it right?

CHANDLER:
 well, i dont see that we have a choice. but, when were back home, we dont do it.

MONICA:
 only here.

CHANDLER:
 yknow, i saw a wine cellar downstairs

MONICA:
 ill meet you there in two minutes.

CHANDLER:
 okay!   

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 ross said my name up there, i mean, come on, i just cant pretend that didnt happen can i?

MONICA:
 oh, i-i dont know.

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 just uh, do the right thing. 

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 toe the line. thread the needle. think outside the box!  

RACHEL:
 whoa, wait, listen, i think im just gonna talk to ross about what he think it meant.

MONICA:
 wait. rachel, no, hes married. married! if you dont realize that, i cant help you.

RACHEL:
 okay, youre right. youre right. you cant help me. 

 jack, is it all our fault? were we bad parents?

 

 oh yeah, well who serves steak when theres no place to sit, i mean how are you supposed to eat this?

JOEY:
 hey, whats up?   

MONICA:
 where were you? we were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 why?!

  minutes 

MONICA:
 joey, what are you doing? you promised phoebe you wouldnt eat meat until she has the babies!

JOEY:
 well, i figured were in another country, so it doesnt count.

MONICA:
 thats true.

CHANDLER:
 the mans got a point. 

RACHEL:
 oh, hi!

ROSS:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 hi. sorry, things arent working out so well.

ROSS:
 oh no! it could be better, but its gonna be okay, right?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! of course, i mean, shes gonna get over this, yknow? i mean, so you said my name! yknow you just said it cause you saw me there, if youd have seen a circus freak, you wouldve said, "i take thee circus freak." yknow, it didnt mean anything, its just a mistake. it didnt mean anything. right?

ROSS:
 no! no! of course it didnt mean anything! i mean, uh well, i can understand why emily would think it meant something, yknow, because-because it was you

RACHEL:
 right

ROSS:
 but it absolutely didnt.  didnt!! it didnt!!

JOEY:
  dance with emily, so

ROSS:
  the band saysi dont care about the stupid band!!

JOEY:
 you spit on me man! 

ROSS:
 look, im sorry.

JOEY:
 emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?

RACHEL:
  it was because i was trying to pop the window out of the frame.

ROSS:
 oh, right!

RACHEL:
 get the hell out of there, yknow?  

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 well, look at that, same thing. 

CHANDLER:
 listen, in the middle of everything if i scream the word, "yippee!" just ignore me. 

MONICA:
 oh my god, rachel! hi!

CHANDLER:
 oh, hello rachel.

RACHEL:
 ross said my name. okay? my name. ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!  believe me, i know im rightdo you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?

CHANDLER:
 yes, we do. but, we have to change first.

MONICA:
 yes, i want to change. and why-why dont you go down and get us a table?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well be down in like five minutes.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 okay. 

RACHEL:
 hello? oh, pheebs! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, yay

MONICA:
 great

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 hi, so what happened?

RACHEL:
 well, ross said my name.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i know, but i dont think that means anything.

RACHEL:
 okay, pheebs, yknow what, lets look at this objectively all right? ninth grade, right? the obsession starts. all right? the summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. so then

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 but my clothes areohh!   after seeing that he isnt, ushers monica into the room, closes the door, and the 

CHANDLER:
 wow, you look

MONICA:
 no time for that!  

JOEY:
 hey, dude, let me in. i got a girl out here!

CHANDLER:
 well, ive got a girl in here.

JOEY:
 no you dont, i just saw you go in there with monica!

CHANDLER:
 well, were-were hanging out in here!

JOEY:
 look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?

CHANDLER:
 well, i suppose id have to say you!! but, what if were watching a movie in here?

MONICA:
 which we are, and-and we already paid for it. its my giant!

JOEY:
 my giant? i love that movie!  

MONICA:
 you really think this is okay?

CHANDLER:
 well, ross and emily arent gonna use it.

MONICA:
 oh, its so beautiful. ohh! yknow, i-i dont know if i feel right about this.

CHANDLER:
 oh mon-mon-mon-mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. the room expects sex. the room would be disappointed if it didnt get sex. all of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.

MONICA:
 okay!

CHANDLER:
 okay! 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 nope, not under here!

MONICA:
 you didnt find her?

ROSS:
 no, ive looked everywhere!

CHANDLER:
 well, you couldnt have looked everywhere or else you wouldve found her!

MONICA:
 yeah, i think you should keep looking!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, for about 30 minutes.

MONICA:
 or 45.

CHANDLER:
 wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. 

ROSS:
 no! for all i know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because i kept moving around. no, from now on, im staying in one place.   right here.

MONICA:
 well, its getting late.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, were gonna go.

ROSS:
 actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?

MONICA:
 ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for new york.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, its a very large plane.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 but, well stay here with you.

ROSS:
 thanks guys!  appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.  commercial break  head in monicas lap and his feet on chandlers lap. monica and chandler are 

CHANDLER:
 we have to leave for new york in an hour.

MONICA:
 i know, ive been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, dont you think?

CHANDLER:
 we cant do that thats insane. i mean a he could wake up and b yknow, lets go for it.  

ROSS:
 em-emily?  emily! 

 no.

 you can forget about emily, shes not with us.

 weve come for her things.

ROSS:
 wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?

 shes in hiding. shes utterly humiliated. she doesnt want to see you ever again.

 were very sad that it didnt work out between you and emily, monkey. but, i think youre absolutely delicious.

 excuse me, im standing right here!

 oh yes, there you are.

RACHEL:
  oh hurry up, get some, theres a whole cart outside  

 goodbye geller.

ROSS:
 now, hold on! hold on!  supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that im gonna be at that airport and i hope that shell be there too! oh yeah, i said rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, okay? shes-shes just a friend and thats all!  i love her and that i cant imagine spending my life with anyone else. please, promise me that youll tell her that.

 all right, ill tell her. 

 

 you spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!  

MONICA:
 yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  yknow, technically we still are over international waters.

MONICA:
 im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe ill see you there in a bit?

CHANDLER:
 kay!  

JOEY:
 can i ask you something?

CHANDLER:
 uhh, no.

JOEY:
 felicity and i, were watching my giant, and i was thinking, "im never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." do you think im just wasting my life with this acting thing?

CHANDLER:
 no.

JOEY:
 i mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, you think ill ever get there?

CHANDLER:
 yes.

JOEY:
 thanks man. 

CHANDLER:
 okay man. 

JOEY:
 but what about how much taller he is than me? 

JOEY:
 i mean, theres no way i can make myself taller now, yknow? and who knows what science will come up with in the future, but chandler, what if i die an unsuccessful, regular sized man? 

JOEY:
 hey, monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.

MONICA:
 i know!

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 no we didnt!

PHOEBE:
 i know you didnt, i was talking about monica.

MONICA:
 phoebe, i did not have sex.

PHOEBE:
 this pregnancy is throwing me all off.

JOEY:
 all right, im gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.

PHOEBE:
 oh, me too!

JOEY:
 why would you need to say hi to them, youve been feeding them for four days?

PHOEBE:
 oh right, maybe ill just go home.   

MONICA:
 well, we certainly are alone.

CHANDLER:
 yes! good thing we have that, not in new york rule.

MONICA:
 right. umm, listen since were-we-re on that subject, umm, i just wanted to tell you that uh, well, i-i was going through a really hard time in london, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking i was rosss mother

CHANDLER:
 right.

MONICA:
 well, an-anyway, i justthat night meant a lot to me, i guess im just trying to say thanks.

CHANDLER:
 oh. yknow, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasnt because i was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me cause, youre really hot! is that okay?

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 oh, ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, em-i-ly.  

MONICA:
 rach, that's great! it's so good that you had a good time in greece!

RACHEL:
 what?! i didn't have a good time in greece! ross abandoned me! okay, i couldn't get a plane out, so i had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "oh, mrs. geller, why are you crying?" i mean, it was sooo humiliating. i felt like such an idiot! i mean, it's all my fault! and you know why, because i make very bad decisions.

CHANDLER:
 oh that's not true.

RACHEL:
 yes it is! it is true! i went, i went after ross in stupid london.

PHOEBE:
 london is stupid! stupid!

RACHEL:
 phoebe, you were right. i should've never gone to london, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.

PHOEBE:
 oh no, i did that for someone once and i'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.

MONICA:
 i'll do it!

RACHEL:
 that's fine. so monica, you are now in control of my love life.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i gotta go to work.  amazement. after the kiss ends, chandler suddenly realizes what he just did, so he decides

 sweetie! edges! fingers! smudgey! pictures!

RACHEL:
 oh my god! 

MONICA:
 okay. that's okay. i-i know that you're very upset right now. i know, i know that wasn't about me.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 if you would stop thinking about ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! i mean, look! look, gunther!   i mean, he's nice, he's cute.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i guess gunther is kinda

MONICA:
   remember? that is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.

PHOEBE:
 ohh, that's so nice! how great! well, where? where's the trip?!

MONICA:
 well, we thought we would all go to a picnic  park!

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 yeah, all of us! all day!

PHOEBE:
 that sucks! that's not a trip! i just came from the park! what are we gonna high five about at the stupid central park? "well, it's right by my house, all right!" 

CHANDLER:
 well, i'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my central park idea. 

RACHEL:
  kissey! y'know, i've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new european thing you got going on, and i just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and i justy'knowstop it!

CHANDLER:
 i was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.

PHOEBE:
 that's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.

MONICA:
 makes me wanna puke!   

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 ooh, atlantic city! oh, that's a great plan! who's plan was that?

JOEY:

MONICA:
 no! rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.

RACHEL:
 well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.

MONICA:
 okay, rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i-i don't care.

MONICA:
 okay. i-i can't watch. 

RACHEL:
 what 'cha readin'?

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 events from around the globe.

RACHEL:
 okay. uhh, ross, y'know what, there's something that i-that i have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that i shouldn't tell you, but i think they're wrong. i mean, and you know how people can be wrong.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 okay, ross, i'm really trying to tell you something here.

ROSS:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 umm, okay, i think i'm-i'm just gonna-just gonna say it. just gonna say it. uhh,  

ROSS:
 wow. umm huh i'm-i'm not sure what to do with that right now. 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 why are you laughing?

RACHEL:
 because  ridiculous! i mean, you're married. you're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, i sort of like, i floated up out of my body, y'know? and, and-and then i heard myself say it and then the floating rachel  "you are such an idiot!"

ROSS:
 well, well i am married. even though i haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 actually, it kinda is. my wife won't return my calls. i don't know where my wife is. 

RACHEL:
 oh god, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that i told you this?

ROSS:
 well, i kinda half to. i mean, because the thing is

RACHEL:
 the thing is y'know, that you're married to emily.

ROSS:
 that is what the thing is.

RACHEL:
 ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? i mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?

ROSS:
 no. no. no, i'm-i'm glad you did. look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.

RACHEL:
 that's what i said! thank you for being so nice. 

ROSS:
 no thank you for thank you. 

ROSS:
 okay, let's go!

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 i know, it's beautiful. amazing. 

CHANDLER:
 y'know what else i can't believe? i had to kiss phoebe and rachel every time i left a room, i mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 hey, what took you guys so long? your cab left when ours did! 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 oh man! i did it again!

PHOEBE:
   and then my mom wants to know-

JOEY:
 i gotta get the before shot!  opening credits 

RACHEL:
 hi, pheebs? okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.

PHOEBE:
 what?!

ROSS:
 apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, she's so stupid!

ROSS:
 look, pheebs-pheebs, it's gonna be okay.

PHOEBE:
 that's easy for you to say, i don't see three kids coming out your vagina!

RACHEL:
 honey, listen, y'know what? the nurse said the doctor is wonderful.

ROSS:
 yeah, he's head of the department.

PHOEBE:
 all rightooh! oh dead god, save me! 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 i'm having my first contraction!

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 ooh, it's not bad.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 oh!  aaiiyyyeeee! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! you okay?

JOEY:
 ooh, something hurts!

PHOEBE:
 ooh, it's sympathy pains. ohh, that's so sweet!

JOEY:
 are they? i didn't know i cared that much. 

ROSS:
 hello.

 hi! phoebe, i'm dr. harad, i'm going to be delivering your babies. i want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. i've been doing this for a long time. i'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. and also, i love fonzie. 

CHANDLER:
 did he just say, he loves fonzie?

MONICA:
 that's what it sounded like.

CHANDLER:
 all right

 

 hey!

 

PHOEBE:
 no-no-no! we haven't started yet. where's alice?

 uh, delaware. she's on her way though, so until she gets here, i'm gonna be your coach. but don't worry, she told me all about the la-mazada stuff.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.

 yeah. 

RACHEL:
  with two unbelievably cute nurses.

JOEY:
 oh my!

RACHEL:
 they're male nurses.

JOEY:
 not in my head.

RACHEL:
 anyway, they want to take us out saturday night! what do you say?

MONICA:
 umm.  so.

RACHEL:
 what? what are you talking about?! you-you're the one who's been telling me to get over ross and move on. i'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.

MONICA:
 umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then i'll tell you if it's true.

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 harder than it sounds. isn't it?

RACHEL:
 okay, you're coming with me, and i also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some jell-o with them.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 joey, how do you make that dirty?

JOEY:
 oh, it's easy. yeah, i-i can do it with anything. watch uh,   grandma's chicken salad 

JOEY:
   hey babies! these are the headlines on the day you were born! okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies   check it out, huh?! this is what naked women looked like the month you were born. all right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay, i'm having another one! this one doesn't hurt eitherooh, yes it does! ow! ow! ow! ow! ooh!  was it.

ROSS:
 hey, where are monica and rachel anyway?

JOEY:
 oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. maybe they're with them.

CHANDLER:
 really? male nurses?

JOEY:
 yeah, i was bummed too.

CHANDLER:
 so they're going on dates? when?

JOEY:
 i think saturday

 

PHOEBE:
 umm, sympathy pains. i thought it was really sweet at first, but now i think he's just trying to steal my thunder.

 

PHOEBE:
 hey.

 let's see what we got here. ohh, y'know, fonzie dated triplets.

CHANDLER:
 this-this fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?

 oh no-no-no. fonzie is the nickname of arthur fonzerelli. the fonz.

CHANDLER:
 all right. 

 it's not that weird, is it?

PHOEBE:
 it's very weird! i don't want some guy down there telling me, i'm y'know, dilatedamundo!

ROSS:
 to be fair, he doesnt seem to be impersonating fonzie

PHOEBE:
  get me another doctor! one who is not crazy and who is not fonzie!

ROSS:
 again, it's not that he  

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 umm, listen there's something i think you should know.

CHANDLER:
 oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? yeah, joey already told me, and i am so-so fine. i mean, you and i we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.

MONICA:
 umm, actually i was about to tell you that i was, i was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe i will go out with him.

CHANDLER:
 fine! maybe i will too!

JOEY:
  what i found in the giiiiiiift shop.   get up! get up! get up!   

ROSS:
 okay, phoebe, this dr. oberman. he has no strong feelings about fonzie or any of the happy days gang.

PHOEBE:
 hi! and you're going into what grade?

 umm, i'm actually a first year resident, but i get that a lot, you see, i-i graduated early

PHOEBE:
  i'd be needing a grown up doctor. 

 oh no, i'm fully qualified to

PHOEBE:
 shh! doogie, shh! doesn't anybody understand that i'm gonna be having babies soon? huh? go! go little boy, go! 

 oh cool! you made him cry!  

 mr. tribbiani, i'm afraid you've got kidney stones.

JOEY:
 umm, well, what else could it be?

 it's kidney stones.

JOEY:
 or?

 kidney stones! 

 all right, you're getting there. oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.

PHOEBE:
 they are. why?

 they have the honor of being born on the fonz's half-birthday.

PHOEBE:
 happy birthday!

 just-just to clarify, i'm not fonzie.  

RACHEL:
 honey, y'know i just gotta tell you, i think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for frank and alice.

PHOEBE:
 i know, it is.

RACHEL:
 yeah!

PHOEBE:
 can i tell you a little secret?

RACHEL:
 yeah!

PHOEBE:
 i want to keep one. 

RACHEL:
 ohh, i'm gonna be on the news! commercial break 

RACHEL:
 okay, phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. i mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!

PHOEBE:
 why not?! maybe i can, you don't know!

RACHEL:
 yes! yes! yes, i do! i do know! frank and alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!

PHOEBE:
 maybe not! y'know? seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. listen, i-i hate to miss an opportunity just because i didn't ask! y'know?

RACHEL:
 phoebe, no! this is, this is insane.

PHOEBE:
 oh, just ask him!

RACHEL:
 me?!

PHOEBE:
 i can't ask him! do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! all i'm saying is just talk to frank. okay? just, y'know, feel him out!

RACHEL:
 no! forget it! i am not gonna ask frank to give you one of his kids!!

PHOEBE:
 you're right.  

PHOEBE:
 tell him it's for you. 

MONICA:
 feeling a little better sweetie?

JOEY:
 well, maybe a little. i wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

MONICA:
 me too.

ROSS:
 

 kidney stones! now, ordinarily mr. tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra

JOEY:
  up is not an optionwhat's a urethra?  you crazy?! 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 no, i haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.

PHOEBE:
 well, i'm kinda on a clock here.

 

RACHEL:
 y'know who i always liked? mork. 

PHOEBE:
 undo it. undo it. undo it.

 fonzie met mork. mork froze fonzie.

RACHEL:
 yeah, but umm yes, but, fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?

 yeah, that's right.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 hi!

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay, doctor says any minute now.

 hey, y'know, alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?

MONICA:
 well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not goof around with him.

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am so bad at this.

MONICA:
 i think you're better than you think you are.

CHANDLER:
 really? okay, so

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?

MONICA:
 yeah. all right, i'm gonna go tell dan that it's not gonna happen.   don't do the dance.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 so does it really hurt as bad as they say?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. you won't be able to take it.

CHANDLER:
 so uh, now that little chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?

PHOEBE:
 they're gonna call her chandler.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
  

RACHEL:
 hi! i just wanna-  oh my god!

MONICA:
  taking a nap.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 y'know what, just give me a second and i'll be out of your hair. i'm just gonna grab a jacket. when i get back, i want every little detail.   maybe that's him. 

MONICA:
  just joey and ross.

RACHEL:
 why aren't you guys at the movie?

JOEY:
 well, we were! but ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!

ROSS:
 i had to talk loud because the movie was loud!

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 but why?! did he get in touch with emily?

JOEY:
 well no, not yet. he's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.

ROSS:
  old twit!

JOEY:
 ross! way to suck up to the family.

CHANDLER:
   ha-ha-ha- here! my office finally got wrinkle free fax paper! opening credits  

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! no-no, vomit tux!

JOEY:
 don't worry, i had it dry-cleaned.

MONICA:
 vomit tux? who vomited ony'know what, what you up to joe?

JOEY:
 well, i'm doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co-host!

MONICA:
 oh that's great!

JOEY:
 a little uh, good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure, now that's the kind of math joey likes to do!

PHOEBE:
 ugh, pbs!

MONICA:
 what's wrong with pbs?

PHOEBE:
 ugh, what's right with them?

JOEY:
 why dont you like pbs, pheebs?

PHOEBE:
 okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. so, i just thought that it'd make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street, 'cause they were so nice when i was a little kid! no one ever wrote back.

CHANDLER:
 well y'know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.

PHOEBE:
 all i got was a lousy key chain! and by that time i was living in a box. i didn't have keys!

JOEY:
 i'm sorry pheebs, i just, y'know, i just wanted to do a good deed. like-like you did with the babies.

PHOEBE:
 this isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on tv! this is totally selfish.

JOEY:
 whoa! whoa! whoa! what about you, having those babies for your brother? talk about selfish!

PHOEBE:
 what-what are you talking about?!

JOEY:
 well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. so?

JOEY:
 it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.

PHOEBE:
 yes there are! there are totally good deeds that are selfless.

JOEY:
 well, may i ask for one example?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, it's y'know there'sno you may not!  

JOEY:
 that's because all people are selfish.

PHOEBE:
 are you calling me selfish?!

JOEY:
 are you calling you people?  burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. okay? and you the deal on santa clause right?

PHOEBE:
 i'm gonna find a selfless good dead. i'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. 

ROSS:
 

 

ROSS:
 emily? emily! oh my god! oh my god, it's emily!   it's emily everyone! shush-shush-shhst!  hi!

 ross, i'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. good-bye!

ROSS:
 no wait! look, wait! okay, you can hang up, but i'm gonna keep calling! i'm gonna, i'm gonna call everyone in england if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!

 really? about what?

ROSS:
 look you're my wife. we're-we're married. y'know? i-i love you. i-i really miss you.

 i miss you to. well, at least i think i do.

ROSS:
 

  is still holding the lamp ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to emily in 

PHOEBE:
 hey, joey, when you said the deal with santa clause, you meant?

JOEY:
 that he doesn't exist.

PHOEBE:
 right.  

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.

RACHEL:
 i dont care! i wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had! 

CHANDLER:
 really?! that's what you heard? 

MONICA:
 i might've said that. 

CHANDLER:
 because i'm very happy for him!  dog!

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

ROSS:
 well, emily's willing to work on the relationship.

CHANDLER:
 yes!

MONICA:
 that's great!

ROSS:
 in london!

MONICA:
 what?!

ROSS:
 she wants me to move to london.

MONICA:
 but you live here! 

RACHEL:
 what-what-what are you gonna do?

ROSS:
 i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben.

MONICA:
 yeah, i'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.

ROSS:
 it could happen.  

JOEY:
 

 this will be your phone.

JOEY:
 that's great. but uh, i'm not really expecting a lot of calls.

 no you answer it and take pledges.

JOEY:
 but i'm the host!

 no, gary collins is the host. you'll be answering the phones.

JOEY:
 you don't seem to understand. see, i was dr. drake remoray.

 well, here's your phone doctor.  

PHOEBE:
 i cannot believe i can't find a selfless good deed! y'know that old guy that lives next to me? well, i snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. but he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. then i felt wonderful. that old jackass!

RACHEL:
 maybe joey's right. maybe all good deeds are selfish.

PHOEBE:
 i will find a selfless good deed! 'cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 sure!

CHANDLER:
 if you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard?

RACHEL:
 chandler! 

MONICA:
 well, y'know i-i-i think i'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.

CHANDLER:
 why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, i'd be going like this.   

ROSS:
 all right emily, as much as i love you, i'm sorry, i can't move to london without ben.

 i understand that would be difficult.

ROSS:
 yeah, would you please consider moving here? i mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?

 i don't know, it's just

ROSS:
 oh-oh-okay, but-but i know, that even though i've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, i mean, i mean you-you-you have to come here. you have to come here so we can work this out.

 all right.

ROSS:
 all right, did you just say all right?

 i did. now i'm the idiot.

ROSS:
 oh, emily that is, that is so great. it's gonna be so great! we're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love! 

 ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.

ROSS:
 yes, tell me.

 well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.

ROSS:
 i know. i am, i am so sorry.

 and then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.

ROSS:
 again, very sorry.

 i mean, i can't-i can't be in the same room as her! it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!

ROSS:
 emily, there is nothing between rachel and me. okay? i love you.

 all right. i'll come to new york and we'll try and make this work.

ROSS:
 oh that is so great! that's

  commercial break  

ROSS:
 so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes.

CHANDLER:
 yes!

PHOEBE:
 ooh-ohh!

MONICA:
 great!

ROSS:
 no-no-no! only if i promise never to see rachel again.

PHOEBE:
 why?

MONICA:
 what?! you can'twhat did you tell her?

ROSS:
 i told her i'd have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision? 

CHANDLER:
 well, you can't just not see rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.

MONICA:
 yeah! but, he can't not exactly see emily, i mean that's his wife.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 that's true!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.

CHANDLER:
 that's true!

MONICA:
 no, you cannot.

ROSS:
 thanks for the help, problem solved.  

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 oh hey joey! we've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on tv?

JOEY:
 see, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but i'm still on tv and that's good exposure. 

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?  

CHANDLER:
 hey, there he is! there he is!

JOEY:
 hello new york!   

  cares, y'know? now i got the legs 

CHANDLER:
 how many times have i told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 uh, listen, i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day.

CHANDLER:
 oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars. 

MONICA:
 william sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.

CHANDLER:
 expect it in 4-6 weeks.  gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.

MONICA:
 yeah, so?

CHANDLER:
 well i just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.

MONICA:
 y'know what, champ? i think i'll pass.

CHANDLER:
 why?

MONICA:
 why?  

CHANDLER:
 what's your point? 

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
  that i found a selfless good deed. i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me.

JOEY:
 what?! what good is that gonna do anybody?

PHOEBE:
 well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. the bee is happy and i am definitely not.

JOEY:
 now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.

PHOEBE:
 

 back on in 30 seconds people! 

JOEY:
 hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?

 hey, no way, i'm in the shot man.

JOEY:
 come on man! you've been here all day!

 yeah, i-i'm taking pledges here, eh?

 we're on in 3, 2, 

 welcome back to our fall telethon. now if you've been enjoying the performance of cirque du soleil,   and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. all you have to do  that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to   

ROSS:
  difficult, so i'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.  

MONICA:
 a magic eight ball?! you can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!

PHOEBE:
 ooh, it's not a toy.

ROSS:
 well, i don't know what else to do. i mean, i either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before i'm 30! so-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'cause i-i got nothing! all right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  here we go. magic 8 ball, should i never see rachel again?   ask again later. later is not good enough.   ask again later. what the hell! this is broken! it-it is broken!

MONICA:
 all right, let me see.  tonight?  

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 hey pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 i would like to make a pledge. i would like to donate $200.

JOEY:
 $200? are you sure pheebs? i mean, after what sesame street did to ya?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i'm still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, i'm doing a good thing, but i'm not happy about it. so there, a selfless good deed.

JOEY:
 and you don't a little good about donating the money?

PHOEBE:
 no, it sucks. i was saving up to buy a hamster.

JOEY:
 a hamster? what, those things are like 10 bucks.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, not the one i had my eye on.

  thank you viewers! the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers  oh boy! and may i say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, 

PHOEBE:
 oh, look-look, joey's on tv! isn't that great? my pledge got joey on tv! oh that makes me feeloh no!    

CHANDLER:
  something you gotta know. if i'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.

MONICA:
 keep talking.

CHANDLER:
 i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which wouldn't take long. but when i'm with you, and we're together, ohmygod.

MONICA:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. we're too good! we owe it, to sex!

MONICA:
 well, if we owe it?   oh my when is joey gonna be home?

CHANDLER:
 well, i was kinda hoping we could do this without him.   oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.

MONICA:
 but, i just cleaned the bathroom.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.

MONICA:
 yeah.  

CHANDLER:
 all right, let's show them how it's done.

MONICA:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 ow!

CHANDLER:
 y'know that wasn't part of it?

MONICA:
 i know!   

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 for what?

RACHEL:
 for stella! remember? she's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.

ROSS:
 yeah, i uh, totally forgot about that. you mind if i take a rain check? i'm waiting for a call from emily.

RACHEL:
 sure. i guess. hey, i hear you don't have to go to london. yay!

ROSS:
 it's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.

RACHEL:
 like what?

ROSS:
 just stuff. y'know kinda what emily wants.

RACHEL:
 well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe i can help.

ROSS:
 no. no. you-you can't help. i mean, i kinda have to do this without your help.

RACHEL:
 well, i-i know you can do that too. i'm just, i'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to hi!

ROSS:
 thanks.

RACHEL:
 ross? look, whatever this relationship stuff that emily wants, just give it to her. come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. so just fix whatever she wants fixed. just do it.  try. you'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.  answer it! it's driving me crazy!

ROSS:
  umm, yes i've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, i can do it.  she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. all the time not  ending credits  closet and sneaks back to his seat and pretends he's reading something. then a short while later monica pokes her head out of the closet and sneaks back to her seat and sits down, 

MONICA:
 never done that before.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
  

JOEY:
 monica? what time is it?

CHANDLER:
 uhh, 9. 

JOEY:
 but it's dark out.

MONICA:
 well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! this is what 9 looks like.

JOEY:
 i guess i'll get washed up then. watch that sunrise.  

MONICA:
 i'm really getting tired of sneaking around.

CHANDLER:
 i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.

MONICA:
 all weekend? that's a whole lotta naked.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.

MONICA:
 ohh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey!

CHANDLER:
 okay, y'know your not though. let's go. 

MONICA:
 wait! what about joey?   opening credits  

MONICA:
  going to this culinary fair in new jersey.

PHOEBE:
 oh weird, chandler just told us he's got a conference there!

MONICA:
 oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like chandler's conference could've been in connecticut or vermont.

CHANDLER:
 i'm not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it's a fake conference? it's a real conference.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey.

ROSS:
 is rachel here? i gotta talk to her.

MONICA:
 no, she's out shopping.

ROSS:
 damn!

CHANDLER:
 what's going on?

ROSS:
 i told emily to come. and i just need to y'know, talk to rachel about it.

PHOEBE:
 wait a minute! so when emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see rachel anymore?

ROSS:
 well look, i'm just trying to focus on the "i get to see my wife," part, all right? and not the part that makes me do this.  

MONICA:
 wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? how is that even gonna work?

ROSS:
 i have no idea. i mean but-but i assure you i will figure it out. 

JOEY:
 doesnt seem like it's going to work, i mean

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hi!

CHANDLER:
 uh, hey!

RACHEL:
 what's going on?

CHANDLER:
 we're flipping monica's mattress.

JOEY:
 so i'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.

PHOEBE:
 yeah that's better than my way. 

RACHEL:
 oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?

CHANDLER:
 aww, man! 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 so, rach, y'know-y'know how emily's coming right?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! i know. 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh yes, somebody just said, "can you hear anything?" 

MONICA:
 hey, joey's ass! what are you doing?

JOEY:
  up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? well, when ross said rachel at the wedding, i figured it was gonna happen again, so i hid this in here.

MONICA:
 ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles

PHOEBE:
 ooh, madlibs, mine! 

CHANDLER:
 condoms?

JOEY:
 you don't know how long we're gonna be in here! we may have to repopulate the earth.

CHANDLER:
 and condoms are the way to do that? 

ROSS:
 anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time i talked to emily

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 oh my god, le poo, our dog!

ROSS:
 le poo's still alive?!

RACHEL:
 oh god, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine- my god.

MONICA:
 sweetie, we heard you crying. please don't cry.

RACHEL:
 it's le poo.

PHOEBE:
 i know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.  

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 ooh, chocolates on the pillows! i love that!

CHANDLER:
 oh, you should live with joey, roll-os everywhere.

MONICA:
 come here.   

CHANDLER:
 oh yes! monica, get in here! there's a high-speed car chase on! 

MONICA:
 we're switching rooms.

CHANDLER:
  glasses!

MONICA:
 no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! i mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  sweetie, i just want this weekend to be perfect, i mean we can change rooms, can't we?

CHANDLER:
 okay, but let's do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it's feed!  

ROSS:
 hey, so uh, y'know how there's something i wanted to talk to you about?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! 

ROSS:
 well, y'know how i'm trying to work things out with emily. well, there's this one thing okay,   here goes. i made a promise that- -oh hey!

RACHEL:
 what?

ROSS:
 you're nose is bleeding!

RACHEL:
 oh god.   this-this happened when my grandfather died. it's ugh! sorry.   oh, okay, so i'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?

ROSS:
 umm 

RACHEL:
 sorry. sorry.

ROSS:
 okay, i uh, i can't see you anymore.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i know. it's ridiculous! i can't see you either. 

 i think you'll find this room more to your liking.

CHANDLER:
 okay, great. 

 

CHANDLER:
 half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!

MONICA:
 we're switching rooms again.

CHANDLER:
 what? why?

MONICA:
 this is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.

 our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.

MONICA:
  second?

CHANDLER:
 uh-huh. 

MONICA:
 chandler!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and i'm not gonna let 'em! and we're not a couple of suckers!

CHANDLER:
 i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so i can watch- 

MONICA:
 okay, this one i like!

CHANDLER:
  regularly scheduled programming!

MONICA:
 can we turn the tv off? okay? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?

CHANDLER:
 oh, i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun?

MONICA:
 hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!

CHANDLER:
 oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?

MONICA:
 i don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas!

CHANDLER:
 do not speak ill of the dead.

MONICA:
 we're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?

CHANDLER:
 i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom.

MONICA:
 what did you say?

CHANDLER:
 i said, "geez, relax monnnnn."  her nose in an attempt to stop the bleeding and as she hears ross enter, she quickly hides 

RACHEL:
 hi!

ROSS:
 hey. rachel, i-i-i've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and i really, i just have to get it out.

RACHEL:
 okay, what's up?

ROSS:
 okay, y'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i told you to give emily whatever she wants.

ROSS:
 and while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants 

RACHEL:
 yeah?

ROSS:
 is for me not to see you anymore.

RACHEL:
 that's crazy! you can't do that! what are you going to tell her?  

ROSS:
 it's awful i know, i mean, i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work. and i do, i have to make this marriage work. i have too. but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.

RACHEL:
 ohh! lucky me! oh my god! that is good news, ross! i think that's the best news i've heard since le poo died!

ROSS:
 you have no idea what a nightmare this has been. this is so hard.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, really? is it ross? yeah? okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.

ROSS:
 what are you doing?

RACHEL:
 storming out!

ROSS:
 rachel, this is your apartment.

RACHEL:
 yeah, well that's how mad i am!! commercial break  throws his bag down and sits down on one of the leather chairs, but he sits on something 

CHANDLER:
 damn rollos!

JOEY:
 hey, you're back!

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 how was your conference?

CHANDLER:
 it was terrible. i fought with  entire time. are you kidding with this? 

JOEY:
 oh, so your weekend was a total bust?

CHANDLER:
 uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 hey, you're back too!

MONICA:
 yeah. umm, chandler can i talk to you outside for a second?

JOEY:
 hey, how was your chef thing?

MONICA:
 oh, it was awful.  appreciate really good food.

CHANDLER:
 well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.

MONICA:
 chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 monica.  

MONICA:
 okay, i'd like to know how much the room was because i'd like to pay my half.

CHANDLER:
 okay, fine, $300.

MONICA:
 300 dollars?!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!

MONICA:
 urghh!!

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 chandler stole a twenty from my purse!

JOEY:
 nooooo!!! y'know what? now that i think about it, i constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!  

ROSS:
 you should've seen the look on her face. i don't want rachel to hate me! i don't know what to do.

JOEY:
 you want my advice?

ROSS:
 yes! please!

JOEY:
 you're not gonna like it.

ROSS:
 that's okay.

JOEY:
 you got married to fast.

ROSS:
 that's not advice!

JOEY:
 i told ya.

ROSS:
 i'm going to the bathroom. 

JOEY:
 man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, i couldn't do it. 

 yeah, me either.

MONICA:
 maybe i could do it.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hi, rach.

CHANDLER:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 look, i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know, i've been obsessing about it all day and i'd just love not to talk about it. all right?

JOEY:
 i-i-i don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, ross is right back there. 

RACHEL:
 that's not ross!

PHOEBE:
 oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though.

CHANDLER:
 okay, ross is in the bathroom.

RACHEL:
 oh my god, its happening. it's already started. i'm kip.

JOEY:
 hey, you're not kip!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 who cares? you're rachel! 

CHANDLER:
 kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.

JOEY:
 oh, that poor bastard.

RACHEL:
 see? yeah, you told me the story. he and monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? he got phased out!

MONICA:
 you're not gonna be phased out!

RACHEL:
 well, of course i am! it's not gonna happen to ross! he's your brother.  someone had to leave the group. i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go.

PHOEBE:
 ehh!!

RACHEL:
 honey, come on! you live far away! you're not related. you lift right out. 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 hey, mr. bing. that uh, hotel you stayed at called. said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.

CHANDLER:
 yes that was mine.

JOEY:
 'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.

CHANDLER:
 yes that would have made more sense.

JOEY:
 y'know, i-i don't even feel like i know you anymore man! all right, look, i'm just gonna ask you this one time. and whatever you say, i'll believe ya.  you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!  

RACHEL:
 phoebe?  lifting out thing. 

PHOEBE:
 come where?

RACHEL:
 wherever i go. come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.

PHOEBE:
 okay, but try and get joey too.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh, sure!   forever.

ROSS:
 hi.

RACHEL:
 hi. what are you doing here? isn't this against the rules?

ROSS:
 i talked to monica, look, i'm the one who made the choice. i'm the one who's making things change, so i should be the one to y'know, step back.

RACHEL:
 oh, ross

ROSS:
 no, no, it's okay. really. they're plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king. so is, is that better?

RACHEL:
 no, it's not better. i still don't get to see you.

ROSS:
 well, what-what would you do? rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?

RACHEL:
 well, for starters i would've said the right name at my wedding!

ROSS:
 i can't believe this is happening.

RACHEL:
 i know.

ROSS:
 i am so sorry.

RACHEL:
 i know that too.

JOEY:
  to interrupt but umm, phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something. 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 hi.

CHANDLER:
 i just came over to drop offnothing. so that weekend kinda sucked, huh?

MONICA:
 yeah, it did.

CHANDLER:
 so, i guess this is over.

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.

MONICA:
 why, exactly?

CHANDLER:
 because of the weekend, we had a fight.

MONICA:
 chandler that's crazy! if you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanohhh!  

CHANDLER:
 so, this isn't over?

MONICA:
  move on! it's nothing to freak out about.

CHANDLER:
 really? okay. great!

MONICA:
 ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 i'm afraid so.

CHANDLER:
 okay.   

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 oh hey, monica, i heard you saw donald trump at your convention.

MONICA:
 yeah, i saw him waiting for an elevator. 

MONICA:
 hey, rach, can i borrow your eyelash curler, i think i lost mine.

RACHEL:
 yeah, it's in there.  

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 joey, can i talk to you for a second?  

JOEY:
 oohh!! ohh! oh-oh-oh! oh-oh!!   

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 yes, but you cannot tell anyone! no one knows!

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 in london!!! 

CHANDLER:
 the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

JOEY:
 but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!  

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no-no! you can't!

MONICA:
 please? please?! we just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? just promise you won't tell. 

JOEY:
 all right! man, this is unbelievable! i mean, it's great, but

MONICA:
 i know, it's great! 

JOEY:
 aww, i don't want to see that! 

PHOEBE:
 we're so stupid! do you know what's going on in there? they're trying to take joey! ending credits  

PHOEBE:
 the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe. and if you win, you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, "hi, phoebe!"

MONICA:
 oh that's cute! we really all enjoyed it. but y'know, it doesn't count.

PHOEBE:
 count for what?

MONICA:
 count in our heads as-as good madlibs. 

JOEY:
 i guess i'm done.

CHANDLER:
 fun's over!

MONICA:
 wait-wait, guys! if-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!

RACHEL:
 uh-huh!

JOEY:
 i think i'm gonna take-off.

JOEY:
  under my roof!

MONICA:
 what?!

JOEY:
 look, just because i know about you two, doesn't mean i like looking at it.

CHANDLER:
 aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?

JOEY:
 well, i'm sorry if i'm not a middle-aged black woman!   and i'm also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition! okay, look, if i have to pretend i don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about. 

 okay.

MONICA:
 sorry.

CHANDLER:
 sorry.  

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
   

JOEY:
 i can still hear you! opening credits  

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hello!

MONICA:
 hey, what's that?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. can you believe it?! a year ago i didn't even have a family, and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud.  

PHOEBE:
 eeeee- -ohh!! god! 

JOEY:
 argh-argh!! 

PHOEBE:
 yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? doesn't she know me but at all! plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  that didn't happen, i made that up!

ROSS:
 

 oh, ross? ross! you can't put up flyers in here.

ROSS:
 how come? everybody else does.

 you can't.

MONICA:
 what is that?

ROSS:
 oh, umm, i'm just getting rid of a couple of things.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 yes, yes it is! no, but it's good it'semily thinks we should get all new stuff. stuff that's just ours, together. y'know brand new.

MONICA:
 so basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-rachel-ever-used sale.

ROSS:
 touched. used. sat on. sleep on.

 i'll take it all.

JOEY:
 hey, ross, you're okay with that?

ROSS:
 look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, i'm sure everything will be fine.

CHANDLER:
 okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?

ROSS:
 after what i did? can you blame her?

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! you got off easy! when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green. 

JOEY:
  furniture has got rachel coodies?

MONICA:
 now calm down joey.

JOEY:
 no! everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? emily won't let ross see rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i hate this. everything's changing.

CHANDLER:
 yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence

MONICA:
 look, i'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves. are you cool with that?

JOEY:
 no! but y'know, i'm an actor, i'll act cool.  

RACHEL:
 ohh, whoa god! storage rooms give me the creeps! monica, come on please hurry up honey! please? 

MONICA:
 rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron.

RACHEL:
 i want the little round waffles.

MONICA:
 all right.  can of-of bug bomb. i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison? 

RACHEL:
 okay, y'know what? i'll-i'll have toast!  

RACHEL:
 arghhhh!!!!!! 

MONICA:
 oh my god! fog him! fog him!   

PHOEBE:
 i don't know what i'm gonna do about this coat.

JOEY:
 i'll take it!

PHOEBE:
 that might work! 

JOEY:
 ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  what do you think?

CHANDLER:
 you're on in 5 ms. minnelli. 

ROSS:
  okay? i'm totally on board. i love you too, all righty. bye. 

JOEY:
 what's the matter ross?

ROSS:
 nothing. oh, actually, great news! i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like i'm moving to a new apartment. woo-hoo!

PHOEBE:
 why?

ROSS:
 well, her thought is, and i agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other.

JOEY:
 that's way uptown! that's like three trains away!  which is great! i love to ride that rail!

CHANDLER:
 so you're really okay with this?

ROSS:
 yes! yes! i mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, i'll get so much done on the commute. i-i've been given the gift of time!

CHANDLER:
 now that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum. 

JOEY:
 now he's movin'? man, what is emily doing to him?   ow!! he's not even here!!! 

RACHEL:
 you guys! you guys!

MONICA:
 we were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!

RACHEL:
 it was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! he was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!

MONICA:
 and he came at us with an axe, so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!

RACHEL:
  yeti ass!

JOEY:
 uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?

RACHEL:
 yeah!

JOEY:
 yeah, you fogged danny.

RACHEL:
 please! we did not fog danny! who's danny?

JOEY:
 dan just moved in downstairs. yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the andes. nice fella. 

MONICA:
 oh he's nice. he's nice! y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!  knocks on his door, which he opens and he has this really bushy beard and long hair. 

 yeah?

RACHEL:
 hi! you might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.

MONICA:
 we're-we're really sorry we fogged you.

 okay.  

RACHEL:
 hi! just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.

 okay.  

 yesss?

RACHEL:
 hi! sorry to bother you, but i don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.

MONICA:
 yeah.

 o-kay! 

MONICA:
 wow! that guy is so rude!

RACHEL:
 really! what is with that guy? i mean you'd forgive me if i fogged you.

MONICA:
 well you did a little bit.

RACHEL:
 oh my god, honey, i'm so sorry!

MONICA:
 i totally forgive you!

RACHEL:
 really?

MONICA:
 yes!  

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 so listen, you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium? 

MONICA:
 crematorium chris? sure!

PHOEBE:
 he says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm, y'know, bring in the next person i know who dies. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god! oh my god, look at these pelts!

MONICA:
 don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.

RACHEL:
 what? uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, i know you're quirky and i get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! not nature, fashion!

PHOEBE:
 this is fashion?!  is fashion?! that's really funny.  phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry russia. i mean, you really thing this looks good?   'cause i do.  has picked a particularly large and apparently heavy box, because he takes a running start 

ROSS:
  bye. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, what is in here? rocks?

ROSS:
 no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.

CHANDLER:
 so, rocks.  

ROSS:
 i'm really gonna miss this apartment. y'know, ben-ben took his first steps right over there. 

JOEY:
 ohh. hey, remember when i ran into this thing   and it kinda knocked me out a little?

ROSS:
 i loved this place! to tell you the truth, i wish i didn't have to move.

JOEY:
 uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?

ROSS:
 well, i mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice

JOEY:
 you do have a choice!! ross, why are you listening to her?! are you, are you crazy?!

ROSS:
 why?

JOEY:
 it's not right what emily wants you to do! she is totally- -owww!! stop pinching me! look, now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right? well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.

ROSS:
 what's going on?

JOEY:
 we all hate emily!

PHOEBE:
 nooo!!

MONICA:
 no, ross, we do not hate emily. we-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.

JOEY:
 yeah!

CHANDLER:
 look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.

JOEY:
 yes! yes! unreasonable!

ROSS:
 unreasonable? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! all right, it's about compromise! do you always like it? no! do you do it? yes! because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! it's real life, okay? it's what grown-ups do! 

PHOEBE:
 i think he's right. you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much. commercial break  

MONICA:
 god, i feel so guilty about ross.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i know.

JOEY:
 i kinda feel like it's my fault. 

CHANDLER:
 kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.

JOEY:
 well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! 

CHANDLER:
 well, i think it's very brave what you said. 

PHOEBE:
 all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places.  

CHANDLER:
 pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?

PHOEBE:
 well, i've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. okay, i admit it! i love this coat! okay, iit's the best thing i've ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley!   remember phil huntley? he was fine!  shopping bags and goes to her mailbox. danny has shaved his beard and cut his hair, rachel 

RACHEL:
 hi!

 so you like the short hair better.

RACHEL:
 what? yetii mean danny?

 i had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.

RACHEL:
 oh. listen, i'm so sorry. i would, i would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so. y'know.

 absolutely. some people are just into appearances.

RACHEL:
 

 that's cool. cool. 

RACHEL:
 what? hey! no-no-no! this not cool! you don't even know me!

 come on, you got the shopping bags and the sack's catalog. 

RACHEL:
 so from that you think you've got me all figured out? well, you don't! y'know i-i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!

 do you?

RACHEL:
 well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with capri pants.

 okay. 

RACHEL:
 and stop saying that! i hate that!

 okay!  

RACHEL:
 fine! i judged you. i made a snap judgement. but you did it too! and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! you can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! what does that say about you?

 the pizza-place across the street any good?

RACHEL:
 what?!

 i'm hungry. wanna get some pizza? you can keep yelling if there's more.

RACHEL:
 okay. okay.

 stop saying that. i hate that.  

CHANDLER:
 uh, ross?

PHOEBE:
 are you still mad at us?

ROSS:
 yep.

PHOEBE:
 oh good! because we have an "i'm sorry" song.

ROSS:
 y'know what? i'm really not in the mood.

JOEY:
 look, ross, i feel really bad. i mean, you're going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, we are so sorry.

PHOEBE:
  

JOEY:
 look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.

MONICA:
 whatever you decide, whatever you do.

PHOEBE:
 okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!

ROSS:
 look, this is hard enough! i really need you guys right now.

PHOEBE:
 yes! exactly! and that's why 

MONICA:
 why don't you come over tonight? and i'll make you favorite dinner.

ROSS:
 okay. thanks you guys. pheebs are you wearing fur?

PHOEBE:
 okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like i'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat! 

JOEY:
 hey, y'know ross, i think i kinda understand why i kinda lost it today.

ROSS:

JOEY:
 yeah you see umm, well, i'm an actor. right? so i gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? see what i'm saying? i gotta lot of balls in the air.   y'know what i mean? it's tough! guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone

ROSS:

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 hey, look at you! where have you been?

RACHEL:
 oh, i went to have pizza. with danny.

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 that yeti is one smooth talker.

MONICA:
 i hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.

RACHEL:
 yeah, y'know i-i think i'm just gonna hang out in my room.

 no! why?

RACHEL:
 come on you guys! listen, if emily knew i was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. it's okay, i really i don't mind.

ROSS:
 wait! wait! wait! y'know what? just stay. please? it uh it would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.

RACHEL:
 ross, i

JOEY:
 rachel please!!! just have dinner with us!!! 

RACHEL:
 okay. okay. joey, it's okay. settle down.

JOEY:
 all right, i-i'm sorry. i'm sorry. you see rach i'm an actor 

ROSS:
 hey! hey, look! ugly naked guy's back! 

RACHEL:
 i haven't seen him in so long!

PHOEBE:
 oh god, i really missed that fat bastard! 

MONICA:
 wow, this is so weird. i just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.

JOEY:
 it's almost as if he knew. 

MONICA:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, there-there she is!

ROSS:

ROSS:

ROSS:
  okay?

ROSS:
 emily that's ridiculous. look, i'm-i'm moving for you, i'm cutting friends out of my life for you. please, just get on the plane and come to new york. okay, you'll see you're the only person i want to be with.

 i'll feel better when i'm there, and i can know where you are all the time.

ROSS:
 well, you can't know where i am all the time. look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.

 you're right.

ROSS:
 so, can you trust me? 

 no.  

JOEY:
 i think it's going okay. looks like he's smiling.

MONICA:
 how can you tell? you can only see the back of his head!

JOEY:
 you can totally tell! here look, watch me.   smile! frown. smile! frown.   smile!  alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back 

ROSS:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 are you looking at naked tribe's women?

JOEY:
 no, look. 

CHANDLER:
 that's a pig.

JOEY:
 i know, i know, but look at the knobs on her. 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

ROSS:
 emily's cousin kicked me out!

CHANDLER:
 what?! 

JOEY:
 why?

ROSS:
 well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.

CHANDLER:
 how can he do that? didn't you sign a lease?

ROSS:
 who needs a lease when it's family!

JOEY:
 hey, you can stay with us! we'll take care of ya!

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah! absolutely! anything you need man! but you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!

JOEY:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 you got it.

JOEY:
 okay.

ROSS:
 thanks you guys, i really appreciate this. all right, i'm gonna get packing again. man, i've been moving around so much i'm beginning to feel like a nomad. 

ROSS:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 he thought you said gonad.  opening credits   

 wow, monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, i'd have a tough time making a living.

MONICA:
 oh, larry.

PHOEBE:
 umm, do health inspectors work on commission? 

 no, bribes. 

PHOEBE:
 it's okay to laugh right?

 yeah, i was just kidding.

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

 i'll check the kitchen floors.

MONICA:
 okay, knock yourself out, larry. 

PHOEBE:
 yum-my!

MONICA:
 larry?

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah! i'd let him check out my kitchen floors.

  chef's hat, and that is a section 5 violation.

MONICA:
 uh, look, larry honey, umm, i wrote the book on section 5 and i know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.

 and where is your hat?

MONICA:
 it's in the kitchen, i'll go get it.  

 ahh that's the 2 points.

PHOEBE:
 hey, you should really read that book you wrote.  the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. you can have your own health inspector detective show!

 oh, i don't know about that.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but then i can be you sidekick vunda.

 maybe uh, vunda could give me her number and i can ask her to dinner sometime.

PHOEBE:
 okay, she would love that! y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.

 i-i'll call ya.

PHOEBE:
 okay.  

PHOEBE:
 he's so funny!  

MONICA:
 thanks.

RACHEL:
 thank you. 

MONICA:
 hmm?

RACHEL:
 how's ross doing? y'know since all the emily stuff.

MONICA:
 he's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try

RACHEL:
 oh, honey, please, no, i can't get started with all that ross stuff again. i mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. and besides y'know, i don't, i don't go for guys right after they get divorced.

MONICA:
 right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married. 

 

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 i don't know! he hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. i see him in the hallway, we flirt, i'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.

 

RACHEL:
 hi danny! 

 uh, actually, actually, i'm having a party at my place on saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.

MONICA:
 ohh, fun!

RACHEL:
 ohh, great!

 yeah, i'm really looking forward to it.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

 okay, see ya. 

MONICA:
 well, i guess we won't be warming his house.

RACHEL:
  because he wants me to ask him out.

MONICA:
 and you're not gonna do that.

RACHEL:
 that's right! 'cause that would give him the control! so now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole i've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. blew up in his face, didn't it?

MONICA:
 so-so there is no party.

RACHEL:
 no, there's a party. there's a party. but the power, that is still up for grabs. you follow me?

MONICA:
 i think so. se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.

RACHEL:
 exactly.  

JOEY:
 ross?

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 oh, yeah i know, i know, it's a lot of boxes, but again i really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 hey, all right!

ROSS:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh, the tears are real.

PHOEBE:
  

PHOEBE:

 oh, will you mind if i wash up? because i came straight from work and who knows where these babies 

PHOEBE:
   

 

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
   

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
  all i heard through 4 years of college was 

JOEY:
 dude, you should've gone out once and a while.

CHANDLER:
 i hate this thing!

JOEY:
 come on, chandler, ross is our friend. he needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some tv in the fort! 

RACHEL:
 oh, hi danny.

 hey guys, i just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.

MONICA:
 oh, thanks! we'll try to stop by.

RACHEL:
 uh, actually, i think i'm gonna be busy.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 okay.

 take care. 

RACHEL:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 what one? you wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!

RACHEL:
 yeah, but he waited until the last minute! so if i said yes, he would know i had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. i said, "no!" which puts me right back in the driver seat.

MONICA:
 great. so the ball is in his court?

RACHEL:
 ball? there is no ball.  

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 sorry. 

JOEY:
 ahhhhhhhhhh   this may take a while to explain, so center this on you screen and place your hands about a foot apart with your fingers together and pointing straight up. now take you fingers and point them at the other hand and making a 90-degree angle with each of your hands and the first knuckle counting up from the wrist. now take your right hand, no your other right  pointing at your wrist. now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. that's ross 'quiet down' maneuver. well, there is an accompanying face, but 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 hey! wanna play some foosball? please?

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

JOEY:
 no-no, no! we have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'cause of all the boxes. come on! 

JOEY:
 all right, i have one question. what is the deal with this?  

CHANDLER:
 bye-bye little puppet joey hand?

JOEY:
 no, the quiet down thing!

CHANDLER:
 you mean this. 

JOEY:
 um-hmm! look, i-i-i don't know how much more of this i can take! did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with some show about bugs! my god! what if that had been porn?

CHANDLER:
  ross! i survived college with him!

JOEY:
 all right, i guess i can hold out a little longer. let's have a game.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no!

JOEY:
 yes!!

ROSS:
  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 oh monica that was the best thanksgiving dinner ever! i think you killed us.

ROSS:
 i couldn't possibly eat another bite. 

JOEY:
 i need something sweet.

PHOEBE:
 does anyone wanna watch tv?

 yeah, sure.  

PHOEBE:
 monica your remote doesn't work.

MONICA:
 phoebe, you have to lift it and point.

PHOEBE:
 oh. aw, forget it.

RACHEL:
 yeah, you know what we should all do? we should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.

JOEY:
 ooh-ooh, i! i am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.

MONICA:
 that's very nice.

CHANDLER:
 that's sweet, joey.

JOEY:
 yeah, the other day i was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. oh! which reminds me, i'm also thankful for thongs.   opening credits  

JOEY:
 i mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. i mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! and the way they play with your mind! is it there? is it not there?

CHANDLER:
 are you aware that you're still talking?

MONICA:
 is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?

ROSS:
 huh, i don't know what to pick. am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? hmm.

PHOEBE:
 wow! see, and i didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.

ROSS:
 i'm sorry. it's just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever.

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no! i am the king of bad thanksgivings. you can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.

RACHEL:
 oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?

ROSS:
 oh god, no.

JOEY:
 oh, come on! i wanna hear it! it wouldn't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out!

CHANDLER:
 it's a tradition, like the parade. if the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.  thanksgiving 1978  

 now chandler dear, just because your father and i are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. it just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.

 more turkey mr. chandler?  present day 

ROSS:
 you're right. yours is worse. you are the king of bad thanksgivings.

PHOEBE:
 i don't know about that. i've got one that's worse.

CHANDLER:
 really? worse than, "more turkey mr. chandler?"

PHOEBE:
 oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? yes, mine's worse! thanksgiving 1862  union soldier.   

 more bandages! more bandages! please, can i get some more bandages in here! this man is dying outside the tent. when the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping out  oh no. present day 

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 oh, this life! oh okay no, chandler's is worse.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 of course you don't sweetie. you're brand new.

RACHEL:
 i know monica's worst thanksgiving.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 well then help me get it off! plus, it smells really bad in here.

PHOEBE:
 well, of course it smells really bad. you have your head up a dead animal.  onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey, did you get the turkey bastedoh my god! oh my god!   who is that?

JOEY:

MONICA:
 what-what are you doing? is this supposed to be funny?

PHOEBE:
 no, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.

MONICA:
 well, get it off now!

JOEY:
 i can't! it-it's stuck!

MONICA:
 well, i don't care! that-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!

ROSS:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh wait! that can't be the one rachel's talking about. she didn't even know that happened. so which one was it?

 which one?

MONICA:
 umm, i-i really don't want to tell this story.

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what thanksgiving is all about. y'know, for me anyway. and of course, the indians.

MONICA:

 well, you know that my parents are out of town and chip was going to come over

 yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.

ROSS:

 i know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!

 i know, i know. and oh, and this time chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song! 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 you just, you look so different! terrific! that dress! that body!

ROSS:

RACHEL:
  for calling you fat! he was just drooling all over you. that must've felt so great!

MONICA:
 well it didn't!

RACHEL:
 what?!

MONICA:
 yeah, i mean yeah, i look great. yeah, i feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! blah, blah, blah! y'know i still don't feel like i got him back, y'know? i just want to humiliate him. i wanna, i want him to be like naked and then i'm going to point at him and laugh!

RACHEL:
 okay, that we may be able to do.

MONICA:
 how?

RACHEL:
 well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.

MONICA:
 what?! i mean, i didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that i can give my flower to someone like him!

RACHEL:
 okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! you're just gonna make him think that you are.

MONICA:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 and when he's naked i can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!

RACHEL:
 then, you will definitely get him back!

MONICA:
 okay, so how do i make him think i wanna have sex with him?

RACHEL:
 okay, oh, here's what you do. just act like everything around you turns you on.

MONICA:
 what do you mean?

RACHEL:
 well, like anything can be sexy. like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!  my cheek! and-and if i feel a little hot, i can just dab myself with it. or i can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while i talk to him.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah? okay! good, good, because he's coming. he's coming.  hey, what's up? 

CHANDLER:
 monica, i was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.

MONICA:
 umm, i'd love too!   ooh, i love macaroni and cheese. i love-i love the way this box feels against my cheek.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 boy, i love carrots! oh!   sometimes i like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while i talk to you.  and-and-and y'know if i get really hot umm, i-i like to pick up this knife   and-and umm, i-i put the cold steal against umm,  exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the

MONICA:
 oh yes! i have it right here, on ice!  

  

MONICA:
 what?! what is it?

 you brought a carrot.

CHANDLER:

 this isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.

RACHEL:
 you brought a carrot?!

 oh my god! there's a toe in my kitchen.

MONICA:
 god, i'm sorry! i'll go back and get it!

 it's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.

CHANDLER:
 without my toe?! i need my toe!

MONICA:
 wait, no-no-no, i can go really fast! dad, give me the keys to your porsche!

 oh, i'm not falling for that one! present day 

CHANDLER:
 that's why i lost my toe?! because i called you fat?!

MONICA:
 i didn't mean to cut it off. it was an accident.

CHANDLER:
 that's why for an entire year people called me sir limps-a-lot?!

MONICA:
 i'm sorry! it wasn't your whole toe!

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 oh-oh, yeah-yeah, i bet all the sex makes it easier!

CHANDLER:
 well, yeah actually.

MONICA:
 we'll try to be more careful okay? it's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.

CHANDLER:
 i know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.

MONICA:
 we are! help us!

CHANDLER:
 help!

JOEY:
 all right! but, 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 honey that sounds like fun.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! ooh, you should come with me! oh yeah, then i'd have someone to sit with!

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 what's wrong buddy?

ROSS:
 someone at work ate my sandwich!

CHANDLER:
 well, what did the police say?

ROSS:
 my thanksgiving leftover sandwich. i can't believe someone ate it!

CHANDLER:
 ross, it's just a sandwich!

ROSS:
 just a sandwich? look, i am 30 years old, i'm about to be divorced twice and i just got evicted! that sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!

MONICA:
 okay, look, i-i have enough stuff for one more sandwich, i mean i was going to eat it myself, but 

ROSS:
  can't believe someone ate it!! i mean, look, i left a note and everything.  

CHANDLER:
  lunch, who? ross geller's lunch, please don't take me. okay?

JOEY:
 i'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.

PHOEBE:
 okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? you gotta scare people off. i learned that living on the street.

ROSS:
 really?! so what would you say pheebs? stuff like uh, "keep your mitts off my grub?"

CHANDLER:
 say ross, when you picture phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie?

PHOEBE:
 okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.  

 whoa! ohh!!

MONICA:
 phoebe, you are a bad ass!

PHOEBE:
 someday i'll, tell you about the time i stabbed the cop.

MONICA:
 phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 well, he stabbed me first!! 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay.

RACHEL:
 so pheebs, what is the book about?

PHOEBE:
 i thought you said you read it in high school.

RACHEL:
 well yeah, but then i remembered i started it and there was this pep rally and i was, i was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?

PHOEBE:
 okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england. which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff's character. i totally get symbolism.

 how would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here 

RACHEL:
 umm, well i would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.

 well, that's sort of a given, but yes. anyone else?

RACHEL:
 oh-oh-oh, symbolism! and uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which i think is-is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff's character.

 excellent! what rachel has shrewdly observed here

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 well, honey that was pretty obvious.

PHOEBE:
 well how would you know?! you didn't even read it!

 what do you think? you in the blue shirt.

PHOEBE:
 i think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.

 would ya care to venture one?

PHOEBE:
 would you care to venture one?

 are you just repeating what i'm saying?

PHOEBE:
 are you just repeating what i'm saying?

 all right, let's move on.

PHOEBE:
 okay then. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!

RACHEL:
 be-because i didn't want him to think i was stupid! i mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

ROSS:
 phoebe! you're note, amazing! not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. yeah, a guy called me mental! mental geller, yeah, i always wanted a cool nickname like that.

MONICA:
 yeah, the best you got in high school was wet pants geller.

ROSS:
 that was the water fountain! okay?! anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, i'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  give me that coffee! now!  

 god, this was really fun! i've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.

JOEY:
 so you uh, still wondering?

 no, we just went out.

JOEY:
 you're smart. i like that.  his keys, chandler and monica quickly jump up from making out in the living room and run to chandler's bedroom. the apartment has about 20 candles burning all over the place. joey 

 oh, candles!  camera? oh my god! 

JOEY:
 oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!

 i can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! 

JOEY:
 hiya.

RACHEL:
 joey, is what she just said ummoh my god.  you were actually gonna  

CHANDLER:
 what is going on here?

RACHEL:
 and with chandler in the next room. what are you, what are you sick? 

JOEY:
 i'm joey. i mean, i'm disgusting. i make low-budget adult films.   commercial break  

JOEY:
 you guys promised you'd be more careful! i mean, come on! the good joey name is being dragged through the mud here!

MONICA:
 we're so sorry.

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 well, i'm telling everyone about you! that's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!

CHANDLER:
 no-no, wait! there's got to be a better explanation. you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your 

JOEY:
 yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place?

CHANDLER:
 ohi don't know.

JOEY:
 well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!

MONICA:
 okay, just wait, please. i promise we'll come up with something. just give us a little more time.

JOEY:
 all right. hey, but it better make me look really, really good.   oh, and another thing, the video camera? nice!!  

 umm, ross. may i have a word with you?

ROSS:
 yeah, of course, donald.

 we've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.

ROSS:
 what?!

 threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.

ROSS:
 

 we want you to speak to a psychiatrist. 

ROSS:
 oh no, you-you don't understand. ugh, this is so silly. umm, this is all because of a sandwich.

 

ROSS:
 yeah. you see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; i call it the moist maker. anyway, i-i put my sandwich in the fridge over here 

 

ROSS:
 what?

 i-i'm sorry. i, i-i-i believe i ate that.

ROSS:
 you ate my sandwich?

 it was a simple mistake. it could happen to anyone.

ROSS:
  sandwich with a moist maker?

 no.

ROSS:
 do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?

 there may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.

ROSS:
 

 now-now calm down. come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.

ROSS:
 

 well, it was quite large. i-i-i-i-i had to throw most of it away.

ROSS:
 you-you-you-you  

ROSS:
  

ROSS:
 my sandwich!!!!!!  

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 you didn't read this one either?!

RACHEL:
 well, i was gonna, but i accidentally read something else.

PHOEBE:
 what?

RACHEL:
 vogue! hey, so tell me about this jane eyre woman.

PHOEBE:
 no! you should've read it yourself!

RACHEL:
 come on phoebe! dont be such a goodie-goodie!

PHOEBE:
 fine! okay, all right, so jane eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. she's a cyborg. 

RACHEL:
 a cyborg?! isn't that like a robot?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.

  everybody think about jane eyre?

PHOEBE:
 umm, rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.

 well, go ahead rachel.

RACHEL:
 uh, thank you phoebe. umm, well, what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.

 if you're talking about feminism, i think you're right.

RACHEL:
 yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey. okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, i thought that i would give you just a little preview. 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 i know.  

CHANDLER:
 ross?

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 ross, are you okay?

ROSS:
 i'm fine! i saw a psychiatrist at work today.

MONICA:
 why?!

ROSS:
 on account of my rage.

CHANDLER:
 which i may say, right now, is out of control.

ROSS:
 he gave me a pill for it.

MONICA:
 a pill?

ROSS:
 uh-huh. well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. and i thought was a good idea so, i took it.

MONICA:
 wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?

CHANDLER:
 and you're okay with that?

ROSS:
 i don't know. it's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely don't care about my sandwich. 

RACHEL:
  let me go on and on like that!

PHOEBE:
  eyre to robocop. 

RACHEL:
 that was not funny!

PHOEBE:
 well, i snapped! okay? you weren't taking the class seriously.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, come on! what is the big deal? i thought this was going to be something we could do together! y'know, i thought it would be fun!

PHOEBE:
 well, yeah! fun is good, but y'know i also wanted to learn. y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school.

RACHEL:
 ohh. oh, so you really wanted to learn. yeah, y'know, pheebs i just wanted to have fun. ohh, you know who you should go with? 

MONICA:
 

 monica, you asked the question.   starts going through the mail. while doing this, monica's picture falls out. he bends over to pick it up and gasps. while he's staring at the picture, rachel decides to come over 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 oh no-no-no! no-no-no-no-no-no-no!

RACHEL:
 you get away from me!! you sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 joey has got a secret peephole!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 yes! he has a naked picture of monica! he takes naked pictures of us! and then he eats chicken and looks at them!  

RACHEL:
 look! 

ROSS:
  

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 all right, wait! just wait. everybody just calm down. okay? let's give our friend joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!

JOEY:
 no! i am not a pervert! okay? it's just i just kinda

CHANDLER:
 all right, look! look. i think i can explain this. 

JOEY:
 thank you!

CHANDLER:
 joey's a sex addict. 

JOEY:
 what?!!   no i'm not!!

MONICA:
 it's okay! it's good! it's good. it's a disease!

JOEY:
 no! no! i am not a sex addict!

MONICA:
 yes you are! that's the only way to explain all this stuff!

JOEY:
 no it isn't! no, it's not. because you can also explain it with the truth!

RACHEL:
 well, what is the truth?

ROSS:
 yeah, what's going on?

PHOEBE:
 what's going on?

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?

MONICA:
 oh no!

ROSS:
 you slept with my sister?

JOEY:
 uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in london.

ROSS:
 this is not good for my rage. 

RACHEL:
 monica, is this true?

JOEY:
 of course it's true! how else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?

MONICA:
 yes it's true.

RACHEL:
 okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?

JOEY:
 ahhoy! that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london. right monica?

MONICA:
 i guess i wanted to keep it 

ROSS:
 my god monica!!

CHANDLER:
 are you sure joe? are you sure you're not just a sex addict?

JOEY:
 no! if anyone's a sex addict here, it's monica! yeah. yeah. she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!

PHOEBE:
 so that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.

JOEY:
 that makes sense!

RACHEL:
 and the video camera?

JOEY:
 uhh, monica?

MONICA:
 i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey.

JOEY:
 but sadly i could not be enticed.

ROSS:
 unbelievable! i mean you really kept joey's underwear?! why? why would you do that?!

MONICA:
 i'm monica. i'm disgusting. i stalk guys and keep their underpants.

JOEY:
 well, i think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. eh? all right, now, i'm going to get back to my bucket. i'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.  ending credits  

PHOEBE:
 i really thought you making a good point. i mean y'know, until you got cut off.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 the only reason you're doing this to joey is because you're bored. okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.

ROSS:
 i am not unemployed. i'm on sabbatical!

JOEY:
 come on look guys, don't fight.

ROSS:
 and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.

CHANDLER:
 oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?

ROSS:
 if it does? then you're an amazing friend of mine.

JOEY:
 hey-hey guys, hey! how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball? huh? i'll go unhook the smoke detectors!

ROSS:
 how about we settle this right now!  no one's going to the game. ha-ha-ha!

CHANDLER:
 i paid for those tickets!

ROSS:
 no you didn't. you said you would, but you never did!

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah!   

 so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here   forgets the camera!

JOEY:
 oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.

CHANDLER:
 when did that happen to you?!

JOEY:
 don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picturei didn't have my camera!

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah. first off all, chasing the churo guy isn't jogging.

 oh, this is so good  takes some on her finger and feeds it to danny. then takes a little more and does it again. meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. then they pick up a part of it 

 oh, damn! i got it on my pants.

 here, i'll get it.  thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his 

 we'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.

 yep. 

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and

 oh great! that special bond again! why do women have such a problem with the fact that i'm close with my sister?

RACHEL:
 well, okay, look. i don't know, listen, i don't know what's going on here but let's

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 no-no, they're not very nice people.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day!!

JOEY:
 yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that i finished it. and uh, i think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if i could hear it. so would you guys read it for me?

MONICA:

ROSS:
 

JOEY:

ROSS:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 happy new year.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 you too!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 so did that do anything for ya?  opening credits 

ROSS:
 y'know what? i'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!

RACHEL:
 but your divorce isn't even final yet.

ROSS:
 just the one divorce in '99! y'know what, i am gonna be happy this year. i am gonna make myself happy.

CHANDLER:
 do you want us to leave the room, or?

ROSS:
 everyday i am gonna do one thing that i haven't done before. that my friends is my new year's resolution.

PHOEBE:
 ooh! that's a good one! mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

CHANDLER:
 that's good one too, pheebs. now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.

PHOEBE:
 maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane.

MONICA:
 she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.

ROSS:
 in fact, i'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. eh, y'know what, better yet? a week.

CHANDLER:
 i'll take that bet my friend. and you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  starts right now!

JOEY:
 all right, my new year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.

ROSS:
 ohh.

PHOEBE:
 really?! how come?

JOEY:
 well, y'know those special skills i have listed on my resume? i would love it would be great if one of those was true.

PHOEBE:
 do you want me to teach you? i'm a great teacher.

JOEY:
 really? who-who have you taught?

PHOEBE:
 well, i taught me and i love me.

JOEY:
 yeah that'd be great! thanks pheebs!

RACHEL:
 op, look! claire forgot her glasses! and she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, i hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what i'm talking about.

MONICA:
 hey rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.

RACHEL:
 i don't gossip! 

RACHEL:
 well, maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean i'm a gossip. i mean, would you call ted kopel a gossip?

MONICA:
 well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, i would.

RACHEL:
 what? they were like this!   in one pointing up and one pointing down with her hands by pointing up with one hand and   

 i'll see you tomorrow.

ROSS:
 okay!  

 hey!

ROSS:
 i just asked that girl out.

CHANDLER:
 nice!

JOEY:
 nice!! yeah! is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?

ROSS:
 yes it is. see.  

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 that's right, uh, elizabeth hornswoggle.

CHANDLER:
 horn-swoggle.

JOEY:
 you all right chandler? is there something funny about that name?

CHANDLER:
 no. no, i just think that maybe i-i'd heard it somewhere before.  

JOEY:
 oh really! where? somewhere funny i'd bet!  

ROSS:
 hi, pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 hey! 

ROSS:
 oh-oh, guess what? i-i have a date with elizabeth   hornswoggle.

PHOEBE:
 hornswoggle? 

ROSS:
 all right, see you later.

JOEY:
 see ya! all right pheebs, i am ready for my first lesson. 

PHOEBE:
 okay.  guitar! first you learn here,  

JOEY:
 umm, okay.

PHOEBE:
 okay, lesson one: chords. now, i don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, i-i-i made up names for the way my hand looks while i'm doing them. 

 for this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. so if you want to see    so then, this is bear claw. okay, umm, turkey leg and old lady. 

CHANDLER:
 what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. y'know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular. 

PHOEBE:
 hey everybody, rachel was so good today. she didn't gossip at all.

RACHEL:
 i didnt! even when i found outumm, all right, well let's just say i found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. 

JOEY:
 hey, pheebs! check-check this out.  

PHOEBE:
 ooh, you nailed the old lady! 

JOEY:
 yeah listen so, i thought i was getting better, so on my way home today i stopped by this guitar store and

PHOEBE:
 did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? did you?!

JOEY:
 no.

PHOEBE:
 give me your hands.  gimme it!  learn to play guitar?

JOEY:
 yes!

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 i think they're very nice.

MONICA:
 i like 'em.

JOEY:
 yeah! 

MONICA:
 i like them a lot.

CHANDLER:
 that's not what i had in mind! see, people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants. you see, they're very tight.  there's something in that area.  

ROSS:
 oh see, i-i needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and i thought to myself, "wow,  really owned a good smelling pair of pants before." 

CHANDLER:
 oh come on!! 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 you look like a freak.

RACHEL:
 awful, absolutely awful.   

ROSS:

MONICA:
 it's my new year's resolution!

ROSS:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.  starts taking pictures of him and phoebe. they both start to strike a pose with the   

ROSS:
    what is she trying to kill me? it's like a volcano in here! 

 no.

ROSS:
 okay, it must just be me then.  reminds one of a brief explosion of gas. in other words, it sounds like he farted. she has 

ROSS:
 that was just the pants on the couch. umm, hey, do you, do you mind if i use your bathroom?

 no, go ahead.

ROSS:
 thanks.    drops his pants. he exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his legs. he sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. he next grabs a magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he wants it to. so he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one. he jumps up and hops to the sink. he turns on the water and starts to splash some on his 

ROSS:
 

 

ROSS:
 'kay!  

ROSS:
 oh my god! 

PHOEBE:
 tiger!   dragon! iceberg!!  last night?

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 then do iceberg!

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 g-sharp? have you been studying the real names of the chords? 

JOEY:
 what?! i didn't touch a guitar!

PHOEBE:
 no, but you're questioning my method!

JOEY:
 no, i'm not questioning it, i'm saying it's stupid!   what?! 

MONICA:
 thank you. 

PHOEBE:
 y'know none of my other student thought i was stupid.

JOEY:
 your other student, was you!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!

JOEY:
  right here! here! andy cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and the kid's got a guitar!!!!!! 

PHOEBE:
 fine! you go learn from your qualified instructor! but don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play bad, bad leroy brown!!

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh, fine! take his side!   last part of which is something she shouldn't have done, because the phone is already in 

MONICA:
  picks up ben. i'll just tell rachel i'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 arghh!!   commercial break 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 uhh, chandler's not here.

ROSS:
 well, you can help me!

JOEY:
 okay.

ROSS:
 listen, i'm in elizabeth's bathroom

JOEY:
 nice!

ROSS:
 no, i-i got really hot in my leather pants so i took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. look, i-i can't put them back on. i can't!

JOEY:
 oh. that is quite a situation. uh, do you see any like, powder?

ROSS:
 powder! yeah! yeah, i have powder! 

JOEY:
 good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.

ROSS:
 yeah, okay, hold on!  large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. it   they're not coming on man.

JOEY:
 umm, do you see anyoh, vaseline? 

ROSS:
 ohh, i-i see lotion, i have lotion! will that work?

JOEY:
 yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.

ROSS:
 hold on.  spraying the back of his legs with the lotion, and as he applies some to his butt he makes a happy face like he enjoyed that sensation. after using about half the bottle he again tries to pull up his pants, but at the first sign of resistance, his hand slips off of the 

JOEY:
 ross? you okay?

ROSS:
 they're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!

JOEY:
 really?! uhh, what color is it?

ROSS:
 what difference does that make?!

JOEY:
 well, i'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 dude, what am i gonna

JOEY:
  out. 

RACHEL:
 oh, joey, i have such a problem!

JOEY:
 oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. i am putting out fires all over the place.

RACHEL:
 okay. okay. okay. joey, i have got to tell you something!

JOEY:
 what-what is it, what is it?

RACHEL:
 oh my god, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.

JOEY:
 oh no, no-no-no-no! i don't want to know!

RACHEL:
 yes! yes! yes, you do want to know! this is unbelievable!

JOEY:
 i don't care, rach! look, i am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!

RACHEL:
 what? what secrets? you know secrets? what are they?

JOEY:
 and you're not supposed to be gossiping!! 

RACHEL:
 i know, i know! i just can't keep this one in, so i pick up the phone  fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits chandler walks in and sees joey in his 

JOEY:
 i'm not listening to you!  the chicken starts flapping it's wings in protest as chandler holds the chicken inches from joey's face. joey stops yelling and upon opening his eyes sees the chicken, screams,   

 ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. i'm starting to get kinda freaked out.

ROSS:
 all right, i'm coming out. hey, can you turn the lights off.

 no, let's just leave the lights on.  holds them wrapped into a ball in front of his crotch. his legs are covered in the powder 

 oh my god!

ROSS:
 i had a problem. 

JOEY:
 hey, pheebs?

PHOEBE:
 no, i can't talk to you! i don't have a fancy ad in the yellow pages!

JOEY:
 look, pheebs, i just, i wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. and-and i promise, i won't touch a guitar until you say i'm ready.  really think i'm ready?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh!

JOEY:
 wow! cool!  however, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table 

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 no!  

CHANDLER:
 oh my god!

MONICA:
 we heard about your pants, i'm so sorry.

ROSS:
 this year was supposed to be great! but, it's only the second day and i'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!

 no. no, you're not a loser.

ROSS:
 look at me! 

MONICA:
 hey, hey, look. look ross, ben drew a picture of you!   huh? you're-you're a cowboy!

ROSS:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 hey, uh, joey?

JOEY:
 umm?

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 i was frustrated.

CHANDLER:
 it was my racquet.

MONICA:
 i was frustrated with you!

CHANDLER:
 if we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.

MONICA:
 y'know what really bothers me? isit's how-how different you act around them! i mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "i'll see you around, bing!" "not if i see you first, doug!"  gotta tell you, i don't like work chandler. okay? the guy's a suck-up.

CHANDLER:
 okay y'know what, because you said that, i'm not putting out tonight. 

MONICA:
 i'm telling you, something's wrong! my brother does not stay out all night.

JOEY:
 maybe we should check the trash chute.

RACHEL:
 ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.

JOEY:
 that's right, he almost could. which is exactly how i got stuck there. 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 there he is!

MONICA:
 oh my god!  where the hell have you been?!!

ROSS:
 just, y'know out.

RACHEL:
 ohh, out, oh god, i don't know why we didn't think to check there!

PHOEBE:
 what were you doing?

ROSS:
 i uh, went to a bar. and then i just uh, just walked around for a while.

RACHEL:
 you walked around all night in the city by yourself?

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 look, i don't have to answer your questions! okay? i'm a big boy, i can do whatever i want!

JOEY:
 he hooked up!! tell us about her!  

     commercial break 

 uh-oh-okay. uh-oh-okay. i know what you all are thinking. but chandler is in yemen! i'm a young woman! i have needs! i can't wait forever!

RACHEL:
 yeah! no that's what i was thinking.

 so i'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.

PHOEBE:
 oh, nobody's judging you. 

 oh! okay!   

ROSS:
 okay, look, i-i know what you guys are going to say

PHOEBE:
 you two will have very hairy children.

ROSS:
 okay, i didn't know you would say that.

RACHEL:
 ross! janice?!

JOEY:
 all right, hold on! hold on. hold on. this is ross, okay? he's our friend. he obviously went crazy. he obviously lost his mind.

ROSS:
 look, i didn't lose my mind! okay, janice and i have a lot in common! we've-we've both been divorced. we-we both have kids.

PHOEBE:
 so are you actually gonna see her again?

JOEY:
 phoebe! don't put ideas in his head!

ROSS:
 i am gonna see her again.

JOEY:

RACHEL:
  our entire friendship! but, when we were in high school i made out with james farrell even when i knew that you liked him! wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! okay, you go!

MONICA:
 my turn? what-what are you talking about?

RACHEL:
 ugh, monica, i know about you and chandler.

MONICA:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 i overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "i'll just tell rachel that i'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." and he said, "laundry? is that my new nickname?" and you said, "no! you know what your nickname is, mr. big."

MONICA:
 well. sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there rach. wow! let me know how that one turns out.

RACHEL:
 well, i wouldn't know because i got so freaked out that i hung up the phone.

MONICA:
 well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him mr. big

RACHEL:
 what?!

MONICA:
 mr. bigot. he tells the most racist jokes.

RACHEL:
 all right. so you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and chandler.

MONICA:
 me and chandler?!  

JOEY:
 all right, put your 20 bucks down. first one to find the tasty treat wins. okay?

PHOEBE:
 uh-hmm.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 y'know what? it sounds so weird to say this but, i just had a great day with janice!  

JOEY:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 are you serious?!

ROSS:
 yeah! i opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. i mean i talked for hours.  is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.

PHOEBE:
 you don't need janice for that, you've got us. we

JOEY:
 and the duck gets the nutter-butter!

PHOEBE:
  old wonton!

JOEY:
 judge rules, nutter-butter.

PHOEBE:
 ohh, tough call.

JOEY:
 yeah. 

 but seriously, i believe that we should all support president clinton. and her husband bill. 

 so how do you kids like your coffee?

MONICA:
 oh, none for me. thanks.

CHANDLER:
 just a little bit of sugar.

 well, maybe i'll bring it out and have monica stick her finger in it. that oughta sweeten it up, huh?  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh, you get used to it.

MONICA:
 y'know, i-i-i don't think that i can. so if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.

CHANDLER:
 so i laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?

MONICA:
 i'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when i can be hanging out with my boyfriend who i actually respect.

CHANDLER:
 oh. 

  if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.   did you hear what i said bing?

CHANDLER:
 what?

 the joke bing. what's the matter with you?

CHANDLER:
 well, i-i just didn't think it was funny sir.

 excuse me?

CHANDLER:
 well, i just

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 really?

MONICA:
 yeah! i mean it was really funny, i-i just don't think you got it. you see kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? but-but what doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. you get it now honey?

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 i thought you could use the help.

CHANDLER:
 coffee in a fight!  

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 oh well, chandler and monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
  jokes now?!

MONICA:
 sorry! i'm justi'm not very good at this! i'm a terrible liar and i hate having to lie to rachel!

CHANDLER:
 but we're not ready to tell yet!

MONICA:
 i know! it's just thatever since high school rachel was the one person i told everything too. y'know? i miss that so much now. she's my best friend.  

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 hey! hi!

MONICA:
 wh-wh-what are you doing here?  

RACHEL:
 well, i was actuallyi-i came over here to-to borrow this lamp. to umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.

MONICA:
 okay great! 

RACHEL:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 great! umm, well what-what i was doing in chandler's room is that umm, i was cleaning it! in fact, he pays me to clean it!

RACHEL:
 oh! what a great way to earn some extra pocket money.

MONICA:
 y'know when i said to you earlier that i was at work umm, i'm at my new work.

RACHEL:
 that's good enough. right?  books!

MONICA:
 okay.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

 here you go. 

ROSS:
 thanks!

ROSS:
 are you sure? because i can stay out as late as you want. i told you how i'm on sabbatical from work, right?

 yes! yes! you did!

ROSS:
 oh

 what is wrong now?!

ROSS:
 this isn't what i ordered! man! can anything go right in my life?! first my marriage falls apart and then

 i know! i know! and then you lose your apartment! and then you lose your job! and then your ex-wife gets married so fast! and now the coffeeahh!! ross, we need to talk.

ROSS:
 okay. sometimes i feel

 no-no-no, no. i'm going to talk. i believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.

ROSS:
 huh?

  think i can take another second of you whining!!

ROSS:
 let-let me make sure i'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because i'm too whiney?  i annoy you, janice.

 well yeah!!

ROSS:
 ohmygod!!

 are you gonna be okay?

ROSS:
 i am now.

 okay. 

JOEY:
 umm, hi.

 oh hi! well, i guess that's two out of three, joey.   ending credits  

ROSS:
 dude, we got to talk.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

ROSS:
 i just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and i hope this isn't too weird, but uh, i had uh, a thing with janice.   what you're-you're not mad?

CHANDLER:
 why would i be mad?

ROSS:
 well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. you don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.

CHANDLER:
  know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna forgive you! because that's what friends do! they forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. well, but i want you to remember that i forgave you.

ROSS:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 i also want you to remember that i let you live here rent free!

ROSS:
 all right.

MONICA:
 i can't believe we've never done this before! it's sooo good! so good for monica!  

CHANDLER:
 oh! look at that, time's up! my turn!

MONICA:
 that was a half an hour?

CHANDLER:
 it's your timer. 

MONICA:
 y'know, i don't like to brag about it, but i give the best massages!

CHANDLER:
 all right, then massage me up right nice!  

CHANDLER:
 ah! ahh!! ahh!!

MONICA:
 it's so good, isn't it?

CHANDLER:
 it's so good i don't know what i've done to deserve it!

MONICA:
 say good-bye to sore muscles!

CHANDLER:
 good-bye muscles!! opening credits 

CHANDLER:
 i'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. and i wanted to give it up i justi didn't know what it was!

JOEY:
 chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.

CHANDLER:
 look, for the first time in my life i'm in a real relationship. okay, i'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 whoa, dude, look out! you almost crushed my hat!  

ROSS:
 sorry.

CHANDLER:
  

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 oh! yeah, look there's this play all right? and i'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. a real clothes horse. so i figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

CHANDLER:
 and you're gonna make them all disappear.

JOEY:
 yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this. 

CHANDLER:
 done.

RACHEL:
 joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? i'll help you out.

JOEY:
 great! thanks, rach!

RACHEL:
 sure! 

JOEY:
 all right.  

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, how's it going?

CHANDLER:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey! umm, well, only okay because i just got back from, from the hospital. 

RACHEL:
 what?

ROSS:
 is everything okay?

JOEY:
 are you all right?

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, no-no-no. i'm fine. i'm okay, but umm, my grandma sorta died.

JOEY:
 pheebs! sorry!

PHOEBE:
 it's okay, i mean she had a really incredible life. and it's not like i'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.

RACHEL:
 well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!

MONICA:
  car right outside.

ROSS:
 uhh, pheebs' grandmother just died.

MONICA:
 ohh my god, i'm so sorry.

PHOEBE:
 it's okay. actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.

MONICA:
  she die?

PHOEBE:
 well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.

JOEY:
 pheebs, i'm so sorry.

PHOEBE:
 it was really sweet. the last thing she said to me was; "okay dear, you go get the eggs and i'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." and y'know what? we will meet at the checkout counter. 

RACHEL:
 okay now joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?

JOEY:
 all right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.

RACHEL:
 okay, it's missing something. ooh, i know! umm, okay.  

JOEY:
 really? a purse?

RACHEL:
 it's not a purse! it's a shoulder bag.

JOEY:
 it looks like a women's purse.

RACHEL:
 no joey, look. trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. look. 

JOEY:
 see look, women, carrying the bag.   but it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.

RACHEL:
 exactly! unisex!

JOEY:
 maybe you need sex. i had sex a couple days ago.

RACHEL:
 no! no joey! u-n-i-sex.

JOEY:
 well, i ain't gonna say no to that.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

 okay, i know that i went to that all ready.

PHOEBE:

 well, then who's been dead for five years?

PHOEBE:
 well, lots of people! look, are you coming to memorial service or not?

 umm, no. see i already thought she was dead so i kinda made my peace with it. plus, i'm going to a concert tomorrow. so i'd invite you, but umm, i only have two tickets left.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
  until tomorrow.

JOEY:
 yeah, but sandwich time is right now.  

RACHEL:
 joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 fine! do you take vasa or mustercard?  

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 all right relax, look i'll pay you with the money from the acting job i am definitely gonna get thanks to you.

ROSS:

JOEY:
 hey pheebs, i'm so sorry.

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

 oops, i'm sorry. excuse me. is this the umm, the memorial? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, welcome. 

 hello. hello.

PHOEBE:
 umm here's your 3-d glasses.

RACHEL:
 why?! why not?!

PHOEBE:
 come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! what do you think? he's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!

JOEY:
 what did you say to him?

PHOEBE:
 well, i said, i told him y'know, that i was the executor person of francis' will and that i needed to talk to him so i'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later. 

 could everyone please take their seats?

PHOEBE:
 all right, well, i just can't think about that right now. i just wanna say good-bye to my grandma.

RACHEL:
 okay.

MONICA:
 all right, let's go say good-bye.  

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 ahhh, i think you look great! that bag is gonna get you that part.

CHANDLER:
 and a date with a man!

JOEY:
 y'know what? make fun all you want. this is a great bag! okay? and it's as handy as it is becoming. now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. all right? so from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that joey, 

PHOEBE:
 all right, i'd better go too. i have to go talk to my dad.

RACHEL:
 ooh, pheebs, what are you gonna say? are you gonna tell him who you are?

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 well, but aren't you pissed at him?! i mean this guy abandoned you! i gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  me outside right now!" 

MONICA:
 well, at least you scared someone.

PHOEBE:
 y'know it's funny, you'd think i'd be angry. i mean, you'd think i'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. fortunately, i'm past it.

MONICA:
 phoebe, you do seem a little tense. here, let me help you. 

PHOEBE:
 all right.  

PHOEBE:
 oh! get off!! ow!! oh, stop it!! why?! why are you doing that to me?!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!

MONICA:
 you've been lying to me? i can't believe you'd do that.

ROSS:

MONICA:
 but the minute we start to lie to each other   and by 'we' i mean society. 

 any time you're ready, joey.

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 okay, but now see you're crying!

MONICA:
 i'm not crying about that! i'm crying about something that happened at work.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 it's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.

MONICA:
 oh my god! you don't know me at all!

CHANDLER:
 okay, you give the worst massages in the world.

MONICA:
 i'm crying here!!

CHANDLER:
 okay, hear me out. okay? you give the best bad massages. if anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "who's the best of that?" they'd have to go to you.

MONICA:
 huh. so you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?

CHANDLER:
 oh, it would be you! you! monica! and you'd get all the votes!

MONICA:
 so maybe they could umm, call the award the monica?

CHANDLER:
 absolutely!

MONICA:
 okay. i suck!

CHANDLER:
 yeah!  

PHOEBE:
 umm, thank you for meeting with me.

 thank you. all right.

PHOEBE:

 oh yes. yes, yes, i am, uh-hmm.

PHOEBE:
 okay.

 so, what did francis leave me?

PHOEBE:

 well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?

PHOEBE:
 oh yes. yes. yeahno. she did. she left you umm,   this lipstick.

 oh. huh. it's huh, well it's  cool.

PHOEBE:
 okay. i have just a few questions to ask so i'm going to get out my official forms.  and uh, you were married to francis' daughter lilly, is that correct?

 yes, yes i was.  umm, did that marriage end a. happily, b. medium, or c. in the total abandonment of her and her two children?

 it really says that?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah. see? 

 well then i guess then i-i would i would have to say c.

PHOEBE:
 hmm, okay, total abandonment. okay, reasons for abandonment, a. top secret government work, b. amnesia, or c. or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?

 y'know, i don't think i want the lipstick that much.   but umm oh, would you do me a favor? and umm, would you, would you give lilly that, please? 

PHOEBE:
 what?!

 well lilly, when you see lilly would you give her that, that note? because i wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well i pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and i well, i chickened out. so, uh, i wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?

PHOEBE:
 but you-you-you came to see lilly?

 yeah, yeah. why?

PHOEBE:
 lilly's dead. 

 she what?!

PHOEBE:
 she's dead.

 are you sure?

PHOEBE:
 well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.

 i can't believe this. i justi can't believe this. how-howoh my god. how long ago?

PHOEBE:
 17 years ago.

 oh! what about, what about the girls?

PHOEBE:
 well, ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in soho. and phoebe,  

PHOEBE:
 yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!

 phoebe, i-i-i-umm,   oops.  just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.

PHOEBE:
 yes. well, that's neither here nor there.

 so would it, would it make you feel better if i said i was very, very sorry that i left?

PHOEBE:
 y'know what, it doesnt matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.

 all right. well, y'know in my defense i was a lousy father.

PHOEBE:
 that's a defense?

 yes. yes it is. i burned the formula and i put your diapers on backwards. i mean, i made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!

PHOEBE:
 you make up songs?

 well no, just-just that one. but, it was stupid. let's see, how did it, how did it go. umm.   sleepy girl, sleepy girl. why won't you go to sleep? sleepy girl, sleepy girl. you're, you're, you're keeping me uppp!   yeah.   

 i just, i y'know, i'm not very good at this. so, umm  

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 not yet, no.  ending credits

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 i can't believe i'm hearing this!

RACHEL:
 wait a minute! wait a minute! i'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, i justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.

PHOEBE:
  putting stuff in boxes! 

RACHEL:
 i'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.

ROSS:
 ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.

RACHEL:
 ohh, i'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.

CHANDLER:
 and we're done with the chicken fried rice.

ROSS:
 hey! hey! if he's moving, maybe i should try to get his place!

 good idea! yes!

ROSS:
 it would be so cool to live across from you guys!

JOEY:
 hey, yeah! then we could do that telephone thing! y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 phoebe just found out about monica and chandler.

JOEY:
 you mean how they're friends and nothing more? 

RACHEL:
 no. joey, she knows! we were at ugly naked guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  the window.

PHOEBE:
 okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that rachel knows?

JOEY:
 yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!

PHOEBE:
 or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.

RACHEL:
 wh-what do you mean?

PHOEBE:
 well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.

RACHEL:
 ohhh, i-i would enjoy that!

JOEY:
 no-no-no! no-no wait rach, you know what would even be more fun? telling them.

RACHEL:
 ehhh, no, i wanna do phoebe's thing.

JOEY:
 i can't take any

PHOEBE:
 no! you don't have to do anything! just don't tell them that we know!

JOEY:
 noo! i can't take any more secrets!  i've got their secrets. i got secrets of my own y'know!

RACHEL:
 you don't have any secrets!

JOEY:
 oh yeah? well, you don't know about hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.  

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 ugh.

PHOEBE:
 well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.

RACHEL:
 okay.

PHOEBE:
 and then. i would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. my sexuality.

CHANDLER:
 

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie. 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey! ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
  have you been working out?

CHANDLER:
 well, i try to y'know, squeeze things.   are you okay?

PHOEBE:
 well, if you really wanna know, i'moh! i can't tell you this.

CHANDLER:
 phoebe, it's me. you can tell me anything.

PHOEBE:
 well actually you're the one person i can't tell this too. and the one person i want to the most.

CHANDLER:
 what's going on?

PHOEBE:
 i think it's just y'know that i haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just dont even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffeeoh no, have i said to much? well it's just something to think about. i know i will.    

MONICA:
 you are so cute! how did you get to be so cute?

CHANDLER:
 well, my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.

MONICA:
 okay, now you're even cuter!!

CHANDLER:
 y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say.

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, i think, i think phoebe was hitting on me.

MONICA:
 what are you talking about?

CHANDLER:
 i'm telling you i think phoebe thinks i'm foxy.

MONICA:
 that's not possible!

CHANDLER:
 ow!

MONICA:
 i'm sorry it's just, phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.

CHANDLER:
 oh, y'know i-i can't hear that enough.

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, i think that you just misunderstood her.

CHANDLER:
 no, i didn't misunderstand, okay? she was all over me! she touched my bicep for crying out loud!

MONICA:
 this bicep?

CHANDLER:
 well it's not flexed right now!  

RACHEL:
 hey mon, what are you doing now? wanna come see a movie with us?

MONICA:
 uhh, y'know actually i was gonna do some laundry.

RACHEL:
 oh.

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 i mean i-i don't i think i have enough quarters.

PHOEBE:
 i have quarters! 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hey ross! any word on the apartment yet?

ROSS:
 well, i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.

RACHEL:
 oh.

ROSS:
 no-no, i got the edge. i know it's not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to  tip the scales in my direction. check it out, you can probably see it from the window. 

MONICA:
 oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?

ROSS:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 that new mountain bike?

ROSS:
 no.

MONICA:
 well what did you send?

ROSS:
 a basket of mini-muffins.

PHOEBE:
 but there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. which one did you send?

ROSS:
 the small one.

RACHEL:
 what?! you-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?

ROSS:
 well yeah! someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. it was the best day.

CHANDLER:
 your work makes me sad.

ROSS:
 oh man! i want that place so much!! i was so sure that was gonna work! there's twelve bucks i'll never see again! 

RACHEL:
 all right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.

MONICA:
 bye!

 bye!

PHOEBE:
 bye chandler!  

CHANDLER:
  and the pinching!!

MONICA:
 actually, i did!

CHANDLER:
 okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?

MONICA:
 ohhh, oh my god! oh my god! she knows about us!

CHANDLER:
 are you serious?

MONICA:
 phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! that's the only explanation for it!

CHANDLER:
  bulging bicepsshe knows! commercial break  

CHANDLER:
  

JOEY:
 yeah?

CHANDLER:
 phoebe knows about us!

JOEY:
 well i didn't tell them!

MONICA:
 them?! who's them?

JOEY:
 uhhh, phoebe and joey.

MONICA:
 joey!

JOEY:
 and rachel. i would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!

CHANDLER:
 oh man!

JOEY:
 i'm sorry! but hey, it's over now, right? because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!

MONICA:
 unless

JOEY:
 no! not unless! look this must end now!

MONICA:
 oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! but see they don't know that we know that they know! so

CHANDLER:
 ahh yes, the messers become the messies!  

ROSS:
 noooo.

RACHEL:
 oh ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?

ROSS:
 look i've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!

RACHEL:
 y'know what you should do?

ROSS:
 huh?

RACHEL:
 you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. yeah! like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. or uh, or my underwear.

JOEY:
 i'm listening.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 that is a great idea! and! i know ugly naked guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.

PHOEBE:
 he broke that.

ROSS:
 well, he had gravity boots.

RACHEL:
 yeah, he broke those too.

JOEY:
 so he likes to break stuff.

ROSS:
 okay, i've got to go pick up ben but i-i will figure something out.   hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

PHOEBE:
 i wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.

JOEY:
 yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.

ROSS:
 right.  

RACHEL:
 hello!   it's chandler.

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 hello phoebe, i've been thinking about you all day.  

PHOEBE:
 eh?

CHANDLER:
 well you know that thing you said before, i'd be lying if i said i wasn't intrigued.

PHOEBE:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, listen, joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and i'll let you uh, feel my bicep. or maybe more.

PHOEBE:
 i'll have to get back to you on that. okay, bye!  he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!

RACHEL:
 are you kidding?!

PHOEBE:
 no!

RACHEL:
 i can not believe he would do that to monwhoa!   joey, do they know that we know?

JOEY:
 no.

RACHEL:
 joey!

JOEY:
 they know you know.

RACHEL:
 ugh, i knew it! oh i cannot believe those two!

PHOEBE:
 god, they thought they can mess with us! they're trying to mess with us?! they don't know that we know they know we know!  you can't say anything!

JOEY:
 i couldn't even if i wanted too.  

ROSS:
 good evening, sir. my name is ross geller. i'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. and i-i realize that the competition is fierce buti'm sorry. i, i can't help but notice you're naked and  man, i wish i was naked. i mean, this-this looks so great. that is how god intended it.  their respective strategies to break the other pairing. joey is not amused.

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 hmm. look, ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? the party's gonna cost you way more than that.

ROSS:

ROSS:
 oh, they'll like me. once they come to my awesome par-tay! okay, i gotta run. i gotta go get some nametags.

CHANDLER:
 very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of monica. i don't want you putting any ideas in her head.

RACHEL:
 umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head.

CHANDLER:
 wh-wh-why?!

RACHEL:
 well, because she loves you and because you love her.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!

RACHEL:
 hey, chandler, don't freak out! i'm telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies. and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's monica.

CHANDLER:
 i don't see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who's to say what she wants?! im right. i'm right. am i right?

RACHEL:
 no, you're right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different.

CHANDLER:
 okay. it's not different at all, is it?

RACHEL:
 not unless different means the same. 

 you were so funny with that waiter! you're such a nut!  

JOEY:
 

 no, you make them funny. you're the funny one!  

JOEY:
 uhh, look katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. okay? umm, look i like you. i-i really do, i like you a lot. okay? but sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.

 aww, like i could hurt you. are you making fun of my size? don't make fun of me because of my size!   

MONICA:
 isn't this great?

CHANDLER:
 hmm.

MONICA:
 couldn't you just stay like this forever?  chandler! couldn't you just stay here forever?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. 

MONICA:
 are you okay?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i'm cool. casual.

MONICA:
 what-what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 i'm just hanging out. y'know, having fun. y'know with the girl that i'm seeing casually.

MONICA:
 man, i knew it! i knew you were going to do this!!

CHANDLER:
 what?!

MONICA:
 get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.

CHANDLER:
 well, you do want all that stuff, right?

MONICA:
 oh and you know what i want!

CHANDLER:
 yes! you want babies! you have baby fever!

MONICA:
 i do not have baby fever!

CHANDLER:
 oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! i've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!

MONICA:
 have you lost your mind? chandler, this isn't about me! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!

CHANDLER:
 nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!

MONICA:
 you don't know everything. did you know that i'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm? and did you know that the only baby around here is you?! and did you know that i can't even look at you right now?! 

CHANDLER:
 well, i did not know that. commercial break 

CHANDLER:
 it's gonna be okay, right? i mean she's not gonna leave me? this is, this is fixable. 

 oh yeah, yeah, sure. absolutely.

CHANDLER:
 by me?

ROSS:
 oh, no!

JOEY:
 no-no.

ROSS:
 well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.

JOEY:
 yeah, big! 

JOEY:
 uh-oh, shht! the misses.

MONICA:
 gunther, can i get a coffee 

CHANDLER:
 monica. 

MONICA:
 i'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.

CHANDLER:
 just tell me what i need to do to make things right.

MONICA:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 well, that's what we do. y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think i'm all cute again.

MONICA:
 really? i'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. you're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. all right? y'know what? if you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.     and puts on a nametag that says ross, but doesn't quite like it. so he takes it off and puts on one that says dr. geller and he puts the ross one underneath the dr. geller one. then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for howard raging in the apartment  

   howard! howard! howard!  howard! howard! howard! howard!  howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! yay!!

ROSS:
 phoebe! 

PHOEBE:
 oh, hi ross!

ROSS:
 what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for howard. he's just the sweetest little man! 

 see ya phoebe! oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!

ROSS:
 you chipped in?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.

ROSS:
 phoebe! i can't believe you gave them money! i thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but they didn't ask me! y'know? this way i'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. that's always fun to be.

ROSS:
 yeah, but you're making me look bad!

PHOEBE:
 no i'm not. no! if anything i'm making you look better! they'll see you talking to me and that's--i'm a hit!

 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

 oh hey, ross. umm, see, i was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because phoebe's more our kind of people. something to think about.   

PHOEBE:
 yeah, okay, my bad.  little puffy, but that's probably from the large number of different color sweaters he's 

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi! wow! you look, you lookbig.

JOEY:
 thanks! i've been working out. hey listen, is it obvious that i'm wearing six sweaters?

RACHEL:
 uhhh, yeah. but it's not obvious why.

JOEY:
 well look, im breaking up with katie so i had to put on some extra padding. y'know? i mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when i tell her i'm taking away the joey love?

 

JOEY:
 hey! hiya!

RACHEL:
 hey! hey, cute jacket!

 oh, thanks! that's so sweet! 

RACHEL:
 oh! ow! 

 oh, ow! did joey tell you to say that? you guys,  much! 

RACHEL:
 whoa!  the one who is too much. 

 ohh, joey has the nicest friends! 

RACHEL:
 ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! 

 you're so sweet! 

RACHEL:
 ohh, you're so sweet! 

 oww!!!! joey, she just kicked me.

JOEY:
 huh.

 well? aren't you gonna do something?

JOEY:
 uhh.

 you'd better do something, or i'm gonna walk out that door right now! well? are you gonna?

JOEY:
 nah.   

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
  

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 ooh. 

ROSS:
 look, this is a disaster! can't i please just go?

PHOEBE:
 no! no! i'm talking you up to people. just give it a little time, all right? relax, get something to eat! okay? 

ROSS:
 so uh, what did you tell them about me?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i was telling them about you and emily. y'know, try to get some sympathy.

ROSS:
 ohh. 

PHOEBE:
 but somehow you came off as the bad guy.

ROSS:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i think i told it wrong. y'know, we should talk about that because i don't totally understand what happened there.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay, see? things are looking up already!

   who would do a think like that?  

 3-b!

 oh yeah, aww!

 okay, you got your free food! you ruined everyone's fun! don't you think it's time you went home?!

 yeah, leave!

 yeah, get out! now!

 go back to 3-b, 3-b!

PHOEBE:
 all right, everyone calm down! everyone calm down! i have something that i would like to say! who here likes ross?   of course you don't like him! he-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when i asked, "who hear likes ross," and he's wearing two nametags!  guys, when i first met ross i didn't like him at all! but then once i got to know him i saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. i mean, all i'm saying is don't judge ross before you get to know him all right? i mean, i like all you guys now, but when i first meet you y'know kurt, i thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm lola, mind numbingly stupid! and okay, you guys    so, i think you all know what i mean. 

PHOEBE:
 obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.

ROSS:
 oh wow, yeah! see, i did not get that.  

CHANDLER:
 where's monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it's urgent! is she here?

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 i need to talk to you, it's urgent!

MONICA:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there's only one-one way to do this.  

MONICA:
 wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 no-no, don't-don't-don't do it!

CHANDLER:
 will you marry me?  

ROSS:
 oh-no. no. no.

JOEY:
 what a bad idea!

RACHEL:
 ohhhh, i cannot look at it! 

MONICA:
 chandler, why are you doing this?

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. but i know i'm not afraid to do this.

MONICA:
 chandler.

CHANDLER:
 i'm doing this because i'm sorry?

MONICA:
 do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?

CHANDLER:
 no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  will you be my wife?

MONICA:
  want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.

MONICA:
 honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now!

CHANDLER:
 yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys. 

MONICA:
 who? two divorces and joey?!

ROSS:
 hey!

JOEY:
 she's right y'know.

ROSS:
 yeah, but still, cheap shot!

MONICA:
 y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you're not ready for that.

CHANDLER:
 i didn't think i was! 

MONICA:
 oh my god, what would have done if i said yes?

CHANDLER:
 well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door.  ending credits 

JOEY:
 hey ross, will you pass me that knife?

ROSS:
 no, i will not!

JOEY:
 oh, it's okay. you don't have to be so mean about it.

ROSS:
 you're right, i'm sorry. will you marry me? 

PHOEBE:
 aw, and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week.

RACHEL:
 oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler?

CHANDLER:
 okay, how long is this going to go on.

MONICA:
 well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.

ROSS:
 this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole "we were on a break thing?" well, i'm sorry, will you marry me?  

CHANDLER:
 that's not funny.

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

JOEY:
 what are you guys doing up?

CHANDLER:
 oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i think that's wrong, but there's a connect the dots in here for you later. 

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 aww, you guys are so cute!

MONICA:
 i know.

JOEY:
 all right, i'll see you in the morning. 

 okay.   

 y'know, i love doing crossword puzzles with you honey! 

 aww, me too. now let's finish this and go to bed. 

 okay! there's only one left, three letter word, not dog but 

 cat. 

 yes! you are so smart!  

 i love you too.    opening credits  

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 all right. hold on.  

RACHEL:
 a couple of bucks.

PHOEBE:
 okay, dime!  could take a while.  my god, this is a police badge!

MONICA:
 wow!

CHANDLER:
 oh that's so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they don't serve donuts.  think i can come up with something better than that.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, i bet somebody's missing that badge.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i should probably take it back. ooh, but you know what? while i'm at the police station, i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!  

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey joey!

MONICA:
 hey.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 oh yes, it is. i'm sorry i borrowed it, i was cold. i hope its okay?

JOEY:
 well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and im not him.

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, i'll give it back to you.

JOEY:
 no-no! no! i mean it's gonna be all smelling like monica!

MONICA:
 are you saying i smell bad?

JOEY:
 no! no, you smell like a meadow.  

MONICA:
 what's with him?

CHANDLER:
 oh, y'know what? the last time joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.  dragged rachel along for the trip, and she's not too happy about it. ross is sitting on it in different ways to see how it feels. he tries to just sit on it normally, and then he tries flopping on it. one thing about this couch, it's huge. it's like twice the size of a 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
   i'm sorry i just wanna make sure that i bought the right couch. i need a couch that says, "kids welcome here." but that also says,  here to me!"

RACHEL:
 what?! you say that to kids?!!

ROSS:
 no! no! no! the "come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.

RACHEL:
 ross, honey, it's a nice couch. it's not a magic couch.

 you picked a great couch.

ROSS:
 yeah?

 yeah. could you just sign right here please?  

ROSS:
 oh, sure. whoa-whoa, what's this? the delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!

RACHEL:
 wait! no, that's ridiculous. come on, he lives three blocks away!

ROSS:
 yeah, y'know what? i'll take it myself, thank you!   all right rach, let's go!  

RACHEL:
 yeah!   

ROSS:
 oh, come on it's only three blocks! and-and, it's not very heavy, try it! come on! come on!

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

 ohh, okay.  stops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes rachel up against a 

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ross!

 well you, her, i mean, she's veryy'know. and you're likey'know.

ROSS:
 not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.

 really? you two?

ROSS:
 yeah! rach?

RACHEL:
 come on, i don't really want to be doing this right now. i am carrying a very heavy couch.

ROSS:
 then tell him quickly.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!

RACHEL:
 ross!! oh my--ugh!! you kept count?! you are such a loser!

ROSS:
 a loser you did it with    

PHOEBE:
 oh. oh! ma'am? excuse me, ma'am? 

 yes?

PHOEBE:
 you can't put your cigarette out on a tree!

 yeah i can, it worked real well.

PHOEBE:
 no but you shouldn't! don't ever do that again.

 i won't! 

PHOEBE:
 hold it! 

 what?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah that's right you are so busted.  'em.

 who are you talking too?

PHOEBE:
 save it red! unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.

 i am not going to apologize to a tree!

PHOEBE:
 you apologize to the tree right now or i am calling for backup.   

 i-i'm sorry! sorry.

PHOEBE:
 okay, cancel backup! cancel backup!  

ROSS:
 okay. 

RACHEL:
 ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?

ROSS:
 uhh, yes i did but there isn't. okay, here we go.  staircase has three steps then a landing, makes a 90-degree turn, and has more steps 

ROSS:
 okay, go left. left! left!  

RACHEL:
 okay, y'know what? there is no more left, left!

ROSS:
 oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! straight up over your head! you can do it! you can do it!  you got it?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 good-good-good. 

RACHEL:
 oh-oh!   

ROSS:
 yeah, you got it right? you got it right? you got it?   

RACHEL:
 any chance you think the couch looks good there?  

PHOEBE:
 so this guy was all  

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 i know but i'm having so much fun doing good deeds.

CHANDLER:
 okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you could get arrested.

PHOEBE:
 you could get arrested, right now!   all right, yeah, i gotta take it back. i'm totally drunk with power.  

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 hi, joe.

JOEY:
 yeah, i didnt know you guys were going to be here.

MONICA:
 hey joey, sweetie, taste this. 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 what is going on with you?

JOEY:
 nothing!

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on! you've been acting strange all day!

JOEY:
 all right! there is something. i kinda had a dream,  want to talk about it. 

CHANDLER:
 whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that?  dont want to talk about it.

JOEY:
 well, it involved monica.

CHANDLER:
 you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing?! oh, that is so cool!   love you. 

JOEY:
 don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. i haven't dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two--ish. 

MONICA:
 what was the dream about?

JOEY:
 well, okay. you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. y'know like you guys were doing last night. so, that's it. i'm in love with monica and i'll be moving out.

MONICA:
 wait, joey! joey! that doesnt mean that-that you're in love with me!

JOEY:
 it-it doesnt?

MONICA:
 no!

CHANDLER:
 no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud.

JOEY:
 that kinda sounds like your dream dude.

MONICA:
 or, it could mean that-that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.

JOEY:
 in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.

MONICA:
 um-hmm.

CHANDLER:
 joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her?

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 well there you have it!

MONICA:
 well sure! i'm just wearing sweats!   but that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!

JOEY:
 no, i don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. y'know? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?

CHANDLER:
 well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe-maybe that's it?

JOEY:
 friends first? that's interesting.

MONICA:
 you become friends after?

JOEY:
 no, never done that either.

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom. 

MONICA:
   

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
   commercial break  half on the curb and right in front of the door, making it difficult for people to enter 

PHOEBE:
 excuse me, is this your car?

 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 well i don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. 

 don't worry about it. it's not a problem.

PHOEBE:
 well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause i'm a cop. 

 

PHOEBE:
 ohh, no.  anywhere, 'cause i know that 'cause i'm a cop too. so, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. 

 

PHOEBE:
 i-i'm with the umm, the 57th.

 oh, i know a guy in homicide up there.

PHOEBE:
 i'm in vice. yeah, in fact i'm undercover right now. i'm a whore.

 who-who else is in vice up there?

PHOEBE:
 umm, do you know, umm sipowicz?

 sipowicz? no, i don't think so.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, big guy, kinda bald.

 no, i don't know him.

PHOEBE:
  'cause he's not there, he's out. his umm, his partner just died.

 wow umm, tell sipowicz i'm real sorry for his loss.

PHOEBE:
 i-i sure will, take care. 

  heard that kid from silver spoons is really good.  you find my badge?

PHOEBE:
 oh.    

RACHEL:
 hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch?

JOEY:
 oh, i'd love too, but i got acting class. but y'know what? i guess i can blow that off,  

RACHEL:
 thanks!

JOEY:
 uh, hey, rach let me ask you something. uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight.

RACHEL:
 i know.

JOEY:
 yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. i'm thinking of getting me one of those.

RACHEL:
 what's up joe?

JOEY:
 well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great

RACHEL:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 is because they were friends first. y'know? so i asked myself, "who are my friends?" you and phoebe, and i saw you first. so

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch.

RACHEL:
 y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i-i don't think we should be cranking anything up.

JOEY:
 i'll treat you real nice. 

RACHEL:
  honey, listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. don't hit on your existing friends!

JOEY:
 won't-won't that take longer?

RACHEL:
 yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.

JOEY:
 yeah. i understand. i understand.  first!  

ROSS:
 come here to me. no-no, you come here to me.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 oh great! what, you brought joey?

RACHEL:
 well, i brought the next best thing.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica!

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so

ROSS:
 look, i-i drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  rach, 

RACHEL:
 whoa-oh, what's-what's that? 

ROSS:
 oh, that's me.

RACHEL:
 wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself.

ROSS:
 no! that's-that's my arm!

CHANDLER:
  liked your new couch.

ROSS:
 y'know what? just-just follow my lead.  

RACHEL:
 okay!

CHANDLER:
 okay.

ROSS:
 come on, chandler.   

ROSS:
 all right.   

ROSS:
 all right, ready?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 turn.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 turn! turn! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, i don't think we can turn anymore!

RACHEL:
 ross, i don't, i just don't think it's going to fit.

ROSS:
 oh yeah it will! come on, up! up-up-up! up! yes! here we go! pivot!   pivot! piv-ot! piv-et!! piv-ett!!! piv-et!

CHANDLER:
 shut up! shut up! shut up!! 

ROSS:
 okay, i don't think it's going to pivot anymore. 

 you think?!

ROSS:
 all right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.  

CHANDLER:
 okay, yeah, i think it's really stuck now.

ROSS:
 i can't believe that didn't work!

RACHEL:
 i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch!

CHANDLER:
 oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?  

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 hey! how's it going? did you make any new friends?

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah, i met this woman. 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed.

MONICA:
 joey, i thought you were gonna try to be friends first!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 what?! why?!

JOEY:
 well because you didn't give me advice! no! you gave me a pickup line! as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  roommate!

MONICA:
 what about the closeness?

JOEY:
 closeness-shmoshness! there was three of us for crying out loud!  

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 ooh, i do! i do! i do!

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 well, if i'm going down, i'm taking you   chandler.  you'll never make it stick and you know it!

 yeah, but i kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. i mean, you understand right?

PHOEBE:
 yep! as long as you understand that i'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. a fool!

 i don't like looking foolish. y'know what? maybe uh, i don't arrest you today. maybe i came by and you weren't here.

PHOEBE:
 i would love it if i weren't here!

 okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight i was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?

PHOEBE:
 me?!

 yeah. ever since you flashed my badge at me, i kinda can't stop thinking about you. you're the prettiest, fake undercover whore i've ever seen. 

 nice!

PHOEBE:
 wow! i didn't see that coming! you're-you're asking me out!

 yeah. i mean, i coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.

PHOEBE:
 umm, yeah, i'd like to go out with you officer

 gary.

PHOEBE:
 gary.

 okay, so it's a date.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! so--ooh, i gotta ask you though. how did you know where to find me?

 well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so i just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so i just checked it out.

PHOEBE:
 ohh, impressive.

 not as impressive as you. i gotta tell you, i looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, we'll talk at dinner.

 okay.  up?

PHOEBE:
 all right, i can't wait!

 okay. and don't worry, i'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.

ROSS:
 this couch, is cut in half! i would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!

ROSS:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 i got this pair marked excess, i gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.

RACHEL:
 anyway, i'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, i'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!

PHOEBE:
 wow! well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!

RACHEL:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 you wanna work on your interview skills?

RACHEL:
 o-okay!

PHOEBE:
 okay! all right, let's start with the handshake. hi.

RACHEL:
 hi.  

PHOEBE:
 very good handshake, good wrist action.

MONICA:
 let me try. 

PHOEBE:
 okay.  i ever do to you?! 

MONICA:
 did i squeeze it too hard?

PHOEBE:
 let's just say, i'm glad i'm not chandler.  opening credits 

JOEY:
 that's right ross, i can see you in your new apartment! and you can see me! same as yesterday, 

MONICA:
 is he doing his shark attack bit yet?

JOEY:
 nope. op, wait! there he goes.   shark, picture one of the many, many, many jaws movies they made and you get the 

JOEY:
   oh no-no-no, i wasn't waving at you lady.   ross's building is flirting with me.

MONICA:
 get in there man! flirt back, mix it up!

JOEY:
 yeah, i-i-i'm down with that.  goes.  a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. she   okay, i-i-i'll be right over. let's see, she's on the third floor

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 tell me about it, huh?  i'm not with her, she's just monica!    walking up the hallway counting doors. he comes to what he thinks is the right one and 

ROSS:
 hey joey! great stuff huh?

JOEY:
 this is your place?

ROSS:
 of course it is. yeah, come on in. ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. 

JOEY:
 but i counted, you're not supposed to live here! oh man!  

JOEY:
 ugh!!

MONICA:
 what happened?

JOEY:
 i ended up at ross's place. oh, i musta missed counted or something.  'watching tv' bit.  

MONICA:
 no joey, i think he's just watchin' tv.    

 we've lost visual contact with the suspect.

 okay, now i've really have to go!

PHOEBE:
 but it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.

 i know, but it's my job, sweethart!

PHOEBE:
 okay, then maybe i can come too!

 suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.

PHOEBE:
 all right, you go. 

 bye-bye.

PHOEBE:
 'kay, bye! 

PHOEBE:
 oh god!

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh i just miss him so much!

MONICA:
 wow! for just a week you guys are really close, huh?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, it's weird. i can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? but like a really tough one that shots bad guys. ohh, i just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! you just like can't keep your hands off each other.

MONICA:
 i know it is the best.

PHOEBE:
 so-so how long did that last for you and chandler?

MONICA:
 what? it's still going on.

PHOEBE:
 come on, seriously! when did it end?

MONICA:
 i-i am serious, i mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.

PHOEBE:
 okay, you know where you are better than i do. i was just curious.

MONICA:
  just calm down phoebe! all right?! why dont you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!

PHOEBE:
  obviously, i justi misspoke. it's okay.

MONICA:
 oh no, it is okay, i mean as long as you know that chandler and i are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! i mean our flame, whew, is on fire!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 you are so cute.   

CHANDLER:
 oh hey, how'd the interview go?

RACHEL:
 ugh, horrible! i did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!

JOEY:
 did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?

RACHEL:
 no!

CHANDLER:
 so what happened?

RACHEL:
 ugh, it was horrible! and-and the interview part went so well, y'know? i even made him laugh. he said something about a boat and i was like, "well, yeah! if you've got enough life jackets!"   trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!

JOEY:
 what happened?

RACHEL:
  were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but i totally miss read him and i uhhh  

JOEY:
 you kissed him?!

RACHEL:
 well, i didn't know what else to do!

CHANDLER:
 well you coulda tried, not kissing him.

RACHEL:
 thanks chandler.

MONICA:
  called, you got a second interview!

RACHEL:
 i can't believe it! i got a second interview!

MONICA:
 yes!

JOEY:
 i bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?

RACHEL:
 what-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?

JOEY:
 yeah! 

MONICA:
 a kiss? what are you talking about?

RACHEL:
 i accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"

CHANDLER:
 come on, rach.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! what if he thinks i'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?

MONICA:
 he probably wants you back because you're right for the job.

RACHEL:
 maybe. i-i don't knowoh god, how could i be so stupid?!

JOEY:
 oh rachel look, don't say that, i think you just need a hug from joey. come on. come on.  back!

RACHEL:
 ohh, well i'm not totally back yet, but thank you.

JOEY:
 no, in ross's building!   she's back! she's back!  

CHANDLER:
 i gotta check out this hot girl!   there she is!    

JOEY:
 damnit!! did you move?!

ROSS:
 yes. i lived with you guys for a while and then i found this place.   i'm ross.  

 yes?

JOEY:
 

 no. i'm all alone.

JOEY:
 yeah. sorry about that.   oh, hey little girl. uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?

JOEY:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 thank you.

  uhh 

RACHEL:
 what?

 just ah 

RACHEL:
 excuse me?

 here let me 

RACHEL:
  on here! now listen, look-look, i'm sorry if i gave you the wrong impression, but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! now even though i  , hey-hey-hey, even though i kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. i do not want, this job that bad. good day, sir.  

RACHEL:
  lauren did too me!  

RACHEL:
 okay-okay that-that's amazing. how did you know that?

ROSS:
 you got ink on your lip.

RACHEL:
 oh.  

CHANDLER:
 

 i don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.

CHANDLER:
 oh, what can happen? i mean, would you  

 yeah, i'm gonna say no.

MONICA:
 phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?

PHOEBE:
 oh we can't, we already have plans.

MONICA:
 what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 well, same thing we did all day, hang out at gary's apartment. he is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. but have fun at the movie.

MONICA:
   oh, we're not seeing a movie!

PHOEBE:
 you're not? then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?

MONICA:
 oh umm, that's because i just wanted to y'know walk in on me and chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. will you excuse me for just a second?

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 okay.  for a second?

CHANDLER:
 uh, yeah.

MONICA:
 okay.  them! {here we go yet again.}

CHANDLER:
 why?

MONICA:
 'cause, gary and phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!

CHANDLER:
 ohh, so?

MONICA:
 so! so we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!

CHANDLER:
 monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! okay? it's crazy. {finally! the voice of reason.} i mean, just impress gary and phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and i'm saying no to this, why? get your coat. commercial break  reads, "are you the hot girl who waved at me? if so, give me a call!" and it's signed, joey 629-9***  

ROSS:
  

   you should check this out, tell the other tenants. apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.

ROSS:
   

ROSS:
 i don't, i don't think we've meet. i-i'm ross.

 i know. you're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.

ROSS:
 nevermind! 

 no, i-i actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. i mean you had just moved in.

ROSS:
 i had just moved in. thank you! listen umm

 jen.

ROSS:
 jen, i know this may sound a little but uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or

 sure! that would be nice.

ROSS:
 umm?

 oh! my number is on there. 

ROSS:
 i will give you a call.

 i'll see you later. 

ROSS:
 okay!  

 i forgot my paper.   

CHANDLER:
 that was amazing!

MONICA:
 phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.

CHANDLER:
 that was amazing.

MONICA:
 we are the hottest! huh? no one is hotter than we are! you're the best.

CHANDLER:
 no, you're the best.

MONICA:
 no, you're the best.

CHANDLER:
 no, you're the best.

MONICA:
 i am the best. 

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
  the other day?

JOEY:
 i don't know. but i can see through your sheet.  yeah, yeah, that's her. but y'know what? doesn't matter, i'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.

MONICA:
 why?

JOEY:
 because it's impossible to find her apartment! she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.

MONICA:
 what are you talking about?  lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!

JOEY:
 no. no. no. she lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.

MONICA:
 no, those first two windows,  other one over there, that's the stairway. you've been counting wrong.

JOEY:
 i did not know that! thank you monica.  believe i almost lost another girl because of counting. 

ROSS:
 so uhh, you ready?

 sure, i'll just get my coat.  that?

ROSS:
 sure.  joey

JOEY:
 dahhhhh!!   

RACHEL:
 ah, first, i-i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.

 that's quite all right, but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.

RACHEL:
  start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.

 fair enough.

RACHEL:
 now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. rachel then doesn't know where to put  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and i think that's a big mistake and here's why. i made a huge fool of myself and i came back, that shows courage. when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, i said no. that shows integrity. and, i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.   okay umm, now i know i already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. and umm, and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, i said no and i was not litigious. {by the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  so she didn't want to sue him.   don't worry, i had to look it up too.} so there you go, you got, you got   courage, you got integrity, you got  not litigious. look mr

 zelner.

RACHEL:
 zelner! right! i knew that! i really, really want this job and i think, i think i would be really good at it.

 y'know what? i may regret this but uh, i'm going to give you a shot.

RACHEL:
 

 um-hmm.

RACHEL:
 really? oh thank you! oh oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?

 yes!

RACHEL:
 okay, well then how about a handshake?   oh god i'm sorry! oh god, i'm sorry! i did not mean to touch thati mean you there. there. uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, i'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you sohey! i'll see you monday!   

PHOEBE:
 you tired chandler?

MONICA:
 you better believe he's tired, after the day we had! if you know what i mean. you know what i mean?

CHANDLER:
 honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.

 so uh chandler, you like that badge i got you?

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, it's so cool.   now i gotta go, officer bing has gotta, 10-100.  

MONICA:
 phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.

PHOEBE:
 ohh, 

 yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so

MONICA:
 you didn't!

PHOEBE:
 we did! we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code!

MONICA:
 the park huh? a public place.

 uh-huh.

MONICA:
 i hear ya. excuse me for just a second!   

MONICA:
 hi chandler.

CHANDLER:
 monica! this is the men's room! 

MONICA:
 yes it is. you see i've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. haven't you?

CHANDLER:
 no. and if i did, i don't think we'd be going out. monica, this is getting ridiculous!

MONICA:
 come on, we can't let them win!

CHANDLER:
 ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!

MONICA:
 because phoebe and gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 i feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.

CHANDLER:
 oh wow! is that what this all have been about?

MONICA:
 wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?

CHANDLER:
 yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, i'm more excited about where we are right now.

MONICA:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 yeah! i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that's pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that's pretty exciting. 

MONICA:
 that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way.

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship.

MONICA:
 did not.

CHANDLER:
 yes you did! admit it! you freaked out!

MONICA:
 okay, i freaked out a little.

CHANDLER:
 little?! you freaked out big time! okay? and i fixed it! we have switched places! i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!  ending credits    

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 thank god! i can't watch him anymore!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah! oh by the way, thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine.   pictures of their faces pasted onto cardboard cutouts of pamela anderson and yasmine 

JOEY:
 okay, pick a card.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

JOEY:
 all right now, memorize it. 

CHANDLER:
 oh yes.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
    

 

ROSS:
 hi!

CHANDLER:
 hi there!

 hi!!

 guess what? ben is going to be in a tv commercial!

PHOEBE:
 what are you talking about?!

ROSS:
  park who thought ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.

JOEY:
  director in town!   ben!  times and no one offered me an audition.

ROSS:
 i know, it's crazy! we were just pushing ben on the swings

JOEY:
 i'm always on the swings! what am i doing wrong?!

CHANDLER:
 that.  opening credits   

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 luck!

CHANDLER:
 hey rach, now that you're working at ralph lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?

RACHEL:
 uh well, y'know what? i don't think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day

CHANDLER:
 unwilling to steal from work, interesting.

MONICA:
 besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.

RACHEL:
 okay guys, way to wish me luck!

 good luck! go get 'em! 

PHOEBE:
 okay, let's discuss rachel's birthday. i say we throw a surprise party this weekend.

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.

PHOEBE:
 yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.

MONICA:
 i think it's a great idea. yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.

JOEY:
 ross!! we're having a surprise party for rachel!!

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 done.

PHOEBE:
 okay, great so do you want to do it together?

MONICA:
 i would love to do it together! 

JOEY:
 they're gonna do it together.

CHANDLER:
 dude! that's my girlfriend!

JOEY:
 what, so i gotta shut it down now?

ROSS:
 all right, i gotta take off. i'm picking up ben then we're off to the big audition.

MONICA:
 it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad.

ROSS:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 weirder than watching his two moms make out?  

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa dad? there's a dad in the commercial?

ROSS:
 yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.

JOEY:
 whoa, hey, maybe i'll go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad. i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather.

ROSS:
 you're not his godfather.

JOEY:
 what?! are you kidding?!

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 all right!   

JOEY:
 hey! i'm in, they're gonna let me audition!

ROSS:
 really? that's great!

JOEY:
 i know! i know! it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so i steered clear of her

  that kid looks familiar.

JOEY:
 oh yeah, yeah! he's done tons of commercials. i've seen him in like sugar smacks, playstation, and that one for the phone company. in fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. chandler was mad.

ROSS:
 yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. ben is way cuter than that kid. i mean look at him, look at you, 

JOEY:
 that's great. listen, wouldn't it be great though if i got to play ben's dad?

ROSS:
 joey, you look nothing like ben.

JOEY:
 i look more like him than you do! 

 y'know, i don't really know you well enough for you to do that.  assistant  

 so it's down to these two, nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree. rachel, what do you think?

RACHEL:
 well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric   sorry.

 oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them--i'm kidding.

 she is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. okay, now i'm kidding!

RACHEL:
 

 i don't know which one, but i do know i need a cigarette. so what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back? 

 

RACHEL:
 oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories totally supported the princess's right to smoke. 

RACHEL:
 and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!

MONICA:
 that doesn't seem fair.

RACHEL:
 i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, it is the best.

RACHEL:
 i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? me or smokey smokerson?

MONICA:
 rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. just say you wanna get some fresh air.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i can do that.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey rach, you wanna get some coffee?

RACHEL:
 i would love to!

PHOEBE:
 oh good!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i wanna go to babe.

PHOEBE:
 oh good. 

PHOEBE:
 oh wait, i change my mind!  talk about the party! i have so many ideas! 

MONICA:
 yeah, me too! 

PHOEBE:
 oh, look at that.

MONICA:
 all right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what i thought we would start out with tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my cds! i've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.

PHOEBE:
 what happened to the intimate dinner party?

MONICA:
 oh, we're not doing that. okay

PHOEBE:
 so wow, it looks like you took care of everything. thanks a lot, co-host.

MONICA:
 what?! i didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!

PHOEBE:
 like what?

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 cups? you're giving me cups?

MONICA:
 and ice!

PHOEBE:
 cups and ice? ooh, i get to be in charge of cups and ice?   all right. fine, okay, i will be in charge of cups and ice!

MONICA:
 wait a minute, i can get ice at the restaurant

PHOEBE:
 i got it! mine!

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 hey! how'd the audition go?!

ROSS:
 not so good.

MONICA:
 wait a minute, are you doing joey's  well. 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
  didn't get a callback.

MONICA:
 you got a callback too didn't you?

JOEY:
  

 hey rachel, what are you doing out here?

RACHEL:
 oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air.

 nancy and i were talking about the fall collection.

RACHEL:
 oh great!

 so anyway we really  honey, we're just smoking all over you.

 oh, sorry!

RACHEL:
 oh that's okay.

 no-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. 

 so anyway i sent the designs over to ralph and he's very excited about the line.

 oh that's great! you are the best! 

RACHEL:
 excuse me, can i, can i bum one of those?  what, actually   okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?

 i thought you didn't smoke.

RACHEL:
 oh, i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? y'know what i mean, like dubbies? and i actually, i thought to myself, "wow, those guys are crazy!" but no, i actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.

 we get high.

RACHEL:
 oh, me too.

 i'm kidding.

RACHEL:
  

ROSS:
 oh god, this is so nerve wracking! how-how do you do this?

JOEY:
 well, unfortunately, i don't get many callbacks so

 is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?

JOEY:
 who knows?

  ben, kyle, and joey. the rest of you, thank you very much.

ROSS:
 yes!! i knew it!!  later!

JOEY:
 oh this is great! i might actually get to play ben's dad!

ROSS:
 yeah!

 actually, that can't happen. yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with raymond and kyle with ben. so it'll be either you two 

JOEY:
 man, this is gonna be kinda weird.

ROSS:
 yeah, it is.

 yeah. it's gonna be weird.

ROSS:
 no, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.

 oh, oh, i thought we were just talking. commercial break 

PHOEBE:
  

 hi!

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 ah sure. what's in 'em?

PHOEBE:
 umm, cups.

CHANDLER:
 oh good, because uh we got rachel 800 gallons of water.

ROSS:
 seriously that's a lot of cups.

PHOEBE:
 yeah well, that's 'cause monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.

CHANDLER:
 y'know i rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.

PHOEBE:
 okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.   oh, hi joey!

JOEY:
 hey pheebs! 

ROSS:
 hey!

JOEY:
 ross good, i'm uh glad you're here. i wanna talk to you about something.

ROSS:
 what's up?

JOEY:
 well, i've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. so, i think i'm just gonna step aside. i'm gonna tell them that i won't audition.

ROSS:
 wow, uh, joey that's-that's great. thanks man.

JOEY:
 that's it? you're-you're gonna let me do this?! this-this is my career we're talking about here!

ROSS:
 well, you just

JOEY:
 i just said that so you wouldn't let ben do it! look ross, if anyone should step aside it should be ben!

ROSS:
 what?!

JOEY:
 what? chandler! tell 'em!

CHANDLER:
   oh, hi! no one. 

ROSS:
 why should ben step aside? it was his audition in the first place! you-you just tagged along! you're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.

JOEY:
 at least i care about his feelings!

ROSS:
 what?!

JOEY:
 do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it?

ROSS:
 and why wouldn't he get it?

JOEY:
 oh, come on! have you seen what my kid can do?! huh?! i mean he dials phones! he-he-he eats tortilla chips! he-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!

ROSS:
 are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?

JOEY:
 you just give him a spoon baby!

ROSS:
 oh yeah? i guess we'll just see!

JOEY:
 yeah! because this commercial belongs to me and mitch!

ROSS:
 you're kid's name is raymond!

JOEY:
 yeah?! so's yours! 

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh it was great! it was great! i went down there just like you said, y'know? and we talked business. kim totally took my opinions.

MONICA:
 you stink!

RACHEL:
 thanks!

MONICA:
 no, i'm-i'm serious!

RACHEL:
 well-well that's 'cause i went down there and they were all smoking. this is actually the smell of success.

CHANDLER:
 okay, there's something different though--oh my god! you smoked!

RACHEL:
 i did not!

CHANDLER:
 yes you did! you look happy and sick; you smoked!

RACHEL:
 all right, fine! but i had too! i had to do it for my career!

CHANDLER:
 i wish i had smoked for my career

MONICA:
 that's so gross!

RACHEL:
 no well, no it's not that bad, y'know? i mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, i actually feel like i can throw up.

CHANDLER:
 okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!

MONICA:
 chandler! i have to tell you, you smell so smokey i have to get up. i'm not kidding. 

CHANDLER:
 i think you smell great!   

 so, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?

 absolutely!

RACHEL:
 i am so on board! 

 rachel didn't you just light that?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i did, but y'know what? i am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? 

 i've actually been thinking about quitting lately.

 oh sure, every sunday night i'm telling myself i'm quitting but every monday morning it's like 

 tell me about it!

RACHEL:
 well then let's just quit! we'll just quit! let's all quit!

 it does sound appealing.

 oh, i never could do it.

RACHEL:
 oh but you could. you can. absolutely! we can help each other out! we can get--what are those--those patches! we could be like the patch sisters!

 oh y'know, we really should quit. okay, let's quit!

RACHEL:
 yes! great! give me those cigs! give it! give it!  

 my late husband gave me that lighter. 

RACHEL:
 okay then!    

JOEY:
 hmmm, soup!   hmm, soup!

 joey, ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching ben for me while i use the ladies' room?

JOEY:
 oh yeah, no problem.

 thanks. 

JOEY:
  it's no picnic. there's tons of rejection. no stability. one day you're dr. drake remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 

  

JOEY:
 hi!

 okay, uh well, let's try one. whenever you guys are ready. 

JOEY:
 uh-oh.

 is there a problem?

JOEY:
 well this is noodle soup and uh, i've been working with tomato. but that's okay, no problem. no problem. hmm, noodle soup.

 y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "hmm, soup."

JOEY:
 oh, what did i say?

 hmm, noodle soup.

JOEY:
 how's that different? 

 all right, let's try one. 

JOEY:
 hmm, noodle soup.

 okay. let's do it again.

JOEY:
 okay. 

JOEY:
 hmm, soup. 

 come on!!!!

 y'know what? we need to move on.

JOEY:
 no! no! i-i can do it one more time! see? look!  hmm, noodle soup. damnit!  

RACHEL:
 hey! hey-hey-hey!!

 uh-oh, busted!

RACHEL:
 come on you guys! what are doing?! i thought we were the patch sisters!

 yeah. that didn't work out.

 rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!

RACHEL:
 well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! come on, give me one of those! what are we talking about?

 no. no! you're doing great! dont you give up! that's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.

RACHEL:
 oh wait, no-no-no! drag me down. drag-drag me down.

 forget it rachel! we're both so proud of how well you're doing. i'm not gonna let you blow it. in fact, if i catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. so go on, get out of here! go on, i don't want you breathing this stuff! go on!

RACHEL:
 okay. 

 

RACHEL:
   

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey.

ROSS:
 listen man, uh, i'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.

JOEY:
 yeah right! 

ROSS:
 no really, i-i am! i feel bad!

JOEY:
 yeah? well look ross, you don't have to. okay? it's not your fault i suck. i mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "hmm, noodle soup."  

ROSS:
 yeah y'know what? maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.

JOEY:
 what you do mean?

ROSS:
 i think, sub-consciously

JOEY:
 wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.

ROSS:
  ben would get the part.

JOEY:
 well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  yeah! it's not that i'm a bad actor

ROSS:
 no!

JOEY:
 no, it's just ah, i care so damn much about little ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.

ROSS:
 there you go. thank you!

JOEY:
 thank you! so, did-did he get it?

ROSS:
 no.

JOEY:
 eh, what are you gonna do? ending credits  

CHANDLER:

 oh, she doesn't come down here any more. you can find her up on ten.

CHANDLER:
 okay, great. 

  whole presentation yesterday at lunch  enough  absolutely!"  

ROSS:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

ROSS:
 wow! you look nice. what's the occasion?

CHANDLER:
 monica and i are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at ja george.

ROSS:
 wow! how'd you get in there?

CHANDLER:
 made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at

30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.   

 hi chandler!

CHANDLER:
 hey caitlin! somebody got a haircut.

 ugh, i hate it! i look like an 8-year-old boy.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.

 it's uh, 27 dollars even.

CHANDLER:
 oh, okay.  

 hey, where's the chicken?

CHANDLER:
 oh, he's in the back. the duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.

 

CHANDLER:
 okay, bye! 

ROSS:
 what the hell was that?!

CHANDLER:
 what?

ROSS:
 the flirting! aren't you supposed to be going out with, i don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!

CHANDLER:
 i was not flirting.

ROSS:
 it was totally flirting. "somebody got a haircut  "

CHANDLER:
 okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. and second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. that is all.

ROSS:
 yeah, right.

CHANDLER:
 you wanna see flirting? i'll show you flirting.  

ROSS:
  opening credits 

RACHEL:
 i am so proud of joey, i can't believe he's going to be on law & order!

PHOEBE:
 i know. but don't you think that it should be called order and law?

RACHEL:
 no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.

PHOEBE:
 don't get me started on that. 

CHANDLER:
 i was not flirting.

ROSS:
 and on your anniversary, for shame!

RACHEL:
 what's going on?

ROSS:
 chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!

CHANDLER:
 i was not and oh god, shh!

ROSS:
 well i'm sorry but you were! okay? and besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.

PHOEBE:
 sounds like somebody wants to be mr. pizza delivery girl.

ROSS:
 well

CHANDLER:
 is that what this is about? you like caitlin? 

RACHEL:
 ross! we broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. i think it's okay that we see other people.

ROSS:
 well, i-i was watching her the other day at the pizza place.

RACHEL:
 hm-mmm.

ROSS:
 and she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little

RACHEL:
 okay, y'know what? we don't need her measurements. 

PHOEBE:
  ross, i know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! she forgot my vegetarian!

ROSS:
 this is perfect! she'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, i'll turn on the charm-o-ross. oh i'm so glad you don't eat meat.

PHOEBE:
 see? vegetarianism benefits everyone.

JOEY:
  remember my grandmother!

RACHEL:
 big night!

PHOEBE:
 this is so cool!

CHANDLER:
 so, joey on law & order, you must be very proud!

JOEY:
 chandler, she doesn't understand a word of english.

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry, i thought you were joey's other grandmother.   i've done it again.

JOEY:
 she's my biggest fan. yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.   understand one word, we'll move on to the english portion of the show. not, that i'm english. not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that i'm not. y'know i think i should shut-up now and move on. anyhoo, she says something about joey being fat i think 

JOEY:
 yeah, i uh weighted like 27 pounds when i was born so

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 happy anniversary, 10 months! 

MONICA:
 so umm, when i was in the shower i was thinking about our first night in london

CHANDLER:
 uhh, joey's grandmother is right there. 

MONICA:
 is that the one that speaks english or the one that doesn't?

CHANDLER:
 the one that doesn't.

MONICA:
 that was some hot love you gave me! i'm gonna go get ready.

CHANDLER:
 hey, why don't you wear those earrings i gave you?

MONICA:
 that's a great idea! i was saving them for something special.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 but i like it here!

MONICA:
 you gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? chandler wants me to wear them tonight.

PHOEBE:
 okay, well i think that they're in my purse. why don't you go get dressed and i'll look for them.

MONICA:
 great!

PHOEBE:
 okay!  borrowed.

RACHEL:
 oh, umm, okay, yeah, i'll be, yeah i'll be right back.    to joey's grandmother. she is quickly exorcised and returns to speaking in english. of course, too most people english is a strange language as well. but none of them are probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. so why am i talking  

JOEY:
 wow pheebs, you speak italian?

PHOEBE:
 i guess so.  

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 wait, rach! where's the other one?

RACHEL:
 oh what, you-you want both of them?

PHOEBE:
 rachel karen green, where's the other earring?!

RACHEL:
 okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but i kinda lost it. i know it's in the apartment, but i definitely lost it.

PHOEBE:
 well, what am i going to tell monica? she wants to wear them tonight!

RACHEL:
 tell her to wear her own earrings.

PHOEBE:
 these are her earrings.

RACHEL:
 nooo! nooooo! you lent me monica's earrings?! i'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!

PHOEBE:
 why not?

RACHEL:
 because i lose her stuff!  rest of the episode takes place in monica and rachel's apartment. why are they called 

JOEY:
 okay, see that blind guy right there? i'm gonna bash his head in later. 

JOEY:
 oh umm, my big scene is coming up. big scene coming up.

CHANDLER:
 if you said, "big lima bean, bubbling up." would she understand the difference?

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh boy, i just can't watch. it's too scary!

MONICA:
 it's a diaper commercial.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!! 

 pizza delivery!

ROSS:
 i'll get it! i will get that! 

 hi!

ROSS:
 hi!

 one uh, vegetarian pizza. that's $12.15.

ROSS:
 oh. uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. i happen to like 8-year-old boys.

 what?!

ROSS:
  thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and i'm just saying i like it. the hair.

 oh. thanks.

ROSS:
 you understand i don't actually like 8-year-old boys.

 y'know, all i'm looking for is the money.

CHANDLER:
 here you go. 

 i'm gonna try. 

CHANDLER:
 you're welcome.

ROSS:
 you couldn't let me have her, could ya?!

CHANDLER:
 what?

ROSS:
 this is a girl that i really like and had too swoop in there!

MONICA:
 what's goin' on?

ROSS:
 chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!

CHANDLER:
 thank you for that! 

MONICA:
 it's okay. i don't care. it's uh, it's fine.

ROSS:
 really?!

CHANDLER:
 really?!

MONICA:
 it's no big deal, i do it all the time.

CHANDLER:
  guys all the time?

MONICA:
 sure! it doesn't mean anything! just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you!

CHANDLER:
 okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than i am.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 chandler, this actually bothers you?

CHANDLER:
 yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. rachel, when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?

RACHEL:
 uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.

ROSS:
 and thank you, for that.

RACHEL:
 but y'know, i never really had anything to worry about. ross was never very good at the flirting thing.

ROSS:
 what? 

RACHEL:
 oh! y'know what? you're right! we meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!

ROSS:
 all right, all right. you-you-you know what i'm going to do? i am going to order another pizza and when caitlin gets here, you-you--i will show how well i flirt. yeah! i will, i will get her phone number! 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 ohh! thank god! where was it?

PHOEBE:
 on your dresser.

RACHEL:
 okay that is the one we already have!

JOEY:
 okay, here's my big scene. my big scene's here!   oh my god.

MONICA:
 what?

JOEY:
  she finds out.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
  commercial break 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
  they dumped me off of days of our lives she almost died.

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
  fault.

CHANDLER:
  soon?

 

JOEY:
 soon, soon, i'm gonna be on soon. there i am!  

 

JOEY:
 no-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.

 no, it's sam waterston! crimes and misdemeanors, capricorn one.

CHANDLER:
 doesn't know, "hello." but she knows capricorn one. 

MONICA:
  leave as soon as the show is over.

PHOEBE:
 but i already gave them back to you!

MONICA:
 no you didn't.

PHOEBE:
 all right, i already didn't give them back to you, that's what i said. 

RACHEL:
 it's not here pheebs, it's not here. ohh, i went to joey and chandler's last night! okay! 

PHOEBE:
 make sure you check chandler's jewelry box.

RACHEL:
 wait a minute. chandler has a jewelry box?

PHOEBE:
 okay, we have like ten minutes. do you want me to get into that now?! 

ROSS:
  ya? you and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 do you like it?

PHOEBE:
 no, that would be, "why are you being cute?"

ROSS:
 okay, i'm working on my flirting.

PHOEBE:
 ohh! i did not get that. 

CHANDLER:
 so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order?

MONICA:
 yeah, it's good.

CHANDLER:
 see, i'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area!

MONICA:
 chandler!   okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.

CHANDLER:
 oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up. look, i'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.

MONICA:
 go on, teach me something about men and women.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i've already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, "i'm just flirting, no big deal." but the guy is thinking, "finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!"

MONICA:
 no way!

CHANDLER:
 it's true.

MONICA:
 well that's pathetic!

CHANDLER:
 again true.

MONICA:
 and this goes for all guys?

CHANDLER:
 all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.

JOEY:
  haven't told her!

ROSS:
 joey! this is like the last commercial. you've got like  ten minutes left!

JOEY:
 i know, i know! what am i going to do? 

MONICA:
 no! you are not gonna run out and leave her here!

JOEY:
  

 joey!

CHANDLER:
 uh, joey is gonna be right back. right back!   meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 did you find it?

RACHEL:
 the earring? no. but look, i found my sunglasses under the couch! i've been looking for these since like last summer. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.

RACHEL:
 okay, calm down, here they are. 

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 i don't know, i don't know.

PHOEBE:
 all right well, we're just gonna have to tell monica, that's all.

RACHEL:
 oh gosh, she's going to kill me.

PHOEBE:
 i suppose i could tell her it's just all my fault.

RACHEL:
 ohh that'd be great!

PHOEBE:
 mon, can i talk to you for a sec?

MONICA:
 yeah, what is it?

PHOEBE:
 umm, i lost one of your earrings. i'm sorry! i am so, so sorry!

MONICA:
  you lost it.

PHOEBE:
 i will replace it, i promise. i feel so terrible.

MONICA:
 all right, sweetie that's fine. you didn't do it on purpose.

PHOEBE:
 no. 

MONICA:
 look at you! come here! 

PHOEBE:
 yeah! you're the best!

RACHEL:
 okay, wait a minute. wait a minute, i-i-i, i can't do this. listen honey, this is, it's not phoebe's fault. she lent me the earrings, and i lost it. i'm so sorry. honey, i feel terrible too. 

MONICA:
   okay?! i mean, first it's my jewelry! and if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! and if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!

RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh, right! 

 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

 caitlin!

 caitlin!

ROSS:

 it's uh, $12.50.

ROSS:
 okay,  wood-burning ovens?

ROSS:
 gas? wow! intense.

CHANDLER:
  problem.

ROSS:
 

   yeah.

ROSS:
 they put that in.

 what?!

ROSS:
 the gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.

 

ROSS:
 a lot of other gas smells

CHANDLER:
 oh the humanity.

ROSS:
 meth-methane smells

 y'know what umm, actually i, i really, i should go.

ROSS:
 oh but i-i-i haven't paid you yet!

 y'know what? that's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!  

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 more so than anything else.

PHOEBE:
 i-i-i found it interesting.

RACHEL:
 i'm sorry.

ROSS:
 look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! in nine years, she and i will be right there. 

RACHEL:
 okay, well, i'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.  

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 yeah?

PHOEBE:
 what else do they add smell too? 

RACHEL:
 hey! hey!  the ones with all the pizza?

 oh, is there a problem?

RACHEL:
 no. no. every thing's--they're fine. great pizza. but it's uh, actually umm my friend ross. he uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.

 oh my god! that was flirting?!

RACHEL:
 yeah.

 wow!

RACHEL:
 i know, i know, but uh just, i'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.

 the guy with the gas?!

RACHEL:
 yeah. i'm-i'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. and besides, i y'know, i think he really likes you.

 really?!

RACHEL:
 well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?

 i just, i thought joey was there.  

RACHEL:
  uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than i thought.

ROSS:
 what do you mean?

RACHEL:
 well, i don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. 

ROSS:
 and she just gave you this?

RACHEL:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 rach, thanks but uh, i don't need you doing me any favors.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 ohh, thank god! finally!

MONICA:
 okay, i've broken them down into categories. okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know and then what i've done is i've cross-referenced them by subject. right? so if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get photo 152. see? 

RACHEL:
 ohh, it's me and la poo! wow! i miss that dog.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 okay.   

RACHEL:
 oops. sorry! well, good thing you number all of them, huh?

MONICA:
 i hadn't! photo 152 was a prototype. 

RACHEL:
 ohhhh. honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. i'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? maybe a margarita?

ROSS:
 ross has the blender! ugh, everything's just falling apart!

RACHEL:
 no honey, it's okay! listen, i'll got to ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.

MONICA:
 all right, he's keys are in the drawer. y'know what? i also need some cash.

RACHEL:
 okay, you want me to stop at the atm?

MONICA:
 nah, while you're at ross's if you see any lying around

RACHEL:
 what?!

MONICA:
 what?! i-i-i don't, i don't do that!    

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 it is starting to get dark out there.

ROSS:
 

 yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.

CHANDLER:
  

ROSS:
 oh hey, gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?

 it's called the cherry.

ROSS:
 it's thechandler!! 

JOEY:
  in the world!

 hey joe does it have meatballs on it?

JOEY:
 oh-ho, yeah!

JOEY:
 yep!

 yeah, you can't eat that in my car.

JOEY:
  this car.

CHANDLER:
 your tax dollars?

JOEY:
 yeah, okay. 

CHANDLER:
  really does smell good.

JOEY:
 did i say you could smell it?!

CHANDLER:
 i can't smell your sandwich?

JOEY:
 half the taste is in the smell! you-you're sucking up all the tastiness!

CHANDLER:
 okay, i'll give them back.   look! what is so great about that sandwich?

JOEY:
 okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

JOEY:
 are you thinking about monica?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 yeah, what's that like?  the kitchen. as she does, she knocks something off of a bookcase next to the kitchen door 

RACHEL:
 ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! please! please! please! please! please! please! please! please!   made in mexico! yes!! ugh, who would buy this?!  finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone 

MONICA:
  

RACHEL:
 hey! what's up?!

MONICA:
 i need a few more things to make the margaritas. uhh, i need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.

RACHEL:
 so all we have is ice?

MONICA:
 see if he has ice.

RACHEL:
 okay.  lying out, stops, reaches down to pick it up, the phone rings causing her to drop it, she 

   i know this is out of the blue but uh, i'm getting married tomorrow. well, maybe i am. i keep thinking about you and i'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. are you thinking about me? of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. okay, bye.

RACHEL:
 oh. oh!  

ROSS:
 so where are we going next?

 this witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.

CHANDLER:
 sur-surprise him? we're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?

JOEY:
 come on man!  a little bit before he lawyers up?

 it's a witness not a perp. and no one talks like that!

ROSS:
 yeah, no one talks like that!

JOEY:
 oh what? like your mr. cop!

ROSS:
 hey, i'm more cop than you two!

CHANDLER:
 how do you figure that?

ROSS:
 hello! i'm in the front seat, okay? i'm gary's partner!

CHANDLER:
 y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. it, it sounds gay.

ROSS:
 umm, jealous! 

 hey, do you mind? we're under cover here.

ROSS:
 yeah, no problem. 

 ross!

ROSS:
 sorry! sorry! oh,   hey gary, who am i? phone home!   

CHANDLER:
 look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors.

JOEY:
 yeah, what's up with that serpico? 

  but if you are, call me tonight. okay, bye.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 well thank god you were here! i mean, we have to erase that!

RACHEL:
 what?! we can't do that!

MONICA:
 we have too! i mean what if ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? is that what you want? ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy emily? the emily that wouldn't let him see you?

RACHEL:
 noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still doesnt give us the right to erase his message!

MONICA:
 i'm his sister, okay? i love him! i don't want to see him get hurt! come on! doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him?

RACHEL:
 i don't think he's the one who needs help. 

MONICA:
 no, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? i mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.   okay, fine! but i mean, look at the position she's putting him in! what's he gonna do? ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! i mean, who would do that?!  all right, but that's y'know, it's different! although it did involve a lot of the same people.

RACHEL:
 ugh!

MONICA:
 y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.

RACHEL:
 okay, you are crazy! i'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! i mean, listen!  

 your messages have been erased.

RACHEL:
 noooooooo!  

CHANDLER:
 okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down!

 no. but that reminds me, 

ROSS:
 what is it?

 oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.

CHANDLER:
 

 okay, here he comes. what is he doing? what the hell is he doing?!

ROSS:
 what? what? what? what is it?

JOEY:
 is everything okay?

CHANDLER:
 what's going on?

 okay, he sees us. now don't move. don't look at him.  slowly throws his body over ross. gary is shocked at what he sees while chandler is 

 hey, it's okay. it was just a car backfire.   hey, look at that! you tried to save your buddy. you see that? you see what he did?

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 uh-huh. thank joey!

CHANDLER:
 uh, hello!!

JOEY:
 hi. commercial break  

MONICA:
 all right, i guess we should go.

RACHEL:
 no, wait. wait.

MONICA:
 oh yeah right! 

RACHEL:
 no, monica! monica! we have to fix this!

MONICA:
 there's nothing we can do. you erased the message!

RACHEL:
 yeah well unless we tell him.

MONICA:
 well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, i can't argue with you! all right? fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. i just don't want to be a part of it. 

RACHEL:
 oh, maybe that's emily calling back to leave the exact same message.

ROSS:
  feeling. you are lucky to be alive! so live everyday to the fullest. love yourself, okay? okay. oh, and also get stamps. bye! 

MONICA:
 wow! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away!

RACHEL:
 right?  

 hey, anybody want to meet a hero?

PHOEBE:
 

 no, joey!

ROSS:
 pheebs, we had the most incredible night! okay, so, we're in the car

 wait! hold on!  hi!

PHOEBE:
 hi!

 

ROSS:
 okay, okay, so we're in the car. right? and bang! a shot was fired. and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!

PHOEBE:
 my god, joey!

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 yeah, but-but he didn't know that!

JOEY:
 yeah, i didn't know that.

ROSS:
 and it could've just as easily have been a bullet.

 hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you.

CHANDLER:
 who jumps at loud noises!

ROSS:
 wow! i could've died tonight.

CHANDLER:
 yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.  

ROSS:
 i do have a newfound respect for life.

CHANDLER:
 

 

PHOEBE:
 yeah! sure! yep!  i'd throw my body on you.

 oh yeah? well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.

PHOEBE:
 okay!

 all right.

PHOEBE:
 bye! 

 bye! 

JOEY:
 cut it out ross! i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! 

JOEY:
 dude! how come you took off? 

CHANDLER:
 oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever

JOEY:
 is something wrong?

CHANDLER:
 no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk.

JOEY:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 you dove in front of ross! ross!

JOEY:
 that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross!

CHANDLER:
 i do not hate ross!

JOEY:
 of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture.

CHANDLER:
 what picture?

JOEY:
 i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing!

CHANDLER:
 look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!

JOEY:
 ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! iknewyou could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he's not street like us!

CHANDLER:
 when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line.

JOEY:
 well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich.

CHANDLER:
 from a bullet!

JOEY:
 i know it doesn't make much sense

CHANDLER:
 much sense?!

JOEY:
 look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it!

CHANDLER:
 so you risked your life, for a sandwich!

JOEY:
 i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is   the greatest sandwich in the world!

CHANDLER:
 so you didn't uh, choose ross before me.

JOEY:
 no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother!

CHANDLER:
 really?!

JOEY:
 yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me,   here.

CHANDLER:
 thanks. 

JOEY:
 no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog! 

JOEY:
 how good is that?

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 see?

CHANDLER:
 hm-hmm. 

JOEY:
 oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!

CHANDLER:
 i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.

JOEY:
 yeah. with a bite!   gets interrupted by hearing ross at the door. she panics and throws the thing into the 

RACHEL:
 hey! hi!

ROSS:
 rach, what uh, what are you doing here?

RACHEL:
 hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!

ROSS:
 y'know, it-it doesn't matter. the important thing is that you're here. you're my friend, and you're here. oh! 

RACHEL:
 okay, just a little scared. what's going on ross?

ROSS:
 the most amazing thing happened tonight. i thought my number was up. i had an actual near death experience!

RACHEL:
 what?! what? what happened?!

ROSS:
 okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right? 

RACHEL:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 and somebody took a shot at me!

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 no, a car backfired, but  was taking a shot at me. and rach, ii survived! and i was filled with this-this great respect for life. y'know? i-i want to experience every moment. i want to seize every opportunity. i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now.

RACHEL:
 because a car backfired?

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 well, i-i-i don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, emily called you today.

ROSS:
 you talked to her?

RACHEL:
 no, she left a message.  it-it kinda got erased. there's just 

ROSS:
 well, okay, what-what did she say?

RACHEL:
 well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.

ROSS:
 wow!

RACHEL:
 now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right?

ROSS:
 huh? yeah! yes, of course!

RACHEL:
 okay. thank you! thank you! becausei'm sorry, all right. because y'know what? she didn't want menot important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right. 

ROSS:
 right. i guess, i guess i should call emily.

RACHEL:
 okay, no, that's not the right decision. that's not, that's not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?

ROSS:
 okay, look, yesterday i would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience. i mean, that-that has got to mean something!

RACHEL:
 ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!

ROSS:
 you weren't there! okay, maybe this is something that i-i'm supposed to seize! y'know?

RACHEL:
 okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff.

ROSS:
 huh.

RACHEL:
 i mean, look-look today you escaped  y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?

ROSS:
 that does make sense. because i do wanna seize some opportunity, but i-i really don't wanna see or talk to her.

RACHEL:
 well, there you go!

ROSS:
 yeah. maybe today is just, close call day.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 hey, thanks rach. 

RACHEL:
 ohh, honey no problem. okay. 

ROSS:
 oh wait-wait-wait! the message is blinking. maybe you didn't erase it. 

RACHEL:
 oh? 

ROSS:
  yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.

RACHEL:
 no. 

ROSS:
  here?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 yeah, i want my money back.

RACHEL:
  right?  ending credits 

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real?

PHOEBE:
 yes. once. yeah, a little. he kinda did it to himself. it's not really a good story.

ROSS:
 i wonder how i would react under fire, y'know? and not backfire but-but heavy fire, like i was in a war or something.

MONICA:
 man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys.

CHANDLER:
 before or after you were shot by your own troops?

ROSS:
 i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.

CHANDLER:
 yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.

JOEY:
 yeah, hero sandwiches. 

 

PHOEBE:
 i'm fine, thanks.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. i'm gonna get some tea.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 hiya doin' pumpkin?

PHOEBE:
 nope.  

MONICA:
 so it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?

 i know, really well. in fact, i'm gonna ask phoebe to move in with me.

MONICA:
 

 what do you, what do you think?

MONICA:
 i think that is so great! when are you gonna ask her?

 tonight, but don't say anything. okay?

MONICA:
 i swear, i promise. i promise. oh my god, i'm so excited! {and i just can't hide it! i'm about to lose control and i think i like it! sorry, just couldn't resist it.} all right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. okay? because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral

 

PHOEBE:
 okay. bye!  

PHOEBE:
 so, what movie should we see?

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 what?! really?!

MONICA:
 he just told me at the counter. he made me promise not to tell, but i couldn't hold it in any longer!

PHOEBE:
 i can't believe this!

CHANDLER:
  fast!

MONICA:
 relax! it's phoebe! not you!

CHANDLER:
 oh! good for you pheebs, way to go! 

PHOEBE:
 no, but it is fast. isn't it?

MONICA:
 ohhhh!

PHOEBE:
 no, i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready for this!

CHANDLER:
 so, what are you gonna do?

PHOEBE:
 i don't know. i'll just handle iti'll ask you to talk to him!

CHANDLER:
 me?! why me?

PHOEBE:
 because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him aman!

CHANDLER:
 i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? because i'm a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be.

MONICA:
 that is so sweet!  

CHANDLER:
  it. no problem.   opening credits 

JOEY:
 hey ross, is uh, is staten island really an island?

ROSS:
 uh-huh, that's why they call it staten island.

JOEY:
 ohhh. i thought it was like long island.

ROSS:
  island. 

JOEY:
 hey, what time is it?

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 wow! you realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?

ROSS:
 are you serious?!

JOEY:
 yeah. i realized it about a half-hour ago but i didn't want to say anything 'cause i didn't want to jinx it.

ROSS:
 wow! we are pretty good at this! hey! we totally forgot about lunch!

JOEY:
 oh, i-i, i think that's the first time i ever missed a meal!   yeah, my pants are a little loose!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 is monica here? 

 no.

RACHEL:
 all right listen umm, i just bought something i'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl.

ROSS:
 you bought shawn cassidy!

RACHEL:
 noo! i wish! okay, you ready?  

 yeah!

RACHEL:
 okay!   check it out!  buy on the planet. rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. yep, a hairless cat! joey and 

ROSS:
 what-what is it?!

JOEY:
 what the hell is that?!!

RACHEL:
 it's a, it's a cat!

JOEY:
 that, is not a cat! {i have to agree with joey on this one.}

RACHEL:
 yes it is!

ROSS:
 why is it inside out?!

RACHEL:
 excuse me! but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat!

ROSS:
 how much did you pay for that?

RACHEL:
 well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal.

ROSS:
 yeah? how much?

RACHEL:
 a thousand bucks.

ROSS:
 on a cat??!!!!

JOEY:
 it's not a cat!

RACHEL:
 all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!

ROSS:
 free cats do that too, y'know. {which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. if you want a leash, go to the pet shop. if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. now back to regularly scheduled programming.}

JOEY:
 it's not a cat!

RACHEL:
 ugh! look you guys, i'm really excited about this! okay? i don't care what you think! i'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson.   well, what am i gonna call her? fluffy?! 

ROSS:
  long we can throw this ball back and forth? huh?

JOEY:
 uhh, the ball thing.

ROSS:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 hey ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!

ROSS:
 uhh, yeah it would! let's do it!

JOEY:
 okay! 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 what?

JOEY:
 i have to pee. and rachel's in the bathroom!  

JOEY:
 man, i didn't think we were gonna make it!

ROSS:
 i know!   about commitment. and as he's walking through the door he notices a couple of "ladies of the night" sitting there. 

CHANDLER:
 hey ladies! what are you in here for? 

 hey chandler, what are you doing here?

CHANDLER:
 gary, i'm here to report a crime.

 yeah?

CHANDLER:
 it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together.

 

CHANDLER:
 well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me.

 sure. okay.

CHANDLER:
 uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!

 yeah, i-i considered that. i just know it would make me happy.

CHANDLER:
 you mean scared.

 no, i mean happy.

CHANDLER:
 scared? happy?

 chandler, what-what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 i am trying to open your eyes, my man! don't you see, if you lived with phoebe she's always gonna be there. you're gonna get home, she's there. you go to bed, she's there. you wake up and oh yes, she's there!

 i know! i can't wait!

CHANDLER:
 were you're parents happy, or something?

 listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i justi wanna be around her as much as i can.

CHANDLER:
 wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.

 so you know what i'm talking about, right?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica!

 no, it's too soon for you guys.

CHANDLER:
  

ROSS:
 now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws! how did it get there?! {y'know, sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up. but it won't work. i'll always have the last laugh! <manical_laugh.wav> okay, so maybe i'm a little deluded, it's probably just my spellchecker. but, i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt. yay me! anyhoo}

JOEY:
 maybe this should be more of a quiet game. {oh, all right!  geez, i can't have any fun!}

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 hi!

MONICA:
 joey, i left my watch on the counter last night.  it was right here, where is it?

JOEY:
 i don't know.

MONICA:
 all right, come on, i'm-i'm late for work!

ROSS:
 how do you know? you don't have a watch.

MONICA:
 guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!

JOEY:
 oh, i don't know. yeah, can't do it.  

MONICA:
 what?!

ROSS:
 monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!

JOEY:
 yeah, we haven't dropped it in 

ROSS:
 2 hours, 27 minutes.

MONICA:
 really?! 

MONICA:
  work today, i don't feel very good.     wow! uh, for a second there i thought i was really better, but i'm not.   

ROSS:
 hey rach!

RACHEL:
 hey.

ROSS:
 check it out! almost 3 hours without droppin' it!

RACHEL:
 oh, wow! congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.

MONICA:
 rach?

RACHEL:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 you have scratches all over you, what happened?  

RACHEL:
 well, it's my cat.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, i got a cat.

MONICA:
 i don't want a cat!

JOEY:
 oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.

ROSS:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. i mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, i even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. and i swear, i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me i know it's saying, "rachel!"

ROSS:
 doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.

MONICA:
  300!!

RACHEL:
 well, i was gonna let you play with it. 

CHANDLER:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?

CHANDLER:
 yes i did, and i think you should do it.

PHOEBE:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 he's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.

PHOEBE:
 you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! the one thing! and you can't even do that right! god!

CHANDLER:
 im sorry. 

PHOEBE:
 ohh!! god!  here, good for nothing.

 hey chandler.

CHANDLER:
 hey gar!

 

PHOEBE:
 yeah! okay. 

 you look very pretty today.

PHOEBE:
 thanks! okay. 

 here's the thing.

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

 y'know i really want to move this relationship forward.

PHOEBE:
 uh-hmm.

 because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.

PHOEBE:
 no that's not true. if you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. and staying still is good. watch this. 

 phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

 i want you to move in with me.

PHOEBE:
 that is so sweet. but don't you think it's a little too soon? i mean there's so much we don't know about each other.

 

PHOEBE:
 i justi don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.

 

PHOEBE:
 i really don't want to mess up what we have. i'm justi'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.

 

PHOEBE:
 which is why my answer is yes!

 

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh!  commercial break  

ROSS:
  team!

CHANDLER:
 four hours? you guys have been doing this for four hours?

JOEY:
 that's right baby.

CHANDLER:
 all right, let me in.  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 he's a dropper!

JOEY:
 oh yeah, that's right!

CHANDLER:
 i'm not a dropper!

ROSS:
 it's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?

CHANDLER:
 it's throwing and catching!

ROSS:
 all right. 

CHANDLER:
 oh! oh! that's so hard.    

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!

MONICA:
 oh myoh good god!

RACHEL:
  don't know what i'm going to do with this thing!

ROSS:
 baking it didn't help, huh?

MONICA:
 so, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?

RACHEL:
 i tried! they won't take her back.

CHANDLER:
 maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-christ.

MONICA:
 rach, why won't they take it back?

RACHEL:
 well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats?

MONICA:
 look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.

RACHEL:
 no mon that's not the point. i'm out a thousand dollars, i'm all scratched up, and i'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!  

MONICA:
 oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!!  it's okay. man, that was close.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, you almost overreacted to something. 

 

 hey!

 we have great news!

PHOEBE:
 we're moving in together! isn't it great! yay!

 congratulations! congrats!

PHOEBE:
 i know, i'm so excited!

 so am i!

PHOEBE:
 well, you're not more excited than i am! no way! i'm the most excited!

 okay, i'll see you at the station later.

PHOEBE:
 okay, yeah, i'll see you later! don't forget about the moving in!

 all right. 

MONICA:
 so you're moving in with him. what happened?

PHOEBE:
 i couldn't tell him no. he got so sad. maybe it'll be all right. i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money i'll save on stamps.

MONICA:
 why, do you write him a lot?

PHOEBE:
 no, i just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. don't they?

 yeah! that's right. yeah-yeah! yeah! 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out. 

 hey, honey! okay, so did you find any apartments? anything in brooklyn heights?

PHOEBE:
 no, nothing.

 oh really?

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

 nothing at all?

PHOEBE:
 no, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. unless it doesn't have a pool, i need a pool. 

 phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh!  movies. which is really appropriate here, since this is a tv show. what are the odds of 

 take a seat. you okay? you feeling all right?  

PHOEBE:
 

 so you uh, you checked the paper for listings in brooklyn heights, right? you-you checked the post?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. 

 in a minute. you-you checked today's post?

PHOEBE:
 umm, yeah! today's.

 'cause uh, this is today's post  and uh, these are the listings i found.  brooklyn heights, one bedroom.  

PHOEBE:
  bragging!

 let me tell you what i think might be going on.   no-no-no, don't look at the table. look at me.   okay, i think somebody asked someone to move in with them. and i think someone said, "yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. does that sound at all possible to you?

PHOEBE:
 yes. yes! fine! i am someone! you want me to say it? i have doubts! 

 phoebe

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

 phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. i mean it is soon. and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and i just figure that everything i really like. and the things i don't know, i get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.

PHOEBE:
 that's so sweet.

 sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. it's fine! we don't have to move in together. i justi want you to be happy

PHOEBE:
 living with you would make me happy.

 phoebe, you don't have to say that.

PHOEBE:
 no, i really wanna live with you! i wanna move in with you!

 are you sure?

PHOEBE:
 yes. definitely! yes! let's live in an apartment that we both live in! 

 oh that's great!

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

 maybe. i was thinking about getting a cat, i was just going to go to the shelter 

RACHEL:
 oh, terrific! that'll be $2,000.

 what?!

RACHEL:
 okay, a thousand.

 i thought you wanted to adopt your cat.

RACHEL:
 well, i do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.

 okay, yeah, i just wanted a cat. 

RACHEL:
  know how to haggle, so i'm not gonna try and take you on. okay? so $800 and i don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! blind!  the money, and run away! run away!  damnit!   okay, did anybody just hear that? anybody?  catch. the guys are exhausted and sitting around the room. monica is still standing all pumped up and being hyper-competitive yet again. {okay! we get it! she's competitive!!

PHOEBE:
 ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in illinois with a beard of bees. {okay, i must protest this, i've lived in illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}

JOEY:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 oh my god! what does that thing do?

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 all right, i'm outta here!

MONICA:
 i'm kidding! i'm kidding!  

 hi rachel!

RACHEL:
 hey! 

 i'm dr. miller. monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.

RACHEL:
 so were done then!

 almost! but first, we gotta start.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 this is a glaucoma test.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.

 sit down.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 but your chin here.  air in each eye.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:

 here we go.

RACHEL:
 all right.

 123! 

RACHEL:
 i'm sorry. all right, i'll just stay in here this time.   okay.

 ready?

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.

 12 

MONICA:
 y'know what, i'm gonna hold her head.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 that's okay.

MONICA:
 okay. 

RACHEL:
 okay. okay!

 12!  young; you probably don't have glaucoma.

RACHEL:
  hey! what are you doing?! are you crazy!  people's retinas and looked at rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to 

 okay. you've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. i want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.

RACHEL:
 yeah, no, i don't-i don't put things in my eye.

 okay then, i guess we'll see you back here in three months.

RACHEL:
 great!

 and i'll fit you for a glass eye.

RACHEL:
 okay, just give me the damn drops! 

MONICA:
 dr. miller?  d.

 very good monica! you know where they are.

MONICA:
 i sure do!   

RACHEL:
 y'know, i-i gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. my eye is a 100% better.

MONICA:
 they're still in my coat.

RACHEL:
 damn!

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 hey! you ready to go?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? do i need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?  

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 i love you. {there's another continuity error here. before monica says i love you, chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. after she says the line and the camera cuts back to chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}

JOEY:
 man, i wish ross was coming with us! y'know? i'm gonna miss him!

PHOEBE:
 thanks a lot! i just got that jerk out of my mind!

CHANDLER:
 hey, so where are we staying? is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?

JOEY:
 uh no, not really. it's an independent film y'know? so we don't have a real big budget. i figured i'd just stay in your room.

CHANDLER:
 i see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? i mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?

JOEY:
 oh yeah! for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in joey's pocket.

CHANDLER:
 so you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?

JOEY:
 did you not hear the plot of the movie? "she's been dead for ten years." i'm gonna be a millionaire!

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 hey!

ROSS:
 i just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? twenty bucks on black 15.

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 okay!

JOEY:
 okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?

CHANDLER:
 too dry.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 yes.

JOEY:
 dude you said, "no!"

CHANDLER:
 i also said, "yes!"

JOEY:
 you don't think this is going to be a big break for me?

CHANDLER:
 no! 

JOEY:
 i don't believe this!

CHANDLER:
 look joe, i just, i just don't want to get your hopes up real high.

JOEY:
 what are you talking about?! i'm the lead in a movie!

CHANDLER:
 they're not even paying ya! this doesn't even sound like a real movie!

JOEY:
 y'know what? i don't need this! okay? i don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.

CHANDLER:
 joe, i don't think this is going to be your big break.

JOEY:
 is that why you're on this trip, huh? make me feel like a loser? 'cause if it is, i'll tell ya, i-i-i'd rather be alone.

CHANDLER:
 oh, you don't want me on the trip?

JOEY:
 not if you're gonna be like this!

CHANDLER:
 all right, i'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that i'll lie.

JOEY:
 yeah! i don't want you on the trip!

PHOEBE:
 that game should not be played without my supervision. 

CHANDLER:
 well, i don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, i didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 y'know, he won't even talk to me. how am i going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 no, don't-don't say i'm sorry with porn!

PHOEBE:
 that is so weird! i had a dream that you'd have lunch with richard.

MONICA:

MONICA:
 the strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but i didn't feel anything at all!

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 okay this is great, but joey said he didn't want any of us out there.

MONICA:
 oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! plus we get to have our own, ani-vegas-ary! a-nevadaversary!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i think we should see other people.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 oh, but i've got tickets to the van gogh exhibit! i've been waiting like a year for this.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 what'd you say?

CHANDLER:
 i said art lover.

ROSS:
 is that supposed to be an insult?

CHANDLER:
 i don't know, i'm very tired. 

ROSS:
 so rach, maybe you and i could fly out together saturday.

RACHEL:
 that sounds great.

ROSS:
 yeah? all right i'll call the airlines. 

RACHEL:
 okay. yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.

RACHEL:
 no! so i can be by myself. y'know? have a little alone time.

PHOEBE:
 naked alone time.

RACHEL:
 no! phoebe just because i'm alone doesnt mean i wanna walk around naked. i mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh! why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?  

PHOEBE:
 so, so far is this trip to vegas better or worse than the trip to london?

CHANDLER:
 so it's pretty much the same pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 okay, what about after i give you these candies?  

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i guess it's a little better now.

PHOEBE:
 ah-ha! okay,  back.

MONICA:
 aww! i love you!

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 i love the "i forgot the present" fake out!

CHANDLER:
 how do you feel about the, "i really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?

MONICA:
 oh that's okay. dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.

CHANDLER:
 ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!

PHOEBE:
  richard thing.

CHANDLER:
 what-what richard thing?

PHOEBE:
 oh no. 

CHANDLER:
 what richard thing?

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 okay, i umm, i ran into richard yesterday and he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did. the only reason i didn't tell you is because i knew you'd get mad and i didn't want to spoil our anniversary.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 really?!

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! it's no big deal. 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 i'm so sorry.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 i knew you were not okay with that.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 when you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 there's not gonna be a next time! you can not ever see him again!

MONICA:
 i can not see him? i mean, you can't tell me what to do!

CHANDLER:
 that's so funny, because i think i just did!

MONICA:
 oh y'know what? if you're gonna be acting like this all night, i really, i don't even want to be around you.

CHANDLER:
 fine with me!

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

ROSS:

JOEY:
 hey, y'know in roman times this was more than just a hat.

CHANDLER:
 really?

JOEY:
 yeah, sure! sure! they would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! they would use it to get the mud off their shoe. and sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right

CHANDLER:
  this is how i'm spending my anniversary.

JOEY:
 all right well, i'll take you someplace nice then. look! a guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.

CHANDLER:
 whoa!

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. can you believe that? $5,000!

CHANDLER:
 y'know, if i won $5,000 i'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit richard from behind with a stick! 

JOEY:
 wait a minute! why don't i do what that guy did? i'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! and then i'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!

CHANDLER:
 good luck! 

JOEY:
 chandler! i don't need luck. i have thought this through!

CHANDLER:

 good.   i should really start wearing hats!  signature song is playing in the background   it's not unusual, y'know, "it's not unusual to be loved by anyone! it's not unusual to have fun with anyone!   but when i see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry!   i wanna die." well, while that's playing he spots monica playing craps and   asleep against his shoulder. she shifts a little bit and ross suddenly gets an idea. an evil idea when he looks at his pen. then we have a little time lapse, the plane has landed 

  vegas.

JOEY:
 itll be great! we-we could talk, and play games! huh? this could be our chance to like renew our friendship.

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 look, i just dont think monica and i are ready to get married yet! yknow? i mean, i love her and everything but seeing ross and rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that monica and i are moving so fast. yknow? and, how do i tell her without crushing her?

JOEY:
 oh! tell her shes not marriage material.

CHANDLER:
 what?!

JOEY:
 girls say it to me all the time! and believe me, if shes anything like me, shes just gonna be relieved. 

MONICA:
 how do i tell chandler that its too soon. its gonna break his heart, hes not gonna think that i dont love him anymore.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 yes i do!

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 what are you guys gonna do?

RACHEL:
 well, i guess we just find a divorce lawyer? 

CHANDLER:
 well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this ones free, right? because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free.

ROSS:
 laugh it up, but the jokes on you. because we dont need to get divorced, okay? we were just gonna get an annulment. 

JOEY:
 an annulment? ross! i dont think surgerys the answer here.

PHOEBE:
 oh-oh, thats your thing.

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 youre thing. youre thing. yknow? youre the guy who gets divorced.

 oh yeah!

ROSS:
 no-no, thats-thats not my thing! i do not love getting divorced!

PHOEBE:
 yes you do! this is your third divorce! you love divorce so much youre probably gonna marry it! then it wont work out and youre gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.  

MONICA:
 so, what do you think we should do?

CHANDLER:
 i dont know. but i-i-i know i love you!

MONICA:
 i know i love you! 

CHANDLER:
 so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? i love you.

MONICA:
 thats a good question. look umm, last night we let the dice decide. maybe we should leave it up to fate again. i love you!

CHANDLER:
 yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  sign that we should get married.

MONICA:
 all right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married.

CHANDLER:
 sounds great.

MONICA:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 ohh, okay, im sorry. youre right. yknow what? we absolutely can stay married, because i was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. all right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what youre asking of me.

ROSS:
 im asking you to do me a favor. 

 does anyone else want to smack ross right about now? raise your hands. okay, put them down before you stink out the person next to you.}

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
  thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, ross, is we can not stay married.

ROSS:
 i dont know if its true.

RACHEL:
 oh b-b-but it is!

ROSS:
 oh, okay, yknow what this is? this is a difference of opinion. and when that happens in a marriage...

RACHEL:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 well, what if all my stuff was here?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 okay. what if we lived together and you understand what im saying?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 dont be worried about that! your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! it could say, ross geller, good at marriage! yknow? mines gonna say phoebe buffay, buried alive.

ROSS:
 look, all i know is i-i cant have another failed marriage!

PHOEBE:
 so okay what? youre gonna be married to a girl who doesnt even know about it?!op, woman! sorry.

ROSS:
 well, okay so, i dont have it all worked out quite yet. just dont say anything to rachel, please?

PHOEBE:
 rachel is one of my closest friends.  one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. okay! 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey rach!

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 sorry, mix up. hey, how was the movie?

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 yknow when we move in together, can i get a gumball machine?

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 no, no, i keep trying, yknow? i can get out, "joey, i have too" but then i lose my nerve and i always finish with, "go to the bathroom." he may think im sick.

MONICA:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 hmm, something bad to tell rachel bad news for rachel, what could that be?!

ROSS:
 could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? all right? my life is an embarrassment! i should go live under somebodys stairs!

PHOEBE:
 ross, its not that big a deal! so youll been divorced three times, youll still have a life, youll go on dates

ROSS:
  dating barrel now. the only guys below me will be four divorce guy uh, murderer guy, and-and, geologists.

PHOEBE:
 ross, youre being ridiculous! okay? you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!

ROSS:
 oh yeah? have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?

PHOEBE:
 yknow thats really fair. yknow? most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. ross, nobody cares about this except you! this-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! here, ill show you! come here.

ROSS:
 what?! why?  sitting. now, im going to go out on a limb and say that their names are stephanie, karin, and meg. okay, so i looked at the credits. of course, only meg is named later on, so ill have to guess who is stephanie and who is karin. but, well cross that 

PHOEBE:
  for the third time, but wouldnt you date him?

ROSS:
 and if you wait right here, ill go get ross.   

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 wow that was my scariest voice! youre very brave. 

RACHEL:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 ugh, the worse day! yknow, you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you raquel.

CHANDLER:
 hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me sha-la-lap. 

RACHEL:
 i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel! by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky!

CHANDLER:
 well, i-i still think youre very-very nice and very pretty

RACHEL:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 yes, we are.  

RACHEL:
 and chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know raquel cant be late.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 ohh! this is so exciting! oh god  come and knock on my door

MONICA:
 

 ill finish that one for those of you who dont know what theyre talking about. where the towels are hers and hers and his, threes company too! yeah, thats the theme song for threes company.} commercial break  

ROSS:
 once you know the stories, its not that bad. first marriage, wifes hidden sexuality, not my fault. second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. third marriage, well they really shouldnt allow you to get married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face, nevadas fault.

PHOEBE:
 okay, so what do you think ladies? who wouldnt be interested? who wouldnt want to date him?

 well the divorces dont bother me, id date him. but, not while hes still married.

PHOEBE:
 okay, what about you? 

 actually, im dating at all anymore. see, i figured out that i was only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me, so until i work that out

PHOEBE:
 

 well, i dont care about the divorces either, but i wouldnt date him. its just that hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl.

ROSS:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
  this rachel girl." 

ROSS:
 this is crazy! i mean, yes-yes rachel is my good friend and i-i have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?

PHOEBE:
 well, i thought you loved her when you-when you married her.

ROSS:
 we were drunk! i wouldve married uh, joey with that amount of alcohol!

PHOEBE:
 hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!! 

ROSS:
  dont want to be divorced three times.

PHOEBE:
 yes, and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. i must say, "well done!" bravo meg.

ROSS:
  the whole three divorce thing! okay, i-ill go to my lawyers office right now and get this marriage annulled! okay?! because she means nothing to me! noth nothing!!

 okay now i wouldnt date you because you seem a little creepy.

 i am so attracted to him right now.  

CHANDLER:
 okay, when are we gonna tell rachel what is actually gonna happen?

MONICA:
 soon! i-i just couldnt before. you saw how upset joey got! i couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend!

CHANDLER:
 well, joeys my best friend.

MONICA:
 im not your best friend?

CHANDLER:
 you just said of course youre my best friend. would you please tell rachel though?

MONICA:
 all right, all right, at least im prepared.

CHANDLER:
 okay.  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey-hey!

MONICA:
 these arent for you! are you upset?

CHANDLER:
 i am now!

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 okay, bye! 

MONICA:
 rach, theres something uh, important i have to tell you.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 no! but, im throwing this shirt away! i think there was a little misunderstanding before.

RACHEL:
 um-hmm.

MONICA:
 umm, when i said that uh, that chandler and i wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.

RACHEL:
  that.

MONICA:
 oh no sweetie, no! this is my fault, i wasnt clear! im really sorry. and listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? theres absolutely no rush.

RACHEL:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 okay. dont you want a cookie?

RACHEL:
 sure? 

MONICA:
 maybe, do you need a tissue? 

RACHEL:
 monica, where did you get these?!

MONICA:
 i made them!

RACHEL:
 ooh, good god, theyre so yummy!   

JOEY:
 god, its gonna so weird like when i come home and youre not here. yknow? no more joey and chans. no more j and cs. "you wanna go over to joey and chandlers?" "cant, its not there."

CHANDLER:
 look, im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.

JOEY:
 yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.

CHANDLER:
 not once did we do that.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hi.

MONICA:
 so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah? well, howd she take it?

MONICA:
 really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didnt cry. she wasnt angry or sad. 

CHANDLER:
 and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?

MONICA:
 i mean, all im asking for is just a little emotion! is that too much to ask after six years?! i mean what? are-are-are rachel and i not as close as you guys?! i mean do we not have as much fun?! dont i deserve a few tears?!! i mean we-we told joey, he cried his eyes out!

JOEY:
 hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! its like the end of an era! no more j-man and channies!! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?!  

 you got married again.

ROSS:
 yes.

 so thats your second marriage in two years.

ROSS:
 yes, second in two years. third overall.

 ross, i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client. why dont you tell me what happened.

ROSS:
 basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk

  you said at the altar in the second marriage?

ROSS:
 yes-yes-yes! but, i-i do not love her.

 oh, thats better then.

ROSS:
 this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled.

 i see. have you considered therapy?

ROSS:
 i think just the annulment for today.

 there are a couple of forms to fill out.

ROSS:
 easy.

 and well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.

ROSS:
 no problem.

 and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge.

ROSS:
 ooh! theres no way to do this without her? cause i kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.

 of course you did. look ross, you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there.

ROSS:
 uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel?  i will think about the therapy. 

RACHEL:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey. so um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.

RACHEL:
 okay!

MONICA:
 yknow, no point in dragging it out. dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.

RACHEL:
 okay.

MONICA:
 hey rach, what about this?  who-who gets this? see, i dont know if i want it because it might be yknow, too many memories!

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 i dont know.  rachel, you want the big plate? i want you to have the big plate.

RACHEL:
 wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate!

MONICA:
 something to remember me by!

RACHEL:
 mon, honey youre not dying. im just moving out. yknow, i mean were gonna see each other all the time.

MONICA:
 but still, its a big change. the end of an era, you might say!

RACHEL:
 are you okay? youre not blinking.

MONICA:
 im fine! i just, im thinking how much its an end of era.

RACHEL:
 oh, all right. but yknow i gotta say, i dont, i dont think six years counts as an era.

MONICA:
 an era is defined as a significant period of time. now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you!

RACHEL:
 what is the matter with you?!

MONICA:
 what is the matter with you?!! why arent you more upset?! arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! i mean arent you gonna miss me at all?!

RACHEL:
 all right, fine, but dont get mad at me. its-its just a little hard to believe.

MONICA:
 whats hard to believe?

RACHEL:
 well yknow, its you guys. you-you do this kind of stuff! yknow? i mean, you-you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess im not upset because i dont see you guys going through with it. im sorry.

MONICA:
 rachel, its going to happen. chandler is gonna move in here.

RACHEL:
 but i

MONICA:
 no-no, wait! just let me finish, okay? this isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in vegas, this is something we both really want. and it is going to happen.

RACHEL:
 it is? really?

MONICA:
 yeah, sweetie.

RACHEL:
  gonna live together anymore?

MONICA:
 no.

RACHEL:
 what? oh my god! im gonna miss you so much! 

MONICA:
 im gonna miss you! 

RACHEL:
 i mean its the end of an era!

MONICA:
 i know!  

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 oh no.

PHOEBE:
 so? did you get the annulment?

ROSS:
 i couldnt.

PHOEBE:
 i knew it! because you love rachel.

ROSS:
 its not that. okay? annulments are more complicated than i

PHOEBE:
 yeah, complicated cause of the love.

ROSS:
 i i do, i do not love rachel. im gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. okay? would i do that if i loved her?

PHOEBE:
 ive never been more convinced of your love for her.

ROSS:
 i do not have feelings for rachel! okay?!   

ROSS:
 ohh, whats wrong?!

RACHEL:
 monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing.

ROSS:
 oh mycome here! come here!  everythings gonna be okay.

RACHEL:
 thank you.

ROSS:
 of course.  ending credits 

JOEY:
 so, ross and rachel got married, monica and chandler almost got married, do you think you and i should hook up?

PHOEBE:
 oh we do, but not just yet.

JOEY:
 really?! well, when?

PHOEBE:
 okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it wont work out.

JOEY:
 wow.

PHOEBE:
 i know. then, im gonna marry chandler for the money and youll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids.

JOEY:
 great!

PHOEBE:
 but then we ditch those two and thats when we get married. well have chandlers money and rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachels drinking problem.

JOEY:
 oh-oh, what about ross?

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!   pinches joeys nose shut. in a few seconds, joey has to move because hes now

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute?

CHANDLER:
 pheebs, i dont understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?

PHOEBE:
 maybe because you never listen to anything that i say. i talk about her all the time! denise!!!!! 

JOEY:
 hey rach, listen i was thinkin uh, im gonna have an extra room over at my place

RACHEL:
 oh, thats true.

JOEY:
 yeah, why dont you move in with me? itll be great! we could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about naked thursdays right?

RACHEL:
 yeah, yeah i think im gonna find my own place.

CHANDLER:
 hey-hey! i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man! opening credits  

PHOEBE:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 so, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?

ROSS:
 oh, that. umm, she took it really well.

PHOEBE:
 you didnt tell her did you?

ROSS:
 no. 

PHOEBE:
 of course not, because youre in love with her.

ROSS:
 i am not in love with her. she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. i-i just comforted her, as a friend.

PHOEBE:
 what do you mean, comforted her?

ROSS:
 its nothing, i just gave her a hug.

PHOEBE:
 ah-ha! a classic sign of love, the hug!

ROSS:
 its also a sign of friendship.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, not in your case lovey loverson.  

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?

ROSS:
 s-s-smell her hair? what if i did?

PHOEBE:
 ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head! thats why, thats why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them!  scientist. 

ROSS:
 i was hugging her as a friend. its not my fault her-her hair got in my face, shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty.   what?! oh, that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel! maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts!

PHOEBE:
  right? rachels not in the same place you are.

ROSS:
  love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place!

PHOEBE:
 okay, i didnt understand that, but yknow, maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love!   using the magazine as a decoy because she grabs his cookie and coffee, takes a bite out of  

JOEY:
 hey! 

CHANDLER:
 who was it?

JOEY:
 i dont know! how about, "thanks for taking the message." jeez! 

MONICA:
 okay listen, yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?

CHANDLER:
 sure!

MONICA:
 okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! okay, whatever, i really havent thought about it that much.

CHANDLER:
 well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big-big ones!

MONICA:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 okay so you mean no as in, "gee chandler, what an interesting idea. lets discuss it before we reject it completely."

MONICA:
 oh, im sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.

CHANDLER:
 so, thats it?

MONICA:
 i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.

CHANDLER:
 which is why asteroids is perfect! its the oldest game!

MONICA:
 what do you have against the beautiful guest room?

CHANDLER:
 i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!

MONICA:
 are you mocking me?

CHANDLER:
 no, im not mocking you,  guest room.  

JOEY:
 hey, whats up?

CHANDLER:
 nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight.

JOEY:
 but youre still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today. 

CHANDLER:
  non-ugly." nice!

JOEY:
 yeah? i just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? someone i can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me. and whats more different than me; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19? enh?  not just a hat rack my friend! 

RACHEL:
 pheebs, i have to ask you

PHOEBE:
 shhhhhh! im swamped right now.

RACHEL:
 youre just staring into space.

PHOEBE:
 umm, im trying to move that pencil.  

RACHEL:
 this one? 

PHOEBE:
 it worked!

RACHEL:
 pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this;   "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." its just, there is nothing! the citys full!

PHOEBE:
 wait, no, look at this!  two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay" oh, yeah, but its on the ground floor.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hey.

ROSS:
 rach, uh, you still looking for a place?

RACHEL:
 yeah! why?

ROSS:
 okay, theres this guy, warren, from the museum and hes going on a dig for like two years and hes got this great place he needs to sublet. so uh, you interested?

RACHEL:
 that sounds great! id love to live at warrens!! i love warren! thank you!

ROSS:
 dont thank me! if you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. 

RACHEL:
 oh, this is great! i am gonna call him right now!  you!   

ROSS:
 okay, you go grab it!

PHOEBE:
 i saw it.

ROSS:
 i dont know what youre talking about.

PHOEBE:
 umm, im talking about that which you already know but wont admit. you love her again; you re-love her!

ROSS:
 look, i do not re-love her.

PHOEBE:
 i cant believe you wont just admit it!  promise me that you wont do anything stupid.

ROSS:
 look, were just friends now! okay? why would i do anything stupid?

RACHEL:
  subletted! i mean, this is just hopeless. im never gonna find anything.

ROSS:
 you can live with me.

RACHEL:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 what?!

ROSS:
 what? commercial break 

RACHEL:
 oh my god! are you serious?!

ROSS:
 uh-huh. 

RACHEL:
 i would love to live with you ross; thats-thats great! thank you!

ROSS:
 well, im-im just glad i could, yknow, help you out.

PHOEBE:
 wow! im-im so happy for you guys.  not stupid.

RACHEL:
 ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me! i mean, i mean i was gonna be homeless. you just saved me! youre my hero!

ROSS:
 hero, i uh, i dont knowwell, all right.

RACHEL:
 oh, i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has!   

ROSS:
 oh please!  arent ya?

PHOEBE:
 no. no, i wont. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and thats how she ended up living with me!  thats a lie. 

CHANDLER:
 hi.

MONICA:
 hi.

CHANDLER:
 hi, listen, im sorry about before. i dont need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldnt get girls, and now i can emnow, i have you.  that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women

MONICA:
 stop it chandler. 

CHANDLER:
 really?

MONICA:
 yeah! oh yes!

CHANDLER:
 ohh.

MONICA:
 listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.

CHANDLER:
 thats a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.

MONICA:
 totally! 

CHANDLER:
 we dont have to come up with this now.

MONICA:
 oh good.

CHANDLER:
 hey, yknow what? why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room?

MONICA:
 changes?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. 

MONICA:
 youre-youre-youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here?

CHANDLER:
 is that a problem?

MONICA:
 well, its a set and they should probably stay together.

CHANDLER:
 oh, thats cool. then ill just bring them both over.

MONICA:
 see now-now youre taking them away from their home.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!

MONICA:
 yeah-yeah, yknow what? yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! thats-thats what i said! oh come on, chandler! im talking about the barca lounger! it just, it doesnt match! where is it gonna go?!

CHANDLER:
 in the game room!

MONICA:
 look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!

CHANDLER:
 all right! thats fine! thats fine! i wont bring over the chairs! i wont bring anything over! i wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandmas place!!   

JOEY:
  your application looks really goodohh! just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?

 oh dont worry, im not really a party girl.

JOEY:
 whoa!! now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?

CHANDLER:
   hi! ill be living here. 

JOEY:
 oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i dont think hes gonna get it.

CHANDLER:
 why did you take the shower curtain down?

JOEY:
 that thing was a hazard!  conscious.  

RACHEL:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey! oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff.

RACHEL:
 oh thanks, but listen, i was just at monicas and she and chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.

ROSS:
 what do you mean, theyre not moving in? they-theyre still moving in right?

RACHEL:
 no-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.

ROSS:
 what?! over a stupid room!

RACHEL:
 yeah, i feel kinda bad for them, but im also really psyched cause i dont have to move in here!

ROSS:
 oh no, yeah no, that parts great!  

ROSS:
 whats all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly!

MONICA:
 ross, we can handle this.

ROSS:
 well, apparently not, and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!

CHANDLER:
 well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!  

ROSS:
  both a long time, and ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?

CHANDLER:
 well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.

MONICA:
 love is the best medicine.

CHANDLER:
 thats laughter.

MONICA:
 why do you do it?

CHANDLER:
 i dont know.

ROSS:
 okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i do.

ROSS:
 and mon, you wanna live with chandler, dont ya?

MONICA:
 yes.

ROSS:
    

 so i understand youre looking for a place.

RACHEL:
 no-no, im staying put.

 oh, i was going to offer you my apartment.

RACHEL:
 why, where are you going?

 i dont know.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hi!

ROSS:
 youre never gonna believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again. thats great news righti mean for them. right?

RACHEL:
 oh wow.

ROSS:
 yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.

RACHEL:
 yeah. yknow umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but dont you think its gonna be weird?

ROSS:
 wh-why?! why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?

RACHEL:
 well, because of us! because of our history.

ROSS:
 no!

RACHEL:
 no?

ROSS:
 no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place?

RACHEL:
 no! not at all!

ROSS:
 good! me neither! so its not a problem. were just two friends who happen to be roommates.

RACHEL:
 okay, but ross, eventually you and i are gonna be dating.

ROSS:
 really?! we are?

RACHEL:
 yeah! im gonna have a boyfriend, youre gonna have a girlfriend

ROSS:
 ohh! that would be great.

RACHEL:
 but yknow what, if you think its gonna be okay well just work out a system. yknow, itll be like college, ill hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "come back later, im gettin lucky." 

ROSS:
  that.  he can try to manipulate the situation so that its best for ross, not necessarily 

ROSS:
 so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean its a really big step! and-and whats the rush?! 

MONICA:
 thats very funny!

CHANDLER:
 hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!

ROSS:
 no, i-i-im serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing yknow you break up!

MONICA:
 ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.

ROSS:
 okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isnt about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents! and unfortunately, this room   could destroy you!!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i'm not so worried.

MONICA:
 yeah, no, me neither.

ROSS:
 fine! its your life!  attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last  i just dont want to see you guys break up! which you will do if you move in together,  theres nothing i can do.  it!!!!! 

MONICA:
 you still want to move in together right?

CHANDLER:
 of course!

MONICA:
 ross didnt scare you?

CHANDLER:
 scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.

MONICA:
 come here, i want to show you something!

CHANDLER:
 okay!  the coffee table forward 

CHANDLER:
 oh my god! someones killed square man!

MONICA:
 this is where i thought the barca lounger could go! you see you could see the tv and its still walking distance to the kitchen.

CHANDLER:
 oh thats so sweet! i want to show you something too!

MONICA:
 okay!

CHANDLER:
 yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge?"

MONICA:
 uh-hmm.

CHANDLER:
 yknow? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. because, thats you and i together! merge!

MONICA:
 oh my god! i love that!

CHANDLER:
 really?!

MONICA:
 uh, no!!

JOEY:

ROSS:
 ive been back and forth.

JOEY:
 yeah well, maybe you should go back! okay? rachel moves in, and before you know it youre right where you dont want to be! back together!

ROSS:
 ehh, i dont, i dont think so. shes already talked about yknow, dating other guys.

JOEY:
 thats not gonna work out! then shes gonna come home all weepy and youll be tellin her, "oh thats okay. youll find someone." and then, bamn! she finds you!

ROSS:
 yeah, well, m-maybe youre right.

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day! commercial break  

JOEY:
 

 hi!

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 ross, i know what youre thinking.

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 that shes gonna move in with you and maybe then shell fall in love with you and then when she finds out youre already married, shell just be happy. yknow? youre just, youre very sad.

ROSS:
 ohmygod! i-i see what this is! you are in love with rachel!

PHOEBE:
 what?!!

ROSS:
 of course! it all adds up! i mean you youre obsessed with her. its always, "ross, what are you gonna do about rachel?" "ross, why-why are you moving in with rachel?" "when are you gonna confess your secret marriage to rachel?" you want her!

PHOEBE:
 no! 

ROSS:
  

MONICA:
 hey rach, arent these candlesticks

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and i know you guys dont know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.

MONICA:
 phoebe thats crazy!

JOEY:
 i cant believe she would say that too you.

RACHEL:
 yeah honey you dont believe her do you?

PHOEBE:
 i dontshe said yknow that id have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black.

CHANDLER:
 just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?

PHOEBE:
 no, cause she didnt tell me i was gonna die until the very end of the session, and i was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! i mean ive only got a week left, yknow? ive really gotta start living now!  picks up the latest copy of car and driver

ROSS:

JOEY:
  piece of paper?

ROSS:
 ohh! okay! okay.  are three   these theories  into"

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

 ohh! were kidding! oh, were kidding!

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 oh-ooh-ooh! yknow whats a good visual aide?

ROSS:

JOEY:
 why not?!

ROSS:
 i-i-i dont even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it. yknow what? im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.

CHANDLER:
 thats the way i did it til i was 19.  

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey! any good mail?

CHANDLER:
 yes, you got something from the screen actors guild.

JOEY:
 ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, im kinda.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 hmm thats weird. i dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.

CHANDLER:
 okay, its not a check. theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.

JOEY:
 let me see that!

CHANDLER:
 all right.

JOEY:
  i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? and it wouldnt matter. now i gotta be careful?!

CHANDLER:
 im sorry man, theres never a good time to  catching on fire.

JOEY:
 all right well, i guess i gotta go get a job. im gonna go see my agent.

CHANDLER:
 okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.

JOEY:
  street.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 it went great! and i didnt need any jokes or naked chicks either!

RACHEL:
 wow, thats great ross, im sorry we werent more supportive before.

ROSS:
 i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself. everyones all, "ross you have to be funny and sexy." well, i proved them wrong! and now, im gonna pass the news onto joey and chandler.

MONICA:
 that youre not funny or sexy?

ROSS:
 thats right! 

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 yeah!

 oh well, no harm, no foul.

JOEY:
 estelle, you gotta get me some work. i-i lost my health insurance.

JOEY:
 why?

 well, i think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
  tomorrow and ill have my health insurance back in no time.

CHANDLER:
 thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 whats wrong with you?

JOEY:
 nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. but um, i dont think its anything serious.

CHANDLER:
 this sounds like a hernia. you have toyou-you go to the doctor!

JOEY:
 no way! kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 hey, will you grab me a cruller?  sit down! will you go to the hospital?!

JOEY:
 dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing.

CHANDLER:
 i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and lets just get that thingpushed back in.

JOEY:
 thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i dont want that hanging over my head. okay? besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want! yeah, im thinking ill probably start with that laser eye surgery too. 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 whats going on?

CHANDLER:
 oh joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!

JOEY:
 look, im telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here  puts his hand down his pants, like al bundy on marriedwith children always  it doesnt hurt that bad.

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 yeah that seems fair. we never use them.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 well

MONICA:
 why dont you phase it out? yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in america.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i mean, come on ross, no one will even notice. i mean theyre probably not even listening!

ROSS:
 theyre not listening too me?

RACHEL:
 of course theyre listening to you! everybody listens to you.

ROSS:

MONICA:
 i think you look fine.

RACHEL:

 yes, this russell, rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since i havent heard from him, i assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.

RACHEL:
 ross got married againnooooooo!!!!!!!!! 

ROSS:
  phasing it out. so without out re-testing the results in the laboratory   the team would never have identified  their carbon dating analysis   yes. 

 whats happening to your accent?

ROSS:
   really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. im sorry. so, if we could just get back to the lecture. umm, were there any questions?  about paleontology.  make a good first impression. obviously, i screwed up. but what you guys think of me is really important because im-im hoping to get a permanent job here. so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression  

RACHEL:
 ross!! are you crazy?! i am still your wife!! what, were you just never gonna tell me?!! what the hell is wrong with you?!!!! ugh, i could just kill you!!!!

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 youre kidding!

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 ross!

ROSS:
 okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. but i just couldnt face another failed marriage.

CHANDLER:
 okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?

ROSS:
 rach, come on, if you think about it, its actually kinda funny.   okay, maybe its best not to think about it.

PHOEBE:
 okay, this is inexcusable. i am shocked to my very core!

ROSS:
 phoebe, i told her you already knew.

PHOEBE:
 another lie. you have a sickness!

CHANDLER:
 ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to anymore of us are ya? opening credits 

JOEY:
 oh! hey, somebody left their keys. 

 oh come on! who would leave the keys to their porsche behind? if i had a porsche, id have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} hey gunther, these yours?

 yeah, thats what i drive. i make four bucks an hour, i saved up for 350 years!

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 well, i didnt realize until i got home. i wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! yknow what? im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield. 

CHANDLER:
 oh good, when he comes back for his keys, ill be sure to give him your shoe.

JOEY:
 great! thanks. 

PHOEBE:
  how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!

MONICA:
 oh my god, what a fun day! that sounds great!

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay, well ill bring them by tomorrow morning. okay, and uh, by the way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre frank and alices triplets. okay, see ya! 

CHANDLER:
 whoa-whoa-whoa! what?

PHOEBE:
  and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and im nervous cause ive never done that before by myself!

MONICA:
 dont worry about it phoebe, well absolutely do it.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, im gonna pass. cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies.

MONICA:
 come on chandler, come on! itll give us great practice for when to visit.  

 nice car!

JOEY:
 yeah, its not mine.

 

JOEY:
 yeah, its 

 i bet its fast.

JOEY:
 me too! yeah. and comfortable. do uh, do you like leather seats?

 yeah!

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
 so, i still have boxes here. i still have boxes at rosss, and i have nowhere to live! wow. i could so easily freak out right now.

PHOEBE:
 what about me? i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while, i dont have a roommate.

RACHEL:
 well, maybe-maybe i could be your roommate pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 maybe you could be my roommate!

RACHEL:
 well theres an idea!!

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

RACHEL:
 that would be great! wait, how long is denise gone for?

PHOEBE:
 umm, she said shed be back december 26th. 

RACHEL:
 december 26th, huh maybe shes santa clause. 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 okay, i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and i picked up all the forms. ill take care of everything.

RACHEL:
 well sure, if you say youre gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you. give me those forms!  im gonna do this my way and i dont want to hear a peep out of you!

ROSS:
 okay rach, but

RACHEL:
 op! youre peeping! 

RACHEL:
 ross! yknow what, i just gotwhy? why did you do this?!

ROSS:
 look i told you

RACHEL:
 i dont wanna hear "three failed marriages!"

ROSS:
 look, if youd had two failed marriages, youd understand!

RACHEL:
 well, yknow what? thanks to you im half way there! ugh! oh! i am so mad! ross, i dont think i have ever been this angry!

ROSS:
 what about the time i said we were on a break?

RACHEL:
 ugh!   

MONICA:
 pheebs, hows it going?

PHOEBE:
  think theyre having fun? am i talking to fast?

MONICA:
 nope, sound like me. pheebs, its going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler.

CHANDLER:
 little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben.  smells something. its times like these im glad smell-o-vision hasnt been  do you know what pheebs? when youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. 

PHOEBE:
 na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.

CHANDLER:
 see thats where i think that youre wrong. weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.

MONICA:
 what do you mean?

CHANDLER:
 i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and yknow mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  

PHOEBE:
 that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.

CHANDLER:
 okay, im a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.  

MONICA:
 this is so great! this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.

PHOEBE:
 yeah? 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey babies! oh, im having the best morning. that uh, that porsche ive got the keys too, still there!

CHANDLER:
 shocking! since you still have the keys.

JOEY:
 you should see the treatment i get when im with that car! people are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments.

CHANDLER:
 what equity investments?

JOEY:
 the ones that got me the porsche! will you keep up!   but i figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it. so i figured ill wash it. right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow?

MONICA:
 oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound.

CHANDLER:
 you dont even have a car!

MONICA:
 i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it.

CHANDLER:
 and?

MONICA:
 and six others.

CHANDLER:
 there you are.  

JOEY:
 yeah, she tops out at 130.

 wow!

JOEY:
 and thats just in the city. i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate.

 really! you got a place upstate?

JOEY:
 sure!

 well, ill see you later.

JOEY:
 okay, take it easy.

 hey! thats my car.

JOEY:
 really? oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.

 what-what are you doing?

JOEY:
 oh i-i uh, found the keys and now im just polishing her up.

 but its my car!

JOEY:
 yeah, but its my wax.

 listen, i-i-i dont come to this city much so i dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could i have my keys.

JOEY:
 sure. here. 

 im not coming back.

JOEY:
 why not?

 i live upstate.

JOEY:
 yeah, so did i.   

PHOEBE:
 i dont know why i was so nervous about this. and i dont know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy.

MONICA:
 yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.

CHANDLER:
  can meet krog! 

MONICA:
 chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someones eye out!

CHANDLER:
 he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!

PHOEBE:
 no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.

CHANDLER:
 theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!

PHOEBE:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 glass, sand, whatever.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.

MONICA:
 oh its so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i can still do that.

MONICA:
 how are you still single?!

CHANDLER:
  youre right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.

MONICA:
 good. what made you change your mind?

CHANDLER:
 i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.

PHOEBE:
 how did that happen?!!

CHANDLER:
 well, i was trying to prove that i was right. yknow? and it turns out i was wrong. and now its lodged in my throat.   

MONICA:
 damnit! yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler!  

 okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?

RACHEL:
 yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.

 so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable.

ROSS:
 fine, im mentally unstable.

 and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user.

ROSS:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 uh yes, heroin and crack.

ROSS:
 crack isnt even an intravenous drug!

RACHEL:
 well, you would know.

 now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?

ROSS:
 oh, come on!

RACHEL:
 

 and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin.

ROSS:
 okay, im sorry, this is insane! i-i-im not addicted to heroin, im not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, ill consummate this marriage right here, right now!

 that wont be necessary.

ROSS:
 and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!

RACHEL:
 ugh!

 now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.

RACHEL:
 ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  record?

 is there, anything in this record that is actually true?

RACHEL:
 well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think.

 well, based on what i heard, you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment. if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce.

ROSS:
  your funny, funny form!

RACHEL:
  bunnies nonsense!

ROSS:
 and what typing that for? did you hear what she said? we dont get the annulment. dont type that! what?! stop typing!   hey! stop typing!  stop typing! stop typing!!

RACHEL:
  married too?!

 you need to get out of my chambers.

RACHEL:
 all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one!

ROSS:
 yeah!

 would you like to spend the night in jail?

RACHEL:
 and thank you for your time.  commercial break  phoebe are watching the babies. i cant describe it, youll have to see it when 

JOEY:
  car back.

CHANDLER:
 but you found the keys to his clothes?

JOEY:
 no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.

MONICA:
 and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes?

JOEY:
 of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! right?

CHANDLER:
 that is true.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.

JOEY:
 oh, ive been there. yeah, i am gonna go drive my porsche.  

MONICA:
 joey, you know you dont actually have one.

JOEY:
 come on! what are you doing?! im in character! would you talk to her! 

CHANDLER:
 ahh, i think it just moved. its really poking me.

MONICA:
 all right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.

PHOEBE:
 what?! no, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! were baby-sitting! 

MONICA:
 the babies are asleep, im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!

PHOEBE:
 but you-you cant leave me with them! we-were a team! were playing a zone! theyre gonna triple team me!

MONICA:
 hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.

PHOEBE:
 but no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.

CHANDLER:
 i think thats gum.

PHOEBE:
 im pretty sure its gun.

CHANDLER:
 okay, listen this really hurts. lets go.

PHOEBE:
 a real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!   no! what would, what would krog do?  

JOEY:
 why isnt that valet back with my porsche?

 maybe because youve got the keys?

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
 this is totally your fault!

ROSS:
 my fault?! you threatened the judge!

RACHEL:
 well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!

ROSS:
 that was the only way i could get him to stop typing!

JOEY:
 hi! how are the gellers? 

RACHEL:
 dont call us that! 

ROSS:
 the judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! now we gotta get a divorce!! did a porsch throw up on you? 

JOEY:
 hey! its porsche!!  

PHOEBE:
 me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, im gonna take that spit bubble as, "yeah, i do!" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, ill set you up with a clean one.  the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the  okay, im sorry. i didnt mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? cause lets face it, were at monicas.   i broke it. all right. well, thats just the way that goes.   okay, good.  of you? where is leslie? well, you cant answer.  where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  turns around and finds that leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the tv  well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh!   oh, youre a lot mischievous! well, itll dry.  you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there!    monicas apartment looks like a tornado, a hurricane, a swarm of locusts, fire, brimstone, hail, and giant man-eating, radioactive ants have torn the place apart. needless to say, its messy enough to cause monica to die of shock right away. 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.

PHOEBE:
 okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.

CHANDLER:
 and protected them from a tornado? 

MONICA:
 oh my god.

PHOEBE:
 i know, the babies are asleep.

MONICA:
 phoebe, what, what happened here?!

PHOEBE:
 i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself!

MONICA:
 but my apartment!

CHANDLER:
 was the setting of phoebes triumph.

MONICA:
 but the mess!

CHANDLER:
 is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.

MONICA:
 youre right, youre right i shouldnt freak out. cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?!

CHANDLER:
   

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i picked up the divorce papers. uh, ive already signed everything and i put little xs where you need to sign.

RACHEL:
 oh, little xs! great! that makes up for everything!

ROSS:
 yknow, i-iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too! okay?

RACHEL:
 oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!

ROSS:
 okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding! ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married!

RACHEL:
 hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you!

ROSS:
 yeah! right! 

ROSS:
 youre right. thats very different. so lets, lets just sign the papers. all right? 

RACHEL:
 nothing. 

ROSS:
 okay, can we just sign please?

RACHEL:
 uh-hmm.  

ROSS:
 congratulations. 

RACHEL:
 okay ross, werewait a minute. umm, i uh, i kinda have a little confession.

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 well, yknow this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.

ROSS:
 excuse me?

RACHEL:
 well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?

ROSS:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 and uh, yeah, i didnt really, i didnt want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  into this mess.

ROSS:
 so then if-ifi mean if you think about it, this is all  fault.

RACHEL:
 yeah, dont push it though.

ROSS:
 ive got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you.

RACHEL:
 i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it wouldnt be a secret, and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut. 

ROSS:
 did i, did i even treat?

RACHEL:
 no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.

ROSS:
 that may be the most depressing thing ive heard in my life. i should probably get these to my lawyers office.

RACHEL:
 hey, thanks ross, for taking care of all of this.

ROSS:
 eh, no problem. 

RACHEL:
 im gonna need a copy of those.

ROSS:
 totally.  ending credits  stuff. this guy playing street football catches a pass next to the car cover joey is 

JOEY:
 hey! hey! be careful around my porsche! 

 

JOEY:
 hey! how you doin?

 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 okay, here is the phone bill. 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 thats our phone number. now look, i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont i justwhy dont i just cover you for a while?

JOEY:
 no-no! no way! joey tribbiani does not take charityanymore.

CHANDLER:
 its not charity, joe

JOEY:
 no! forget it! okayi mean thanks, but im done taking money from you. all right, i can take of myself. now, whats next? come on.

CHANDLER:
 okay uh, heres the electric bill. 

JOEY:
 this is how much we pay for electric?!!!

CHANDLER:
 uh, yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 so, well do the rest of the bills later then? opening credits  

PHOEBE:
 so is joey going to have to give up the apartment?

CHANDLER:
 no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it.

PHOEBE:
 well, how much do you think he needs?

CHANDLER:
 i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride.

PHOEBE:
 why dont you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want.

CHANDLER:
 well that would help the pride thing.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow?

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 okay! 

MONICA:
 well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that rachel is moving in with phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 and also, my birthday.

MONICA:
 its not your birthday.

PHOEBE:
 what a mean thing to say! i would never tell you its not your birthday! 

JOEY:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey! so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?

CHANDLER:
 well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.

ROSS:
 whoa-whoa-whoa, knicks season opener tonight. i thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.

JOEY:
 i dont know ross, not if youre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.

ROSS:
 i did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 youre not dressed yet?! were supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!

RACHEL:
 well and clearly not a minute sooner.

MONICA:
 rachel, you are packed though right, i mean please tell me that youre packed. 

RACHEL:
 of course i packed! monica relax! i just wanted to ask phoebe her opinion on what i should wear tonight.

PHOEBE:
 my god, i cant get a minute of peace around this place.  

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! monicas just gonna kill you.

RACHEL:
 yeah, yeah, i know.

PHOEBE:
 well, what youre wearing is fine for that.

MONICA:
  youre not packed even a little bit!

RACHEL:
 surprise!!

MONICA:
 what?

RACHEL:
 no, no dont get mad because lookthis is what happened. so i-i started packing, then i realized, "what am i doing? i am lousy at packing!" right? but you love packing! so, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da! 

MONICA:
  god! im so sorry, i didnt get you anything! okay, look everybody has to help! okay? you can help, cant you phoebe?

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 okay.

MONICA:
 okay!  

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
  movers will be here in 11 hours. rachel has not packed. now, everybody has to help! chandler, were gonna start with

CHANDLER:
 oh nope, i-i have plans with joey.

MONICA:
 i thought you said you were going to do nothing.

CHANDLER:
 yes, but for the last time.

MONICA:
 okay fine, now ross

ROSS:
 oh, but-but i cant do it.

MONICA:
 why not?

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 because, because ive got ben.

MONICA:
 its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. where-where is he?

CHANDLER:
 hes at a dinner party.

MONICA:
 is he really coming? because i can see right into your apartment!

ROSS:
 of course he is! what, do you think id just use my son as-as an excuse? what kind of father do you think i am?

MONICA:
 all right, sorry. 

ROSS:
  

JOEY:
 here it is! our last pizzas together as roommates.

CHANDLER:
 oh, i wish id know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese.

JOEY:
 oh thats okay. hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours! 

CHANDLER:
 say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?

JOEY:
 what, are you crazy? you havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. it would be easier if you just give me your money.

CHANDLER:
 yes it would. what do you say to $50?

JOEY:
 okay, youre on.

CHANDLER:
 okay, lets play! the big game, italy vs. china, apparently.   

RACHEL:
 ohhhhhh, look its the roller blades.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 you remember when we got these?

MONICA:
 no.

RACHEL:
 i guess you werent there. 

PHOEBE:
 you guys, we said we were gonna have fun! come on, hey, remember the time 

RACHEL:
 im sorry pheebs, i guess im just really said that im leaving.

MONICA:
 im gonna miss you so much.

PHOEBE:
 well, this doesnt have to be so sad though. yknow? maybe instead of just thinking about how much youre gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things youre not gonna miss.

MONICA:
 i dont think theres anything.

PHOEBE:
 come on, theres gotta be something.

MONICA:
 nope, shes perfect.

RACHEL:
 i have one.

PHOEBE:
 good! great! you can go first.

RACHEL:
 uh well, i guess im not gonna miss the fact that youre never allowed to move the phone pen. 

PHOEBE:
 good thats a good one. okay, monica, anything? yknow? does rachel move the phone pen?

MONICA:
 aw, sometimes. always, actually.

PHOEBE:
 okay, good. there you go. doesnt anyone feel better?

MONICA:
 not just the phone pen. i never get my messages.

RACHEL:
 you get your messages!

MONICA:
 yeah, well i dont think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.

RACHEL:
 so-so, you missed a message from who? chandler or your mom? or chandler? or your mom?

PHOEBE:
 great! it worked! no ones sad. 

JOEY:
  whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  whoo-ho-ho! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, give me a chance to win my money back. okay? sudden death, one goal, $1,000.

JOEY:
 you serious?

CHANDLER:
 oh yes!

JOEY:
 okay, get ready to owe me!

CHANDLER:
 okay.

JOEY:
 okay, here we go. ready?  ball in, chandler quits playing and goes for his chinese food. joey smacks the ball really hard, shooting it down the table. chandler slowly takes a bite, the ball bounces off of 

CHANDLER:
 no! no! no! no 

CHANDLER:
 see? now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.  

MONICA:
 hello? 

RACHEL:
 ooh, your brother. score!

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 oh, im just over here with ben. i thought wed say hi.

MONICA:
 oh, put him on!

ROSS:
 ben, say hi to aunt monica.   oh, i guess he doesnt feel like talking right now. hes smiling though! okay, talk to you later.  

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i think it was better when you guys were sad. hey, uh, remember the roller blades?

RACHEL:
 you know what else im not gonna miss? "im monica. i wash the toilet 17 times a day. even if people are on it!"

MONICA:
 "hi im rachel, is my sweater too tight? no? oh, id better wash it and shrink it!"

RACHEL:
 "im monica, i dont get phone messages from interesting people. ever!"

PHOEBE:
 hey! i call her!

MONICA:
 "oh my god, i love ross! i hate ross! i love ross! i hate ross!"

RACHEL:
 "oh my god, i cant find a boyfriend! so i guess ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find in there!"  

PHOEBE:
 yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.  commercial break  

CHANDLER:
 still broken?

JOEY:
 this sucks man! the last night youre here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.

CHANDLER:
 well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack? 

JOEY:
 nah, not my game.

CHANDLER:
 okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? we could play a new game. a new game, its fun.

JOEY:
 well, whats it called?

CHANDLER:
 cups.

JOEY:
 i dont know how to play cups.

CHANDLER:
 ill teach ya! come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun.

JOEY:
 all right.

CHANDLER:
 okay, here you go.  what do you have?

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 well thats a full cup! 

JOEY:
 damn! i am good at cups! 

MONICA:
 im not talking to her!

PHOEBE:
 well, one of you has to take the first step! and it should be you, because shes the one whos leaving. its harder for her!

MONICA:
 well, maybe youre rightshe made fun of my phone pen!

PHOEBE:
 i know, i took it hard too. 

MONICA:
 listen rachel, i feel really bad aboutwhat are you doing?  

RACHEL:
 im unpacking!

MONICA:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 im not moving!  picture straight?

MONICA:
 it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!

RACHEL:
 hey, yknow what? youre the one who wants to make this big change and move in with chandler! you should be the one to go! why should i have to leave?!

MONICA:
 because its my apartment!

RACHEL:
 well its mine too! what else you got?!

MONICA:
 how about, youre moving!!  them into a box. what follows is a brief sequence of rachel unpacking and monica packing the same stuff over and over again as rachel chants "no." and monica chants 

RACHEL:
 look! this is ridiculous. we should be packing you!!  

PHOEBE:
 hey, how are you guys doing?

RACHEL:
 great! monicas moving!

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh really?! then how come all your stuff is in this box?!  

PHOEBE:
 okay, you guys. you guys i think i know whats going on here. okay, you guys stop!!  acting mad because you think that itll make it easier to leave. but deep down youre still really sad. deep-deep down.

MONICA:
 no phoebe i am mad!

PHOEBE:
 well, deep-deep-deep down!

RACHEL:
 yeah, im just mad!

PHOEBE:
 then keep running.  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 well, what did you have?

CHANDLER:
 it doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far?

JOEY:
 uh, 

CHANDLER:
 not 700 exactly?

JOEY:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 double it! 

JOEY:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.

JOEY:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 hey, i didnt make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  gonna happen unless you getno way!   

MONICA:
 well, this is the last box of your clothes. im just gonna label it, "what were you thinking?"

RACHEL:
 funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler.

PHOEBE:
 hey you guys, i dont mean to make things worse, but umm, i dont want to live with rachel anymore. 

 what?!

PHOEBE:
 youre just so mean to each other! and i dont want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!

RACHEL:
 well, phoebe thats fine because im not moving.

MONICA:
 whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! yknow i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but yknow rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.

RACHEL:
 oh really? like what monica?

MONICA:
 yknow she has 147,000 pairs of boots

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, good start mon.

MONICA:
 she lets you borrow them.

RACHEL:
 yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet.

MONICA:
 do you wanna live outside?! because its gettin cold!   she gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that id like.

PHOEBE:
 what else?

MONICA:
 when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.

PHOEBE:
 thats nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.

MONICA:
 when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.

RACHEL:
 well yknow, i dont want you to be cold.

MONICA:
 and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive.  now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!! 

RACHEL:
 oh, its gonna be fine.

PHOEBE:
 okay rachel, i cant wait to live with you! and you know what we should do? bring monica and then we could all live there together! well have so much fun!!

RACHEL:
 but honey, i think shes moving in with chandler.

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 kinda.   oh my god!  

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 whats wrong?

JOEY:
 ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in cups!

CHANDLER:
 wh-how did you lose at cups?!

JOEY:
 the same way you lost. i started out with a king and a queen, bamn! ross gets a 2 and a 3. then i get a jack and a king, boom! ross gets a 4 and a 5! ross was getting the cup card, the d-cup, the sittin down bonus! meanwhile, i didnt even get half a cup! nothin!!

CHANDLER:
 oh man!!

JOEY:
 and he never played before either! yknow what i think? i think beginners luck, very important in cups.

CHANDLER:
 all right, lets play one more hand! one more!

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 i cant take the big white dog! you love it!

JOEY:
 its him, not it!

CHANDLER:
 no, but waitwhat if i bought it from you, yknow? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say 

JOEY:
 wait a second, i see what youre trying to do here! you-youre trying to give me money again!

CHANDLER:
 when did i try to give you money?

JOEY:
 over there!  give some charity, i said "no," you dropped it. okay? then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!

CHANDLER:
 im just trying to help you out! okay? i wanna make sure that youre okay.

JOEY:
 i will be okay! look chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that i cant take care of myself. okay? look, im not gonna miss you helping me out with money. the only thing that im gonna missis you. and now the dog.   joey and ross are carrying

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?  

CHANDLER:
 its not a real game! i made it up!

ROSS:
 im sorry you lost your money, but i won it fair and square.

CHANDLER:
 at a fake game!!

ROSS:
 now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, id be glad to play you for it. but i should warn you, i am very good at cups.

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 hey! 

 hey!

MONICA:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 no-no

JOEY:
 oh, oh, you're right! i don't want that. i can't date her!

MONICA:
 yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.

JOEY:

MONICA:
 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 oh! i used to do that too!

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 she's not gonna care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place.

ROSS:
 whoa, hello, did you just meet monica?

CHANDLER:
 she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.

ROSS:
 hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. cause when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.

CHANDLER:
 i see, i see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.

ROSS:
 look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she is going to freakout. oh my god, she's going to sit on you.

CHANDLER:
 no, she's not okay? and i'll prove it to you. i'm gonna call her right now. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey mon, how's it going?

MONICA:
 terrible. if-if i want something done right, i have to do it myself. other people just wreck stuff. i really think i might kill someone tonight. 

CHANDLER:
 oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.

MONICA:
 it's worse. the only thing that's getting me through is knowing that i'm gonna be seeing you soon. i think i may even try to get out of here early.

CHANDLER:
 no! no-no-no-no-no-no. it sounds like they really need you down there.

MONICA:
  well, are you just hanging out with ross?

CHANDLER:
 it's, all good! okay bye-bye mon! 

ROSS:
 yeah, the phone was facing the other way.   and that goes back up there. commercial break 

CHANDLER:
 we should start with the big stuff. yknow? that'll be the easiest. uh, let's start with the couch.  it. 

ROSS:
 yeah that-that, doesn't look right.

CHANDLER:
 what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.

ROSS:
 whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.

CHANDLER:
 ok well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.

ROSS:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.

CHANDLER:
 yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!!!

JOEY:
  drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!   what the hell's going on over here?!?!?  something to-to repel this woman! wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. 

ROSS:
 hey, i've been married 3 times 

JOEY:
 no-no-no i've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. what's your secret?

ROSS:
 look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue.

CHANDLER:
 oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?

ROSS:
 yeah, well what about you? you weren't you know, so hot in college either. after everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, monica doesn't like that either, maybe i should stop doing that. 

ROSS:
 oh y'know what, girls don't like it when i start talking about science.

CHANDLER:
 that's not specific to girls.

JOEY:
 this is great, this is great, what else, what else?

ROSS:
 uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.

CHANDLER:
 and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.

ROSS:
 they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.

CHANDLER:
 man, i'm so lucky i have monica.

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 hey phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?

PHOEBE:
 sure 

RACHEL:
 okay, um, i... just wanted to say that i'm sorry. ok? i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you. 

PHOEBE:
 so, what should you have done?

RACHEL:
 well, i-i should've told you the truth.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh, which is...?

RACHEL:
 well, y'know, the reason i didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...

PHOEBE:
 so?

RACHEL:
 well, it's embarrassing. people were looking at us like we were crazy.

PHOEBE:
 why do you care?

RACHEL:
 because they're people.

PHOEBE:
 but people that you don't know and will never see again.

RACHEL:
 yes, but still. they're peoplewith eyes.

PHOEBE:
 well, i didn't get embarrassed running next to miss  okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you're uptight.

RACHEL:
 i-i am not uptighthey-hey-hey-oh-oh! listen, i am not uptight, man.

PHOEBE:
 that's okay rachel. i'm not judging you; that's just who you are. me. i'm more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. y'know, i mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan?   

CHANDLER:
 okay, is this lamp in the same place?

ROSS:
 who cares? i repel women. 

CHANDLER:
  r-r-r-r-ross is naked.

MONICA:
 what?!

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
  see me naked.

ROSS:
 why does anyone have to be naked?

MONICA:
 why is ross naked?

ROSS:
 i-i had to show chandler something?

MONICA:
 naked?

ROSS:
 yeah-yeah i uh, i have a uh, a guy problem.

MONICA:
 is it the same thing that chandler had?

CHANDLER:
 look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.

MONICA:
 okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye!

CHANDLER:
 bye! thank god

ROSS:
 dude, what'd you have?

CHANDLER:
 look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place.

ROSS:
  the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures.

CHANDLER:
 that's perfect! that's brilliant!  

ROSS:
 so really, what'd ya have? 

 hey joey, i got some beer for you.

JOEY:
 uh, don't you mean "for whom?"

 sure, listen i was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?

JOEY:
 pizza, heh, its not like i never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.

 is there something wrong?

JOEY:
 all right, all right, let's just get this out in the open okay? you're hot. i'm lovable. clearly there's a vibe going on between us. but, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.

 joey...

JOEY:
 no, no, no, i'm telling ya. imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? so the question is, what do we do?

 well, i don't think there is anything to do. i mean i think you're really sweet, but i'm just not interested in you like that.

JOEY:
 oh!

 no! i mean you're a really nice guy and i'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, i'm just y'know, i just don't feel that way about you.

JOEY:
 oh! i see what happened. it's because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you'd feel a lot different if i turned it on.

 i don't think so.

JOEY:
 oh, i do. 

 i'm ok

JOEY:
 what?!?!

 what?

JOEY:
 oh dear god!  

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 oh honey, i'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!

PHOEBE:
 see? and you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!

RACHEL:
 gone! i mean its amazing pheebs. i feel so free and so graceful.   hey! look out for the horse! sorry!   

MONICA:
 is it okay for me to come in now?

CHANDLER:
 uh-huh

MONICA:
 why is everything different?

ROSS:
 bye! 

CHANDLER:
 no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. 

MONICA:
 well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.

CHANDLER:
 okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and i'm sorry, i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.

MONICA:
 it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something? 

CHANDLER:
 do you want me to be afraid of you?

MONICA:
 of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but i'd never expect you to worry about that.

CHANDLER:
 really?

MONICA:
 of course!

CHANDLER:
 oh well you're the best. you come here to me.

MONICA:
 all right, hold on okay? first thing's first.   okay, now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked? closing credits 

ROSS:
 so it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...

 ...and live forever as a machine!

ROSS:
 that's so janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? you and i, we're interfacing.

 yeah, i gotta go.

JOEY:
 hey. 

CHANDLER:
 hi, my names chandler. i just moved in next door and i was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source? 

JOEY:
 sure, neighbor come on in. 

CHANDLER:
 so, is janine around? 

JOEY:
 uh, no, shes at dance class. 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. she gets really mad. 

CHANDLER:
  my god. what is th its like a guy never lived in here. look, youve got to be careful. this girl thing is dangerous.  spreading already. 

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
  couch? 

JOEY:
 no. 

CHANDLER:
  box, thats too small to put anything in? 

JOEY:
 no. 

CHANDLER:
 no! ok, this is not good. you are a guy. ok? this is a guys place. if you let this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff. 

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
 yes talk to her. be a man. 

JOEY:
 im a man. 

CHANDLER:
 defend yourself. 

JOEY:
  

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 ohh, yeah. 

ROSS:
 well, is this hillary your hot assistant chef hillary? 

MONICA:

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

PHOEBE:
 im, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. so, can i come to bloomingdales and use the copy machine. 

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 oh my god. what happened? 

RACHEL:
 i-i, got a job at ralph lauren. 

PHOEBE:
 well thats great! congratulations!!  

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 but, pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where i actually work. but, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. cause kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much. 

CHANDLER:
 thats weird. i dont think my boss likes me either. 

MONICA:
 i dont think mine likes me either. 

ROSS:
 maybe its a universal thing? 

JOEY:
 or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 11:30 on a wednesday.  

CHANDLER:
 yeah lets head off to work. 

MONICA:
 we should go.  

PHOEBE:
 thank you. 

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 hey. uh, can i talk to you for a second? this, uh, kid in this picture. do you, uh, know this kid? is that like a relative or something?

 ohh. like what? 

JOEY:

JOEY:
 look i dont know this baby. i dont know if shes a famous artist or not. you know, and i dont want to be a jerk but youre changing too much around here. 

 well, im sorry. i just thought id try to make the place a little nicer. 

JOEY:
 yeah but its too much stuff. you know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can. 

 well i just thought 

JOEY:
 im sure its a famous watering can, okay. but, come onand what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom? 

 its a curling iron. 

JOEY:
 ohh, well, thats ok then. but, okay my towels for instance. i come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. its up here on some hook..andsmells different.

JOEY:

 its dry. 

JOEY:
 alright, i can make my peace with the clean dry towelsalso what is with these chips you bought?

JOEY:
   

RACHEL:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 i whitened them. 

CHANDLER:
  

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 come on, seriously. 

MONICA:
 ross theyre really, really, really white. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, what was wrong with your oldhuman teeth. 

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 a-a day. 

MONICA:
 ross you know that tonight is your date with hillary? 

ROSS:
 i know. thats why i did it.  that bad? 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 oh, hey, hey rach, do you notice anything..ahh 

RACHEL:
 yeah. your teeth? yes, i saw them from outside.   you guys are never going to believe this. but, phoebe made out with ralph lauren. 

CHANDLER:
 what??? 

MONICA:
 oh my god. 

RACHEL:
 yeah i know. she ran into him at my office and they justmade out. and the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because i told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year. 

CHANDLER:
 i am proud of all my friends today. 

MONICA:
 my god, rachel, i cant believe phoebe made out with ralph lauren. ohh, im so jealous.  

CHANDLER:
 hi, im chandler. your live-in boy 

MONICA:
 chandler, please, come on. look at him.   

CHANDLER:
 oh, i am no women, but that is one tasty dish.  

PHOEBE:
 hey. here.   ohh, whos the silver fox? 

RACHEL:
 that-that is your make out buddy. dont you recognize him?   oh wait. ohh, phoebe i love you. kiss me please. 

PHOEBE:
 thats not ralph lauren. sounds like him though. 

RACHEL:
 what? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, no, ralph doesnt look anything like that guy. hes-hes young and hes got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god, phoebe, thats not ralph lauren. thats kenny the copy guy. 

PHOEBE:
 what? 

RACHEL:
 oh..go..oh..and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren. if she finds out that i lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. phoebe!! 

PHOEBE:
 why would the copy guy say he was ralph lauren? 

RACHEL:
 to get you to make out with him!!! 

PHOEBE:
 ohhh.  

MONICA:
  look less white.  yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple. 

ROSS:
 i dont know what im going to do. that date starts in like an hour. 

MONICA:
 hey ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. your teeth wouldnt look so bright. 

ROSS:
 oh great. so all i need to do is get some new skin. thank you. 

MONICA:
 im just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you. 

ROSS:
 whoa. whoa. whoa. were not 13 anymore. 

MONICA:
 ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working. 

ROSS:
 but, wont she notice i have makeup on? 

MONICA:
 please. half the guys out there have makeup on. 

ROSS:
 what?? 

MONICA:
 all right, half the people. i mean, just try it and see. 

ROSS:
 no. i am not putting on makeup.  

PHOEBE:
 hello. oh good. ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?   oh!! demon!! demon!!   

MONICA:
 now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, god forbid we throw out old underwear. you-you know what? im going to go over to joeys. 

MONICA:
 wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, but i feel like ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. you know. in fact i think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple. 

MONICA:
 you know what? this has been kind of a girlie day. youre right, im sorry. 

CHANDLER:
 nah, nah, its okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing. 

MONICA:
 yeah. go over to joeys. go over to joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall. 

CHANDLER:
 you know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall? 

MONICA:
 when girls hang out, we dont have pillow fights in our underwear.  why i said that.   

JOEY:
 hey chandler. come on in. were knitting pot holders. 

CHANDLER:
 no thanks, josephine.  

CHANDLER:
 hey ross, i was wondering if oh my god!! where are all the men???   

RACHEL:
 ohh, hi, kim. 

 hi rachel. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday? well it didnt happen. 

 you didnt cancel the fabric order from taiwan? 

RACHEL:
 okay, two things didnt happen. remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room? well, it turns out thats not true. 

 thats not true? 

RACHEL:
 no. 

 oh thats interesting? because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, rachel. 

RACHEL:
 oh no, no, no. oh god, you think i made out with him. 

 listen to me. if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job. you are sadly mistaken. 

RACHEL:
 i-i dont want your job. i-i dont. ohh this is such a mistake. i did not make out with him. nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday. i dont even know how to use my keycard.  

 hi ralph. 

: hi kim.  

 yeah, nothing happen. you could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.   

 and after that, what could i do except become a chef. 

ROSS:
 mmm-hmm. 

 and someday soon, i hope to open my own restaurant. 

ROSS:
 mmm. 

 you know, youre a really great listener. most guys i go out with, they just talk and talk. 

ROSS:
 mm-hmm. 

 after a while its like, shut your mouth, you know? 

ROSS:
  

 ive probably been talking too much. why dont we talk about you a little bit? 

ROSS:
 mmm-unmm. 

 come on. i want to know. 

ROSS:
 hmm-hmm-hmm.  long island. i-i came to the city for college. um, i, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time i like to read spy novels. but, but, lets talk more about you. hmm.   

JOEY:
 so whats really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer. 

MONICA:
 oh my god, joey, that is such a great tip. 

CHANDLER:
 monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers. 

MONICA:
 okay. oh but joey, come over later because im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter. 

JOEY:
 ohh, i love birds.  

CHANDLER:
 what is the matter with you ?!? 

JOEY:
 what? 

CHANDLER:
 youre arranging flowers!  got dead flowers! you got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! this is not joey!! 

JOEY:
 hey. hey look i am still joey, okay. flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. of a famous baby. 

CHANDLER:
 youre turning into a women. 

JOEY:
 no im not. why would you say that? thats just mean. 

CHANDLER:
 now ive upset you? what did i say? 

JOEY:
 its not what you said. its the way you said it.oh my god, im a women!!!  

RACHEL:
 now, she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job. 

PHOEBE:
 but why didnt you just tell her the truth. 

RACHEL:
 i did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren. 

PHOEBE:
 well, hey, what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? you know. what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man? huh, did she ever think of that? 

RACHEL:
 you were with kenny today, werent you? 

PHOEBE:
 just for a second. 

RACHEL:
 ohh, phoebe, what am i going to do? 

PHOEBE:
 well, the only thing you can do. sleep with ralph lauren. 

RACHEL:
 im not going to sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i wouldnt. 

PHOEBE:
 ohh, sleep with kenny. 

RACHEL:
 that wouldnt help me. 

PHOEBE:
 ohh, yes it would.  

 ive had a really good time tonight. 

ROSS:
 mmm. 

 you know, i rarely connect with someone this much on the first date. 

ROSS:
  me, neither. ive had a really good time too, you know.  

 are you going to eat that bread? 

ROSS:
   mmmm. 

  

ROSS:
 hmm-hmm. 

 would you like to move over to the couch? 

ROSS:
 mmm-hmm.  

 maybe ill just turn the lights down a little. 

ROSS:
  

 okay.   

ROSS:
   ahh, where were we? 

 are those your teeth?? 

ROSS:
 ohh, you can see them, huh? 

 yes. theyre insanely white. 

ROSS:
 i-i, did that for you. 

 whats a matter with you? 

ROSS:
 whats a matter with me? youve got a black light. its 1999!  

RACHEL:
 kim, hi. 

 hi rachel. ohh, ive been meaning to ask you. have you seen the new ralph lauren sheets? ohh, what am i thinking. of course you have. 

RACHEL:
 okay..okay.. look. im sorry that i lied to you before. you were right. ralph and i were an item but were not anymore. 

 oh, really? 

RACHEL:
  this. even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. i cant do this. im married and im sorry." and then i dont know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. especially not above kim, who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine." 

 you expect me to believe.. 

: hi kim.  

 oh my god. he just gave you the coldest look i have ever seen. its like he hates you. then it is true. 

RACHEL:
 of course its true and it hurts so bad. 

 ohh honey come here.  there. 

RACHEL:
 you and ralph? 

 kenny the copyboy. ending credits   

 hey. 

JOEY:
 hey, uhh, i need to talk to you. 

 whats the matter? are you upset? 

JOEY:
 im sorry but weve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. i, uh, i got to be a man! okay. the living room has to remain a guy place, okay? thats just the way it has to be. 

 well, if thats what you want. ill just put it all in my room. 

JOEY:
 greatgreatand thanks for being so understanding. i mean, i didnt want to make a big deal out of this, you know.   you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. i mean, if you want to. 

 okay. 

JOEY:
 and, uhh, maybe the watering can there. 

 sure. 

JOEY:
 and a couple of these little tiny boxes. 

 joey? do you want me to put it all in your room? 

MONICA:
  guess whos coming to thanksgiving dinner?

CHANDLER:
 sydney portier? hehheh. 

MONICA:
  parents.

CHANDLER:
 oh! thats great, they havent seen the place since i moved in! 

MONICA:
 yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great!  would eat around four. 

CHANDLER:
  together?

MONICA:
 because they dont know were dating.   do you think we should eat in the kitchen?  

CHANDLER:
 why havent you told them?!

MONICA:
 um, well, i was going to, i-i-i really was. but um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, i didnt.

CHANDLER:
 why havent you told them?! wouldnt they be happy?!

MONICA:
  four! ill see you then.  

CHANDLER:
 why wouldnt they be happy?

MONICA:
 well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. im sorry.

CHANDLER:
 what? what? why?!

MONICA:
 maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.

CHANDLER:
 is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?

MONICA:
 look, i know that i shouldve told them. i know i shouldnt care what they think. im sorry. 

CHANDLER:
 yknow, itll be okay. itll be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em.

MONICA:
 you really think thatll work?

CHANDLER:
 hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, didnt i?

MONICA:
  that drunk!  opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 hey!  right? 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 well monica just told me that they dont.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 i dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. or maybe its cause you uh-

CHANDLER:
  

CHANDLER:
 this is great, another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.

JOEY:
 maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin up, eh?

CHANDLER:
 maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment.

JOEY:
 well maybe i love ya.

CHANDLER:
   janine 

CHANDLER:
 hey. 

 hey guys! 

ROSS:
  play video games, joey!

 are you guys going to chandlers for thanksgiving?

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah, why? whats up?

 well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing thanksgiving uptown. i thought you guys might like to come.

ROSS:
 for real?

 no, but you should go to chandlers. because none of us knows how to cook, well probably just end up drinking all day.

JOEY:
 ye-ye, we go to yours!

ROSS:
 yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because its my sister. but, uh, uh yknow actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.

   

JOEY:
 how you got three women to marry you, ill never know. 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey! hey, pheebs, check it out. yeah, for my desert, i have chosen to make a traditional english truffle!

PHOEBE:
 wow, that sounds great! and what are you making monica, in case rachels dessert is... theres none left for anybody else! 

MONICA:
 nothing.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 no, sweetie, i-i trust you.

RACHEL:
 so, if-if i mess this up, theres nothing else for dessert?

MONICA:
 youre not gonna mess it up.

RACHEL:
 wow, monica, i love that, you really have faith in me. thank you. technical question, how do you know when uh, the butters done?

MONICA:
 well, its done about two minutes before it looks like that. 

 hey!

 hey!

JOEY:
 oh, ooh the food smells great, mon!

ROSS:
 and the place looks so nice!

JOEY:
 yeah, hey hey, happy thanksgiving everybody!

ROSS:
 happy thanksgiving!

 happy thanksgiving!

JOEY:
 well, this has been great!

ROSS:
 see ya! 

MONICA:
 whoa whoa whoa! wherere you goin?

ROSS:
 oh, oh, we did say wed stop by this little thing joeys roommate is having.

MONICA:
 oh, janine, the really hot dancer girl?

ROSS:
 some would say shes attractive, yes.

PHOEBE:
 and who else is going to be there?

JOEY:
 uh, some of her friends, yeah.

RACHEL:
 her dancer friends?

JOEY:
  there and theyre gonna be, be drinkin and dancin, and we really wanna go!

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 youre not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and youre gonna eat here!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very thanksgivingy.

ROSS:
 oh, but-but it is, uh, its just like the first thanksgiving, when the indians and the pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah, and the indians taught the pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world! 

 hello everybody!

 hi!

 hi! 

MONICA:
 dad  chandler!

 

CHANDLER:
 mr. and mrs. geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!  

CHANDLER:
 whoa, snowing out there?

   of the table, mr and mrs geller are to his right. joey and ross are to his left. monica is 

 monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living. 

 ok, i have dandruff. theres no need to laugh and point. 

MONICA:
 dad, chandler was just laughing at your joke.

 my joke wasnt funny. 

PHOEBE:
 rach, rach, i just remembered. i had a dream about mr. geller last night.

RACHEL:
 really?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! and its making me look at him totally differently. yknow, i mean he used to be just, yknow jack geller monica and rosss dad and now hes hes jack geller, dream hunk." 

RACHEL:
 i dunno. yknow to me hell always be jack geller, walks in while youre changing.  

MONICA:
 yknow dad, chandler is one of rosss very best friends!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ross sure is a great guy, yknow ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.

 i always thought that too. tell me, what does your father do? 

CHANDLER:
   

JOEY:
 rach, youre killin us here, will ya serve the dessert already? those drunken dancers are waiting! 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 yeah, yeah, what is it?

RACHEL:
 its a truffle. its got all of these layers. first theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch,  beef sauteed with peas and onions,  a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top! 

ROSS:
 w-what was the one right before bananas?

RACHEL:
 the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, yknow, i thought well, theres mincemeat pie, i mean thats an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, yknow.  oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place?

JOEY:
 y-sure!

RACHEL:
  a taste.

  

ROSS:
 beef in a dessert?! i- no no no, there is no way! 

JOEY:
 i know, and only one layer of jam?! what is up with that?  only to find that they are sticky. so one page is overlapping another, making two recipes 

ROSS:
 oh my god, the pages are stuck together!

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 oh my god, she-she made half a english trifle, and half a...sheperds pie!

JOEY:
  get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!

ROSS:
 no, no, we will. we just wont tell her she messed up.

JOEY:
 just let her serve the beef-custard thing?

ROSS:
 yeah, itll be like a funny thanksgiving story!

JOEY:
  funny... 

RACHEL:
 joey, god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!

JOEY:
 did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?

RACHEL:
 no!

JOEY:
   

PHOEBE:
 rachel?

RACHEL:
 yeah?

PHOEBE:
 okay, look at him. look at those strong hands. oh what i wouldnt give to be that can of    

MONICA:
 mom, uh, chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.

 oh, thank you chandler! i just bought it.

CHANDLER:
 oh, yes. well its very beautiful. its cream-colored and tight   i dont mean tight, i mean its not too tight, not that i was looking at- 

 whats the matter with him?

 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
    

ROSS:
 okay, i think i might know why my parents dont like you.

CHANDLER:
 you do? why?

ROSS:
 okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.

CHANDLER:
 what?! why did you do that?

ROSS:
 i dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, im im sorry. i-i didnt think it would matter.

CHANDLER:
 how could it not matter?!

ROSS:
 how was i supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?

CHANDLER:
 what about all that friends forever stuff?

ROSS:
 i dont know, i-i was all high.  commercial break 

MONICA:
 mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get ross stoned!

CHANDLER:
 your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!

MONICA:
 ross, i cant believe youd do that!

CHANDLER:
 the reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?

ROSS:
 okay, okay, ill tell em it wasnt chandler who got high. now who should i say it was?

MONICA:
 you! its not like its a big deal! you-you dont still do it or anything!

ROSS:
 alright, alright, now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it?  teeth with his feet on the table. phoebe and judy are sitting on the table looking at him. ross and chandler are sitting by the window talking. rachel and joey are in the kitchen 

MONICA:
 dad, please dont pick your teeth out here! alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-

PHOEBE:
 monica, leave him alone! 

JOEY:
  that all of janines friends are dancers?! and that theyre going to be drinking alot!?

RACHEL:
  romantic.

JOEY:
 well youre whippin so slow! cant you do it any faster?

RACHEL:
 joey! come on! i dont wanna make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's gonna be like oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle? 

RACHEL:
 so why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?

JOEY:
 oh i am! 

MONICA:
 ross, if you dont tell them, then i will!

ROSS:
 okay, fine!  

JOEY:
 ross! can i talk to you for a second?

ROSS:
 oh, uh, can it wait a second joey? i have to tell my parents something. no it cant? okay.   

JOEY:
 okay, look, i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert.

ROSS:
 what?! what is with everybody? its thanksgiving, not...truth-day!

JOEY:
 look, when everyone eats that...that...banana-meat thing, theyre all gonna make fun of her, do you want that?

ROSS:
 okay, okay, well just get everyone to act like they like it. that-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie! 

JOEY:
  

JOEY:
 just kiddin, ill talk to them, you distract rach. 

ROSS:
 hey rach, can i talk to you outside for a second?

RACHEL:
 okay... 

RACHEL:
 whats up, ross?

ROSS:
 so um...thanksgiving. the holiday season is upon us, hm? 

RACHEL:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 and um...you look nice today.

RACHEL:
 oh no. no ross, dont do this.

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 i just- i dont think us getting back together is a good idea.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 i thought this might happen today. ross, i know the holidays can be rough. yknow? and its probably really hard for you to be alone right now.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 no, i-i live with phoebe. i mean youre  alone. and i just-its just not the time for us. im sorry.

ROSS:
  guy for trying!  

JOEY:
 oh and   okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, i learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  and smiling 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. 

JOEY:
 rachel, there you are! come on, lets serve that dessert already!

RACHEL:
 joey, youre gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? you dont get any dessert.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 no, im just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, its trifle time!

PHOEBE:
 so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, isnt it?

RACHEL:
 it sure is.

PHOEBE:
 wow. so then did you make it with beef or eggplant?

RACHEL:
 beef.

PHOEBE:
 i cant have any. you know i dont eat meat.   ohhh no. 

RACHEL:
 alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste.

MONICA:
 really? 

RACHEL:
 oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!

MONICA:
 okay. 

RACHEL:
 op! wait, you dropped a pea. 

RACHEL:
 well?

MONICA:
   mmmm! its good!

RACHEL:
 really? how good? 

MONICA:
 its so good, that i feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it, that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is. especially ross.  

 

CHANDLER:
  im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert. 

  this is, from monicas room.

  

MONICA:
  in the mirror, as i eat it. 

RACHEL:
 okay, now what was that all about? is it-does it not taste good? let me try it. 

ROSS:
 wha? no no! ah!    some left. 

ROSS:
 it tastes like feet!

JOEY:
 i like it.

ROSS:
 are you kidding?

JOEY:
 whats not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? gooooood. 

RACHEL:
 ...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street? 

CHANDLER:
  it, he seemed to enjoy it. 

PHOEBE:
 rachel, come here.   okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack.

RACHEL:
 oh, phoebe, do i wanna hear this?

PHOEBE:
 i dunno, lets see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen. 

 boy, im glad i wore the big belt today.

PHOEBE:
 five minutes ago, a line like that wouldve floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman.  

MONICA:
 ross? lets go.

ROSS:
 oh yeah, about telling mom and dad, i was thinking about maybe writing a letter.

MONICA:
 alright, you know what? thats it. youve had your chance.

ROSS:
 wha-what?

MONICA:
 

 what?!

ROSS:
  dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?

 yes. 

ROSS:
 well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. im sorry.

 it was you?

MONICA:
 and dad, yknow that mailman that you got fired? he didnt steal your playboys! ross did! 

ROSS:
 yeah, well, hurricane gloria didnt break the porch swing, monica did!   

MONICA:
 ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year! 

ROSS:
 monica and chandler are living together!   

MONICA:
 ross married rachel in vegas! and got divorced! again!!!! 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
  wasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle!

JOEY:
 

  thirty seconds! alright joey, if wanna leave, just leave. rachel, no you werent supposed to put beef in the trifle. it did not taste good. phoebe, im sorry, but i think jacques cousteau is dead.  hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.

 and we kinda figured about the porch swing.

 ross, drugs? divorced? again?

 what happened son?

ROSS:
 i-i uh, i got tricked into all those things!

 chandler! youve been rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  monica as well. well, i dont know what to say. youre a wonderful human being. 

CHANDLER:
 thank you!

 no! thank you!  what im gonna do about the two of you!

CHANDLER:
  closing credits 

RACHEL:
 you guys! it was bananas, cream, and beef! i-i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldnt feel bad!

MONICA:
 well actually, i-i didnt eat mine. its still in the bathroom.

JOEY:
 no it isnt, i ate that.

  bedroom.

CHANDLER:
 let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? i remember when people used to use big lights.

RACHEL:
 thats a good story, grandpa. 

ROSS:
 hey

 hey

ROSS:
 wow, monicas letting other people help decorate her tree! did someone get her drunk again or?

MONICA:
 having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about. its about being with the people that you love.

PHOEBE:
 that is nice and were done. tada! 

CHANDLER:
 i dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like christmas to me.

MONICA:
 oh, here. 

CHANDLER:
 see now it feels like christmas! opening credits 

ROSS:
  and thats the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago.

RACHEL:
 so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. 

JOEY:
 hey you guys.

CHANDLER:
 hey joe whats up?

JOEY:
 i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. yknow, everywhere i look shes like 

CHANDLER:
 i can see why thats hard to resist.

JOEY:
 i like her so much!

MONICA:
 aw, im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way.

JOEY:
 i know. and shes so sweet. i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.

CHANDLER:
 you are aware that shes not a monkey, right?

ROSS:
 i am so over janine. i mean, yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now shes like old news! 

 hey guys!

ROSS:
 hi janine!

 i just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for new years eve. its called some sort of dickn rockn dickie eve.

MONICA:
 hold it! are you talking about dick clarks new years rocking eve?

 yeah, thats what i said.

MONICA:
 oh my god! we love that show! i mean ross and i have been watching it since i can remember!

CHANDLER:
 ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you? 

 well im gonna be on it this year. im gonna be one of the party people.

ROSS:
 youre gonna be a party person! those guys rock the most!

 well they said i should bring someone.  dance partner?

JOEY:
 totally! i would love to spend new years with you.

 well actually theyre taping tomorrow. i dont really understand why.

ROSS:
 oh, well you see how it works is, the part with dick clark in times square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. yeah, not a lot of people know that.

 yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?

ROSS:
 are you serious?

MONICA:
 we are there! 

CHANDLER:
 what, what are you laughing at?

RACHEL:
 well, i used to date him, but youre still going out with her! 

 thanks.  run. catch you later! 

 bye!

ROSS:
 bye janine!

JOEY:
 did she just ask me out on a date?

CHANDLER:
 i dont think so.

MONICA:
 what are you talking about? she just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!

RACHEL:
 yeah, but she also invited you and ross. yeah, honey, im sorry, but i dont think that was a romantic thing.

JOEY:
 oh. maybe. but hey i know how i can find out. were going to a new years eve party, right? so at midnight, i can kiss her. and if she kisses me back, great! yknow? but if she says dude, what the hell are you doing? i can say it wasnt me, it was new years!

RACHEL:
 well, thats a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.

ROSS:
 it was a dry day.

MONICA:
 we are going to dick clarks new years rocking eve!

ROSS:
 oh my god!

MONICA:
 oh my god!

CHANDLER:
  

JOEY:
 ok, listen ive been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? its a show, but were just dancing, ok? its no big deal. the important thing to remember  stay cool.

ROSS:
 got it! 

ROSS:
 oh my god its just like i dreamed it!

 ok, everyone gather up. 

 scuse us

 heres whats gonna happen. the musics gonna start, youre gonna dance, were gonna tape, you dont look at the camera. any questions?

ROSS:

 uh, yeah. now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and i want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 okay, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet.

CHANDLER:
 i can save you time ladies, im right here.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, chandler why dont you take a walk? this doesnt concern you.

RACHEL:
 we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.

CHANDLER:
 what? thats terrible!

PHOEBE:
 no-no, we do it every year!

CHANDLER:
 oh well, that makes it not terrible.

PHOEBE:
 no, yeah, we never find them! shes always best at us that wily minx.

RACHEL:
 dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to joeys and search, ok?

CHANDLER:
 no not okay, you cant look for monicas presents!

PHOEBE:
 but we have to!

CHANDLER:
 no, you dont have to, and you cant because i live here too.

PHOEBE:
 well then, you should look with us.

CHANDLER:
 why?

RACHEL:
 chandler, arent you worried about what to get monica for christmas?

CHANDLER:
 no, i have a great idea for a present for her.

PHOEBE:
 oh, thats it? 

RACHEL:
 chandler, thats not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and youve just gotten her one great present? i mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?

CHANDLER:
 if i help, we can find em faster!

RACHEL:
 thats right! 

PHOEBE:
 ooh ooh, we have a live one!

RACHEL:
 oh, its a macys bag! 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, whos it for?

RACHEL:
  presents under the couch? p.s. chandler, i knew theyd break you.

PHOEBE:
 uh-oh. she may be onto us.

RACHEL:
 we are so gonna find them this year.

CHANDLER:
 yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 you dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?

 no, we never do that 

CHANDLER:
 because thats where joey gave me some stuff to store that ive never seen before in my life! okay, that did not just happen!   

MONICA:
 okay, here comes another camera.

ROSS:
 right. no biggie. stay loose.  

ROSS:
 why do they keep doing that?

MONICA:
 if we wanna get on camera, i think we have to get up on one of those platforms. theyve been taping those people up there all day.

ROSS:
 right. 

ROSS:
 hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?

 we learned how to dance.

MONICA:
 oh yeah? well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?

ROSS:
 yeah! 

 hey! youre a good dancer!

JOEY:
 really?

 yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.

JOEY:
 what do you mean?

 like this. 

 thats it, feel the rhythm. thats better.

JOEY:
 uh-huh.

 

JOEY:
 no-no-no-no-no we came together!

 i dont see it.  over there. tall guy, raise your hand! 

JOEY:
 no-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, i really like her and i think i have a shot.

 really, ythink so? i dont..  commercial break   

CHANDLER:
 i couldn't find anything at joey--hey-hey, oh hey!

RACHEL:
 yeah, we found them. there were in the guest room closet behind some coats.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 you took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 phoebe hates pottery barn?!

MONICA:
 yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. she thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.

RACHEL:
 well this has story behind it! i mean they had to ship it all the way from the white plains store.

MONICA:
 its gotta be one of a kind. yknow like umm, yknow uh, whats that god awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?

JOEY:
 hey! i made that for her!

CHANDLER:
 you made pottery?

JOEY:
 yeah! i made it of this fruit bowl i found in the garbage.

MONICA:
 im tellingif you put that in her apartment youll never hear the end of it.

RACHEL:
 okay fine! ill-ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. oh! look at this little drawers! oh look-look it says that it holds 300 cds.

CHANDLER:
 ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore  

CHANDLER:
 so then the farmer says, "thats not a cow and youre not milking it." 

MONICA:
 i am so glad you guys got together, chandler and i are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 how much was it?

RACHEL:
 it was only 500 bucks.

PHOEBE:
 500 bucks at a flea market?!

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 i know you did! i bought the same one! and if she sees your table shes gonna know that i lied to her. i told her ours was an original.

ROSS:
 why did you do that?

RACHEL:
 because she hates pottery barn.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 i know! i know, she says its all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  on, shes gonna be here any second! can we please just cover this up with something?! please?

ROSS:
 what? no! no! i am not gonna hide it from phoebeooh, although i did get some great pottery barn sheets! 

RACHEL:
 ooo! oh, i forgot they made sheets!

ROSS:
 uh, yeah! i still cant believe she hates pottery barn!

RACHEL:
 ross, get over it! its not like she hates you.

ROSS:
 yeah but pottery barn! yknow what i think? its just she-shes weird. yknow its because shes a twin. twins are weird.

RACHEL:
 ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.

ROSS:
 huh. yknow whats not one of a kind? a twin!

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 ugh, i can not believe this! i mean, who is she to judge us? we could not have been nicer to her!

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 thats right! i helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. huh? i helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and i looked like an idiot! and i was humiliated. and i only made 200 dollars!

MONICA:
 we didnt give you any money!  

JOEY:
 you dont think i know that!  

RACHEL:
 see i cant decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the sahara desk, or the parker console table.

ROSS:
 wow! i didnt know that there was a pottery barn up here.

RACHEL:
 i know, i know. i went a little crazy.

ROSS:
 a little? your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. oh look at that! the ornamental bird cage! large!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
  colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 oh it does, it does! it is a room separating apparatus from colonial times.

PHOEBE:
 ah!

ROSS:
 hmm, a lot of this stuff is from colonial times. hey, what are some other time periods rachel? 

RACHEL:
 well theres yore. and uh, yknow, yesteryear.

PHOEBE:
 yeah no, im telling you rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. ross, yknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateand i think that you should. you should, you should ask rachel to help.

RACHEL:
 oh honey he doesnt need my help.

PHOEBE:
 oh, come on! i think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? the cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.

ROSS:
 really?!  sense of what i need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take phoebe down to that colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.

RACHEL:
  think phoebe really wants to come.

PHOEBE:
 no! i do want to!

RACHEL:
 oh, she does want to.

ROSS:
 she does want to.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! 

RACHEL:
 pheebs, i dont know what to say. i guess the flea market was just better last time.

PHOEBE:
 well at least i got these sheets for ross.

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

PHOEBE:
 uck, look at this! pottery barn, yuck!

RACHEL:
 yeah, yknow what? dont look at it.   seriously, dont look at it. 

PHOEBE:
 no! look-look! theres the coffee table they stole from us!

RACHEL:
 ugh, those bastards! lets go.

PHOEBE:
 that fan kinda looks like ours. and the birdcage and thewait a sec! this is our exact living room!

RACHEL:
 no! no! no! no its not! no its not! come on! phoebe, ours is totally different! i mean we dont have the   we dont have thethat lamp! and-and that screen is yknow, on the other side.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god. this is where you got all our stuff, pottery barn! oh my god!

RACHEL:
 okay! okay-okay lookno i did, i just wanted this stuff and i know how you feel about pottery barn. just come on dont be mad.

PHOEBE:
 no-no-no, but i am mad! i am mad! because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! and its all sitting up in my living room and all i can think about is how i dont have that lamp!

RACHEL:
 well then honey, buy the lamp! hey, we have that 60 bucks from ross.

PHOEBE:
 i cant! i cant! unless well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if i didnt buy that lamp?

RACHEL:
 what?! no! im not gonna move out!

PHOEBE:
 but are you saying that you would move out if i didnt buy that lamp?

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay then i dont have a choice! i have to buy that lamp!

RACHEL:
 thats right! 

PHOEBE:
 but at least the apothecary table is real.  

JOEY:
 well, this-this-this was great. didnt everybody have a great time?

 well i did. i really did. and you guys, ive got to say, im sorry if i was a little weird after the last time we went out. i guess i was just nervous or something.

CHANDLER:
 thats totally understandable.

MONICA:
 dont worry about it.

 so we can go out again?

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

JOEY:

 okay. okay. would, would it help if i went over and apologized?

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah! that would be very helpful! yeah.   

MONICA:

 i cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.

JOEY:
 well, when its not right, you know it.

CHANDLER:
 you okay?

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah. ill be all right.

ROSS:
 yknow what would cheer you up?

JOEY:
 what?

ROSS:
 im giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, i think you should come.

ROSS:
 hey, youre not going to believe this. i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy. they printed it!

PHOEBE:
 i didnt know playboy prints jokes.

ROSS:
 yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. its not just about the pictures.

MONICA:
 that didnt work on mom, its not going to work on us.

ROSS:
  one, too. 

CHANDLER:
 that is funny. it was also funny when i made it up.

ROSS:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 i made that joke up.

ROSS:
 uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. i did.

CHANDLER:
 yes, i did. i told it to dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke hed ever heard.

ROSS:
 hey, tell dan, thanks. 

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 im sorry, i was just reading the joke below it. man, that one is funny. 

CHANDLER:
 monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?

MONICA:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 seriously?

MONICA:
 well, you tell a lot of jokes!

ROSS:
 look, chandler, its my joke. but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit, right?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i guess.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
  printed my joke.

ROSS:
 no, its my joke, its mine. you can call them, theyll tell you.

CHANDLER:
 its my joke.

ROSS:
 its my joke.

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa-whoa. jokes? you guys know they have naked chicks in there, right? opening credits 

CHANDLER:
 dude, you have got to turn on behind the music. the band heart is having a really tough time, and i think they may break up.

JOEY:
 lets go watch it at your place.

CHANDLER:
 nah, monicas watching some cooking show. come on, i dont want to miss when they were skinny.

JOEY:
 chandler, chandler, yknow what we should do? you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses.

CHANDLER:
 what? no, i want to watch this.  . did your cable go out?

JOEY:
 no, thats vh-1. i gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . its like a lotta noise to me. i dont know

CHANDLER:
 joey, why is your cable out?

JOEY:
 i uh, oh! because, uh, i havent really paid the bill

CHANDLER:
 if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?

JOEY:
 no, chandler. look, forget about it, okay? look, i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out. oh, was she hot. 

CHANDLER:
 whoa ho.

JOEY:
 i know! yeah, but, look i can handle it. all right? look, i can listen to the radio, huh? and ross gave me this great book 

CHANDLER:
  will let us watch the show at his place?

JOEY:
 sure.

CHANDLER:
  bill?

JOEY:
 not so much.   

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 wh-wh-what are you doing?

RACHEL:
 we are looking at a playboy.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i want to look too!  . yikes!

MONICA:
 so do you think that these picturesare, are they trying to tell a story?

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, where are they, where are they?

MONICA:
 well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah. aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over? 

 yeah.

RACHEL:
 you see, now, i would date this girl. shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, thats got to come in handy

MONICA:
 okay, ive got a question. if you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 me neither.

PHOEBE:
 rachel.

MONICA:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 i dont know.  

JOEY:
 you forget how many great songs heart had.

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard.

CHANDLER:
 so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.

JOEY:
 oh, you guys, with this joke. i gotta say, i know i cracked up, but im not even sure i got it.

ROSS:
 what, you didnt get it? the doctor is a monkey. 

CHANDLER:
 and monkeys cant write out prescriptions. 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 your joke? well, i think the hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.

CHANDLER:
 so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.

ROSS:
 well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer.

CHANDLER:
 well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.

ROSS:
 oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?

CHANDLER:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 well, im not going to go now anyway 

CHANDLER:
 okay  

 

JOEY:
 ah, gunther, i cant pay for this right now because im not working, so ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.

 well, if you want, you can work here.

JOEY:
 uh, i dont know. ya see, its just, see i was a regular on a soap opera yknow? and to go from that to this, i just plus, id have to wait on all my friends.

 okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want.

JOEY:
 what?!

 flexible hours.

JOEY:
 maybe i could be a waiter. could i use the phone? 

MONICA:
  but it was obvious. she picked rachel.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 its wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel.

CHANDLER:
 you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? im going to get a joke journal. yknow? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.

MONICA:
 thats a good idea. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 do you know whats a bad idea?

CHANDLER:
 picking rachel.

MONICA:
 thats right.  something?

CHANDLER:
 maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.

MONICA:
 its coming from the living room.  

JOEY:
   

MONICA:
  

 hey.

MONICA:
  such a cute couple.

RACHEL:
 monica, what are you doing?

MONICA:
  some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.  picked rachel over me? that was funny.

PHOEBE:
 i guess it was kinda funny.

MONICA:
  why didnt you pick me?

PHOEBE:
 fine. the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that youre  just  kinda high maintenanceokay lets go to lunch!

MONICA:
 that is completely untrue. you think im high maintenance? okay, prove it. i want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point!

PHOEBE:
 no, okay, youre right. youre easy-going. youre just not as easy-going as rachel. shes just more flexible and-and mellow. thats all.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 ya, you know, rachel  shell do whatever you want. yknow, you can just walk all over her.

RACHEL:
 what? wait a minute. what are you saying, that im a pushover? im not a pushover.

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay, 

RACHEL:
 oh my  you think im a pushover. well wait, watch this, you know what? youre not invited to lunch. what do you think of that? i think thats pretty strong, thats what i think. come on, monica, lets go to lunch. 

MONICA:
   

RACHEL:
 i cannot believe her.

MONICA:
 i know. where do you wanna go eat?

RACHEL:
 oh, oh, i love that japanese place.

MONICA:
 im sick of japanese. were not going there.

RACHEL:
 all right, wherever you wanna go is cool.

MONICA:
 all right.  

ROSS:
  out. 

 yeah, that-that chandler cracks me up.   

JOEY:
 hey ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause im heading up there.

ROSS:
 uh, yeah, ill take a coffee. thanks, man.

JOEY:
 sure. 

RACHEL:
 no.

MONICA:
 no, thank you.

JOEY:
  heading up there. 

 id love an ice water.

JOEY:
 you got it.

MONICA:
 joey, what are you doing?

JOEY:
 just being friendly.  

RACHEL:
 joey, honey, i dont think youre supposed to go back there.

JOEY:
 nah, its okay. right, gunther?  

 dont wink at me. and put on your apron.

JOEY:
 okay, but i dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. 

MONICA:
 joey, do you work here?

JOEY:
 no.

 hey, waiter.

JOEY:
 yeah? commercial break 

MONICA:
 joey, whats going on. what didnt you tell us you work here?

JOEY:
 its kind of embarrassing, yknow. i mean, i was an actor and now im a waiter. its supposed to go in the other direction.

CHANDLER:
 so is your apron. youre wearing it like a cape.

JOEY:
 i mean, the jobs easy and the moneys good, you know? i guess im going to be hanging out here anyway. i might as well get paid for it, right? i just feel kind of weird serving you guys.

RACHEL:
 come on, joey, i did it and it was fine.

ROSS:
 yeah, why would it be weird? hey, joey, can i get some coffee?

JOEY:
 okay, i guess it doesnt seem that weird.

ROSS:
 seriously, i-i asked you before and you still havent gotten it.

JOEY:
 see, now its weird again.

CHANDLER:
 i think its great that you work here. youre going to make

 dont eat yellow snow. 

15, coffeehouse.

RACHEL:
 well, you know what? this is great. finally, i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too. let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse. first of all, the customer is always right.  way. 

JOEY:
 thanks, rach. look, you guys are just terrific. yknow? now, how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers. its all about turnover.

ROSS:
 joey, seriously, can i get my coffee?

JOEY:
 oh, im sorry, ross. ill get it for you right now. and since i made you wait, ill toss in a free muffin.   

RACHEL:
 phoebe. we would like to talk to you for a second.

PHOEBE:
 okay.

MONICA:
 so, maybe i am a little high maintenance. and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover. but you know what we decided you are?

RACHEL:
 yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, phoebe, are flaky.

MONICA:
 hah!

PHOEBE:
 that true, i am flaky.

RACHEL:
 so, what, youre just, youre just okay with being flaky?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, totally.

MONICA:
 well, then, im okay with being high maintenance.

RACHEL:
 yeah, and i am okay with being a pushover.

PHOEBE:
 thats great. good for you guys.

MONICA:
 i am not high maintenance!

RACHEL:
 i am not a pushover!

PHOEBE:
 who said you were? 

 you did!

PHOEBE:
 oh, im flaky. ill say anything. 

JOEY:
 hey, gunther. can you uh, can you cover for me? i just got an audition.

 no, im leaving to get my hair dyed.

JOEY:
 really?! i like your natural color. come on man, its a great part. look, check it out. im the lead guys best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat. listen-listen. im sorry, that seats saved.

 thats the whole part? 

JOEY:
 okay, maybe hes not his best friend, but 

 okay, ill see you in an hour.

JOEY:
 oh, man, i could totally get that part. im sorry, that seat is taken.

 oh, excuse me.

JOEY:
 no, no, i didnt mean you. but, you believed me, huh?

 i believed you were saving this seat for someone.

JOEY:
 so, youd hire me, right?

 for what?

JOEY:
 exactly! all right, everybody, listen up. the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. 

 huh? what?

JOEY:
 yeah, its for the kids. to keep the kids off drugs. its a very important issue in this months playboy. im sure you all read about it.  

ROSS:
 its my joke.

CHANDLER:
 its my joke. 

 its my joke.

ROSS:
 yknow, i dont think were going to settle this.

CHANDLER:
 lets have monica decide.

ROSS:
 yeah!

CHANDLER:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 hey mon.

CHANDLER:
 mon, get out here!

ROSS:
 monica! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is.

MONICA:
 why do i have to decide?

CHANDLER:
 because youre the only one that can be fair.

ROSS:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 i cant be fair. youre my boyfriend.

ROSS:
 yeah, but im your brother. were family. thats the most important thing in the world.

CHANDLER:
  your only chance to have a baby. okay, lets go.

ROSS:
 well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme. 

MONICA:
 okay, chandler, you go first.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.

MONICA:
 oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas?

CHANDLER:
 can i finish my story?!

MONICA:
 do you want me to pick you?!

ROSS:
 see, i would never snap at you like that. 

MONICA:
 continue.

CHANDLER:
 so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steves doctors name is doctor muppy. so i said, doctor monkey? and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up.  

ROSS:
 are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, im a doctor, and i had a monkey. im doctor monkey!

CHANDLER:
 im not arguing with that.

MONICA:
 all right, ive heard enough. ive made my decision. 

MONICA:
 you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! now let it go! the joke sucks!  

ROSS:
 its your joke.

CHANDLER:
 is not.  and monica can be seen outside, shes lecturing him, and pushes him inside. he then nods to rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then monica 

MONICA:
 hi, chandler. there you are.

CHANDLER:
 hi, oh hi.

MONICA:
 hey, its phoebe and rachel. um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance? 

CHANDLER:
  together lady.  perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit.

RACHEL:
 wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard.

PHOEBE:
 really? ive heard better.

MONICA:
 wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler.

CHANDLER:
  again?

MONICA:
 look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler!

CHANDLER:
  high maintenance.

MONICA:
 ahhh! you are on my list.

CHANDLER:
 im sorry. youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that. and thats good too. so, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because i like  maintaining you.

MONICA:
  that. 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
  be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend.

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
 hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?

JOEY:
 not good, no. i didnt get the part, and i lost my job here, so 

PHOEBE:
 wow! that is a bad audition.

RACHEL:
 how-how did you lose your job here?

JOEY:
 well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. so, i went anyway, and then he fired me.

RACHEL:
 he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youve been working here two days? thats not, thats not right.

JOEY:
 yeah, what are ya gonna do?

RACHEL:
 joey, you cant let him get away with that. ya know what, im not going to let him get away with that. im going to say something to himno, i really shouldnt say anythingno, i should say something to him.   gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him

 okay.

RACHEL:
 what?

 he can have his job back.

RACHEL:
 thats right, he can have his job back. im glad we got that all straightened out. there you go, joey, you got your job back.

JOEY:
 thats great. thanks rach.

RACHEL:
 yeah, pretty nice, huh? now whos a pushover?

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, im sorry.  ending credits  

PHOEBE:
 hey, i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.

MONICA:
 i pick you, phoebe.

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah. definitely you, pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, well, i kinda thought.   

CHANDLER:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hey. oh, i have a question. if-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?

ROSS:
 no way. 

JOEY:
 im not answering that.

JOEY:
 okay rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. ross, double latte, $2.75. chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. and pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. so, all together thats 

CHANDLER:
 this coming from the man who couldnt split our 80 dollar phone bill in half. 

 hi!

JOEY:
 hi!

 how much do i owe you for the muffin and the latte?

JOEY:
 oh thats on the house courtesy of joey tribbiani.

 oh great! well, tell him thanks. and since uh, joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?

JOEY:
 well, hes not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, i good check with himhe says its okay.  bye-bye!

ROSS:
 hey joey, how come our stuff isnt free?

JOEY:
 it will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! this is great! im getting more dates than ever!

RACHEL:
 wait a minute, youre only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?

PHOEBE:
 yeah joey that is so gross!

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
  opening credits 

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
  im sick.

 ohh!

CHANDLER:
 im so sorry youre sick.

MONICA:
 im not sick!! i dont get sick! getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies! 

RACHEL:
 honey, no one thinks youre a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 im gonna grab you some tissue.

MONICA:
 i dont need a tissue! im fine-d! 

ROSS:
 when you put a d at the end of fine youre not fine.

MONICA:
 im fine-d. im fine-d! yknow, its a really hard word to say.  

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 wow! what did he say?

 that he wouldnt pay for my lawyer! then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter hes actually proud off.

RACHEL:
 oh! did you hear that?! my dads proud of me! my dads proud of me.

MONICA:
 rach? 

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, sorry. wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?

 okay, i bought a boat.

MONICA:

 yeah but it wasnt for me, it was for a friend.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 jill, honey, i think this is the best thing that couldve ever happened to you. i mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! and you know when i did it, i-i-i at first i was scared, and look at me now! im the only daughter dad is proud of! okay, well this is, this is what youre gonna do. youre gonna get a job, youre gonna get an apartment, and then ill help you and you can stay with us. right pheebs, she can stay with us?

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:

 we dont give anything away unless its someones birthday.

JOEY:
 well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?

 no!

JOEY:
  

  those bags are so heavy. 

ROSS:

 oh please, i memorized those numbers when i was 15. but look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff i got!  me" sweater.  want to rent me this apartment?" pants. 

ROSS:
 i dont think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.

 oh, mr. scientist has to get all technical!

PHOEBE:

 so who made her queen of the world?

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 i know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids.  

MONICA:
 okay, ill rest. but yknow if im going to bed, then youre coming with me.

CHANDLER:
 that would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippy here. 

MONICA:
  this?  

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i dont you should say that even when youre healthy.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 dont take this personally okay? its just that i just cant have sex with a sick person.

MONICA:
 im with you chandler! i mean i cant have sex with a sick person either, thats disgusting! but im not sick! let me prove it to you. we are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.

CHANDLER:
 thats the thing, see i would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe. 

RACHEL:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 whats up?!

PHOEBE:
 umm, i think theres something you should maybe know.

RACHEL:
 well, itd better not be about the apartment pants, because i just pitched the idea to my boss at ralph lauren and she loved it.

PHOEBE:
 no. no. its just i was umm, i was with ross and jill after you left and umm, im pretty sure i saw a little spark between them.

RACHEL:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah i mean its probably nothing, but i just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.

RACHEL:
 with ross and jill?

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

RACHEL:
 with ross and my sister?

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 with my sister jill and my ex-boyfriend ross?

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 oh there is no way.

PHOEBE:
 okay then.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! i can not believe that! i mean i dont really like it when ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isnt that like incest or something?! oh my god, and theyre gonna have sex! oh! oh no what if he marries her too?! oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. and i cant stop it! i canti dont own ross! yknow? and jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! and oh my god, i cant believe ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. oh my god, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.

PHOEBE:
 but great news about the apartment pants, huh? 

JOEY:
 thatll be $3.85.

 what do you mean? yesterday you said i was too pretty to pay for stuff!

JOEY:
 its just i cant because my manager said i   annie

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think youre gonna go out?

RACHEL:
 i just, phoebe, said yknow thought she saw something between you guys.

 no! i mean hes nice.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

 hes the kind of guy youre friends with, yknow? but hes not the kind of guy you date. hes the kind of guy youd date because you did. me, not so much.

RACHEL:
 oh not-not so much. umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with ross?

 oh no-no-no, hes just i dont know, hes just a little bookish.

RACHEL:
 are-are you saying hes a geek?

 you think so too?

RACHEL:
 no! no i, no ross is not a geek!

 fine, then lets just say hes not my type.

RACHEL:
 what handsome is not your type? smart? kind? good kisser? what those things arent on your list? ross is a great guy! you would be lucky to be with him!

 well okay, if it means that much to you, then ill ask him out.

RACHEL:
 oh no-no-no, no-no-no, thats not what i meant.

 no! yknow what rachel? youre right, yknow he has been really nice to me.

RACHEL:
 yeah but, hes not your type.

 yeah but maybe thats a good thing. yknow im doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe i should try dating a geek too!

RACHEL:
 yeah but, you dont, you dont, you dont want to try to much too fast. yknow? i mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast dont you?

PHOEBE:
  

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!

MONICA:
 chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! i mean you dont have to be so macho all the time.

CHANDLER:
 im not macho.

MONICA:
 yeah youre right. i dont know what i was thinking.

CHANDLER:
 no, i guess i just never really cried. yknow? im not a crying kind of guy.

JOEY:
 come on man theres gotta be something that gets you choked up! like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?

CHANDLER:
 id be sad sure, but i wouldnt cry.

JOEY:
 okay, what if the puppy said, "help me chandler. all the other puppies pick on me."

CHANDLER:
 cry?! i just found a talking puppy, im rich!

MONICA:
 oh, ive got it! i have got it!   pictures from your childhood. this will get you going good! 

PHOEBE:
 all right, whats going on there? 

CHANDLER:
 oh, thats parents day, first grade. thats me with the janitor martin.

MONICA:
 where were your parents?

CHANDLER:
 oh they didnt want to come!

PHOEBE:
 oh chandler!

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 

 no-no, it was! she was in sex toy story 2, lawrence of alabia, and i got her autograph! the guys at the comic book store arent gonna believe this! 

JOEY:
 hey gunther, dont let that guy in here anymore! he just said phoebes a porn star!

 well, i wouldnt call her a star, but shes really good. you should check out inspecther gadget. 

 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey!

 youll never believe what just happened, ross just totally blew me off and he didnt even tell me why!

RACHEL:
 ohhh well. yknow what honey? the best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. oh! there is this great guy you will love at work named bob! hes a real up-and-comer in human resources.

 yknow, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but im not gonna date some random guy from your work.

RACHEL:
 its not random, its bob.

 its probably because not mature enough. or smart enough. maybe he doesnt like the way i dressno that cant be it. its really gotta be the smart thing. oh im so stupid! im just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!

RACHEL:
 no honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why ross canceled the date? because i asked him to.

 you asked him too?!

RACHEL:
 hm-mmm.

 why?!

RACHEL:
 because you are my sister and ross and i have this huge history

 i dont understand, do you want to go out with ross?

RACHEL:
 no.

 you dont want him, but you dont want me to have him?

RACHEL:
 

 ugh! i cannot believe you did this too me! you had me doubting how smart i was! 

RACHEL:
 look, this is not that big of a deal! you just dont date ross! theres a million other guys out there, you just

 hey! you have no right to tell me what to do.

RACHEL:
 im not telling you what to do! i am telling you what not to do!

 why are you so jealous of me?

RACHEL:
 jill this is not about me being jealous of you! this is about you being a brat! wanting what you cant have!

 cant have?! excuse me, the only thing i cant have is dairy! 

RACHEL:
 all right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating bob!

 who?!

RACHEL:
 in human resources!!!!!! 

RACHEL:
 i am jealous of her?! i mean who does she think she is?! princess caroline?!

MONICA:
 youre jealous of princess caroline?

RACHEL:
 do i have my own castle? 

ROSS:
 hey! uh, phoebes not here is she?

RACHEL:
 no.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 uhhh, yeah. yeah. but uh, i dont think its the kind youre gonna like.

CHANDLER:
 you didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you? 

JOEY:
 sort of

MONICA:
 guys, whats going on?

JOEY:
 

 what?!! 

CHANDLER:
 phoebe buffay in buffay: the vampire layer.

RACHEL:
 oh my god!

MONICA:
 thats phoebe! where did you get that?

JOEY:
 well down at the adult video place down on bleaker.

ROSS:
 and-and i, and i saw that joey was about to go in, so i ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then i pretended i didnt know he was in there.  

RACHEL:
 wow! i mean, i justi cant, i cant believe this. yknow, i mean you think you know someone even, even phoebe whos always been somewhat of a question mark.

MONICA:
 this is so bizarre. i guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she had such a terrible childhood.

CHANDLER:
 hey, i had a terrible childhood and i dont do porn.

MONICA:
 yes, but you are dead inside.

JOEY:
 all right well, id better take that back.

MONICA:
 wh-what, why?

JOEY:
 we cant watch that! i mean thats phoebe!

MONICA:
 yeah youre right, we cantwe shouldnt watch this.

RACHEL:
 absolutely not.

MONICA:
  yknow maybe a little bit!

RACHEL:
 probably just the first half.

JOEY:
 no! hey no! this is wrong you guys! phoebes our friend! well, im not gonna watch it!

ROSS:
 yeah! good for you joe!

JOEY:
 yeah.   dressed in leather and carrying a wooden stake. suddenly, the vampire opens his coffin and sits up.

 ah, i thought id find you here, nasforatool.

 buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?

 actually, i was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.  course, since this is network tv, we can only see the reactions of the gang to the film 

MONICA:
 hold on a second! what is that on her ankle?

CHANDLER:
 her ankle is what youre watching?

RACHEL:
 well its hard to tell   oh god, if she would just stop moving.

CHANDLER:
 shes just doing her job!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, its a tattoo! thats weird, phoebe doesnt wait thats ursula! thats not phoebe that is ursula!  

JOEY:
 re! re! then i can watch that! rewind it! rewind it!

PHOEBE:
  doing?!! commercial break  

MONICA:
 hey sweetie!

CHANDLER:
 hey!  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 theres no back to this couch!

MONICA:
 why are you reading this? you hate this kind of stuff.

CHANDLER:
 yeah i know, but i figured a shot yknow? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think i was yknow, all dead inside.

MONICA:
 oh thats so sweet! look chandler i dont care if you cant cry, i love you.

CHANDLER:
 oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.

MONICA:
 stop it!

CHANDLER:
 no, i mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and im like this. 

MONICA:
 i wont care, because i know you will be feeling it all in here. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 yeah! and if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! and-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wont matter to me.

CHANDLER:
 okay, well i wont uh, worry about this anymore then.

MONICA:
 and-and-and if i die, from a long illness. and youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "i will always be with you," and you still cant shed one tiny tear, i know youll be crying a river inside.

CHANDLER:
 aww, i love you so

MONICA:
 what is wrong with you?!!!

CHANDLER:
 what?!

MONICA:
 what?! you cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! now, i left you a note from the beyond!

CHANDLER:
 so you didnt mean any of that?!

MONICA:
 no you robot!!  

ROSS:
 you damn kids! you ring my bell one more time, i swear to   ohh, uh jill. umm, that-thats just a little game i play with the kids down the hall. umm, theyve really taken a liking to me.  whats-whats-whats the matter?

 rachel and i had a really big fight, can i come in? i-i mean i know were not supposed to see each other anymore and im okay with that, its just that i dont know anybody in the city and i really need somebody to talk to about it.

ROSS:
 of course, what happened? 

 

ROSS:
 okay, umm

 but you know what might really cheer me up?

ROSS:
 what?

 seeing some more of your super-cool slides.

ROSS:
 wow! really?!

 totally, i love them! and, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.

ROSS:
 well, id love to! here, you wait right here and ill go get the projector and my notes!

 oh great! thanks ross, youre such a good friend!

ROSS:
 ohh!  quickly checks her makeup. 

RACHEL:
 hey! have you guys seen jill? i cant find her anywhere.

MONICA:
 no, i havent.

RACHEL:
 well, is ross home? maybe ill just call him to see if hes actually seen her.     

 who is it?

PHOEBE:
 its phoebe! phoebe! 

 hey!

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

ROSS:

 oh great! 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
  drapes shut?!

ROSS:
 o-okay, rach calm-calm down, okay? she-shes really upset were just talking.

RACHEL:
 ross! i think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!

ROSS:
 so thats the only reason she could be here huh? it couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe im a good listener and i uh i put on a great slide show!

RACHEL:
 ross, i am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!

ROSS:
 yknow what? i think i can take care of myself, ill talk to you later. good-bye.  whoa! uh, that was your sister actually. she-she thinks that youre just using me.

 so?  

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 oh no, not you too!

PHOEBE:
 no! no! i just went to pick up phoebe buffays checks; there were a lot of them.

JOEY:
 nice!

PHOEBE:
 um-mmm, and i wont have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address.

JOEY:
 thats great, but isnt it gonna bother that people still think youre a porn star?

PHOEBE:
 oh no! no! i know how to handle it.

JOEY:
 you do?

PHOEBE:
 yeah.    where you know me from? all right, ill give you a hint. from porn! okay?   yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!   see?

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 umm, she kissed me.

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 look, i uh, i tried not to kiss her, okay?

RACHEL:
 well, it doesnt sound like it! i mean, its pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just dont kiss them! see look at us, right now, not kissing!

ROSS:
 let me finish, okay? she started kissing me and-and i didnt stop it. i guess i-i just wasnt thinking

RACHEL:
 yeah thats right you werent thinking! yknow what? let me give you something to think about! 

ROSS:
 oh waithold it! but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing.

RACHEL:
 oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisters mouth long enough to tell me that.

ROSS:
 look i-i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us!

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
 no, i mean, look i dont know if anything is going to happen with us, again. ever. but i dont want to know that it-it never could. so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.

MONICA:
 why did they get divorced?

RACHEL:
 well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. isnt that sad?  how different would my life be?

ROSS:
 i know what you mean, ive always wondered how different my life would be if-if id never gotten divorced.

PHOEBE:
 which time?

ROSS:
 the first time! no seriously, imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 id bet id still be doing my kara-tay.   towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical.

CHANDLER:
 maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.

MONICA:
 and what if i was still fat?  dating me, thats for sure.

CHANDLER:
 sure i would!

 

CHANDLER:
 what, you guys really think that im that shallow?

ROSS:
 no, i just think monica was that fat.

JOEY:
 hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives!   oh-hey, theres carol again!

CHANDLER:
 what if i had had the guts to quit my job? id probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my jobs fun too! i mean tomorrow, i-i dont have to wear a tie.

PHOEBE:
 what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch?

ROSS:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 merrill lynch?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i had a massage client who worked there and-and he said i had a knack for stocks.

RACHEL:
 well why didnt you take the job?

PHOEBE:
 because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks, id have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.

ROSS:
 hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, wed still hang out? opening credits

 this is where the opening credits are, but theyre not the usual opening credits. oh no! these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. it then goes on to show rachels still a shop-aholic and with barry. fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones. then theyre dancing in the fountain. joey entering as dr. drake remoray and meeting a groupie. chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get carol into bed. and finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. everything from every other episode doesnt apply, for instance, ross and rachel have no history. and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.} 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 no-no. its-its me, ross!

RACHEL:
 oh, im sorry. ross tillman.

ROSS:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh, its the best!   so, umm hows monica?

ROSS:
 oh really, really great! yeah! a-actually shes right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? you should stop bye and say hi.

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 yeah? oh-oh, shed be so excited!

RACHEL:
 ohh! okay!

ROSS:
 come on! 

RACHEL:
 oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  busty ladies?

ROSS:
 no, its okay. some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but i dont

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 but! dont you have to give him his money back?

ROSS:
 uh-huh.  you go buddy. sorry, no porn for you.   monicas boyfriend is getting up to get something. for future reference, for the rest 

JOEY:

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 hey man, look sorry about that archie thing. do uh, do you need me to give you some money?

CHANDLER:
 hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride.

JOEY:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 ehh.

MONICA:
 maybe joey doesnt have to give you the money, tv stars have assistants right?

JOEY:
 thats an idea!  would-would you take money from her?

MONICA:
 no joey! chandler could be your assistant! see, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!

JOEY:
 thats great! that would be great! lets do that!

CHANDLER:
 i could use the money; it could give me time to write.

JOEY:
 oh right great! welcome aboard!

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 i always thought having a heart attack was natures way of telling you to die!  going to die, but youre not gonna die today. i wish i was dead.

MONICA:

MONICA:
 yeah but see i have nothing to compare it too. so even if youre horrible, how would i know?

CHANDLER:
 i do like that.

MONICA:
 its harder for me! i have those four other women to compete with!

CHANDLER:
 well, if it helps there were only three. so it would just be for tonight, right?

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 hey! there are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! okay? there are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 chandler!

CHANDLER:
 i know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because i make too many jokes and ive never been in a serious relationship and i guess im not technically a "doctor" 

MONICA:
 there was just one woman, wasnt there?

CHANDLER:
 no, there were two.

MONICA:
 including me?

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah. ending credits

 hey, remember when i had a monkey?

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 twenty percent is a pretty generous tip joe.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 i see where youre goin!

ROSS:

ROSS:
 well isnt there something you can do to earn a little extra money? i mean, cant-cant you pick up, i dont know, an extra shift here?

PHOEBE:
 or, yknow, i used to beg for money. of course it helps if youve got yknow a little of this  goin on. wow! i still have it!

ROSS:
 oh, wait! wait! dont you have an audition today? yeah! maybe youll get that job!

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, thats not enough. look, i studying kara-tay for a long time, and theres a concept you should really be familiar with. its what the japanese call   unagi.

RACHEL:
 isnt that a kind of sushi?

ROSS:
 no, its a concept!

PHOEBE:
 yeah it is! it is! its freshwater eel!

ROSS:
 all right, maybe it means that too

RACHEL:
 ohh! i would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!

ROSS:
 yknow what? fine! get attacked! i dont even care! 

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 unagi is a state of total awareness. okay? only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!

PHOEBE:
 you mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? 

ROSS:
  for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, i dont know, like a  

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 and of course, crotchless panties. 

CHANDLER:
 well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  brother,  cant do that we promised wed make each other gifts this year.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 you cant make crotchless panties? you take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 oh, i love paper mache! what did you make?

CHANDLER:
 i made a 

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 im sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but ilook, i just want you guys to be safe.   danger!!!!!  ahhh, huh? unagi.  

JOEY:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i guess i could use that. i could say that your love sends me to the moon.

ROSS:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 ahh, hotties of the paleontology department, theres a big selling calendar, eh?

RACHEL:
 who wrote it?

ROSS:
 oh, i wish i knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.

JOEY:
 oh hey, do you still have their final exams?

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, theres your admirer. 

CHANDLER:
 a hot girls at stake and all of the sudden hes rain man.

RACHEL:
 okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?

ROSS:
 its a girl! anyway, it wouit wouldnt matter. okay? because im a teacher and shes a student.

CHANDLER:
 oh, is that against the rules?

ROSS:
 no, but it is frowned upon.

CHANDLER:
 i see.

ROSS:
 besides, theres a big age difference.

JOEY:
 oh, well think of it like this, when youre 90

ROSS:
 i know when im 90 shell be like 80 and it wont seem like such a big difference.

JOEY:
 no thats not what i was going to say at all. no, what i was going to say is when youre 90 youll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old. opening credits  

JOEY:
 hey chandler! yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, dana keystone. she was in my movement class.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 oh, i dont know man. i havent talked to her in like ten years.

ROSS:
 oh thank you. thanks very much.   ow!  

 uh, im a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation

ROSS:
 that was you? 

 yeah. i felt a little weird about it. youre a teacher. im a student. but would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?

ROSS:
 oh i, i dont-i dont think that would be the best idea. 

 oh, because i was thinking, the semesters over; youre not my teacher anymore.

ROSS:

  an a.

ROSS:

 im kidding!

ROSS:
 oh! so-so seriously, what time?

RACHEL:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 joey! hes working!  that. 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 everythings ruined. my bed. my clothes. look at my favorite blue sweater. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

 well uh, do either of you smoke?

PHOEBE:
 no, not usually. but yeah, i could use one right now.

 no-no-no, do you uh light candles? burn incense?

PHOEBE:
 yes! i do! all the time! i love them! oh my god! i did it! its me! its me! i burned down the house! i burned down the house!

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 chandler, is that  

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 hey-hey listen 

CHANDLER:
 okay! so yeah, maybe we can get together umm  throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and  can you hold for one second please? 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 ah-ha!

MONICA:
 wow! so, now youre going on a date with this girl?

CHANDLER:
 honey, it is not a date! i havent talked to her in ten years! you cant just call up somebody you havent talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. there are rules, yknow? you gotta, you got to put in some time.

MONICA:
 youre right, im sorry. its not like youre yknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend.

CHANDLER:
 no, we only went out once.

MONICA:
 you dated her!

CHANDLER:
 not once!

MONICA:
 all right, well why dont i go out with an ex-boyfriend and do joey a favor?!

JOEY:
 hey, you wanna do joey a favor, maybe you go out with joey.   

CHANDLER:
  business.

 yknow who i ran into from school? howie.

CHANDLER:
 

 apparently howies editing now. yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. can you believe that?! yknow i-i-i havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ive always hated that howie.

 no, no "how you doing?" man, i mean not even a cup of coffee first!

CHANDLER:
 the nerve huh?

 yeah!

CHANDLER:
 refill?  

MONICA:
 now, this is last minute so i want to apologize for the mess. okay?  

RACHEL:
 oh my god! it sure didnt look this way when i lived here.

MONICA:
 i know! now look, theres only one problem though. theres only room for one, so i guess one of you will have to stay at joeys.

PHOEBE:
 well, since the fire was kinda my fault i guess  get to stay here.

RACHEL:
 hey! hey-hey, now this was no ones fault pheebs. okay? it was an accident.

PHOEBE:
 well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.

RACHEL:
 okay! 

MONICA:
 so rach! youre the first guest at hotel monica! umm, youll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. and i thought i would bring them to you, yknow, in bed. oh, you have been through so much.

RACHEL:
 i have. 

JOEY:
 this right here is where i keep the pizza.  uh thats where the napkin is. 

PHOEBE:
 whats that smell?

JOEY:
 i know!  

 oh please! it was such a big class! you never even noticed me!

ROSS:
 what? of course i did! you uh, you sat next to sleepy sleeperson.

 who?

ROSS:
 oh uh, i had trouble remembering everyones name, so i-i kinda came up with nicknames. like the guy on the other side of you was smelly von brownshirt.

 oh yeah. so umm, did you have a nickname for me?

ROSS:
 umm, no. no.

 yes you did! what was it?

ROSS:
 umm, its cutie mcpretty.

 ohh thats so sweet!

ROSS:
 listen, i gotta tell ya, i-im having a great time! yknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank i thought it would be too, but its not. i mean its not at all.

 

ROSS:
  

PHOEBE:
 so did you sleep well last night?

RACHEL:
 i did. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 i did, monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.

PHOEBE:
 yknow what joey left on my pillow?

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 gum!

 well, we determined the cause of the fire.

PHOEBE:
 yeah i know, it was my candle. my candle!

 no, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. its looks like a curling iron.

PHOEBE:
 i dont use a curling iron.

 well someone does. 

RACHEL:
 well, dont look at me! my hairs straight! straight! straight! straight!

 it couldve been a hair straightener.

RACHEL:
 oh. 

JOEY:
 this is where i keep the pizza.  andhey! where did the napkin go?!  commercial break  

MONICA:
 now there you go! i wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!

PHOEBE:
 thanks monica!

MONICA:
 does that smell bother you?

PHOEBE:
 what the smell from joeys? no, i can hardly smell it over here.

MONICA:
 well you let me know if you can, because yknow i can bake a pie to cover it.

PHOEBE:
 i can smell it a little, bake the pie.

MONICA:
 okay!

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 hello?  you. its the fire inspector.

PHOEBE:
 oh!  really?! 

JOEY:
  straightener that started the fire.  was the candles. its very not good leaving candles unattended. in fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  uhh okay. well, i have to go now.   

ROSS:
 we had such a great time! shes-shes incredible! i thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasnt. it wasnt at all. elizabeth is very mature for her age.  

MONICA:
 so its okay to date a student.

ROSS:
 well, not really. i mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. especially by that professor we ran into last night, judgey von holierthanthou.

MONICA:
 well ross, you be careful now. you dont want to get a reputation as yknow professor mcnailshisstudents. 

ROSS:
 yeah. what-what should i do?

JOEY:
 well ross, it seems pretty clear. i mean whats more important? what people think or how you feel, huh? ross, you gotta follow your heart.

MONICA:
 joey that is so sweet. 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey! so, how did it go with dana? any reason i should leave a block of time open say thursday?

CHANDLER:
 i couldnt do it.

JOEY:
 you couldnt do it?!

CHANDLER:
 hey, relax i just need more time. were going to dinner tonight.

MONICA:
 what?! youre going out with her again!

ROSS:
 going out with who?

CHANDLER:
 uh, dana keystone from college.

ROSS:
 oh yeah! wasnt she uh  

CHANDLER:
 no, that was dana caplin. 

 ohhhh! 

MONICA:
 joey! you didnt even know her!

JOEY:
 ah whatever! 

CHANDLER:
 great story again! the yarns that you weave! woo-hoo-hoo!

 yknow uh, actually i-i-i should get going.

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no! stay! stay! because you-you should you-you-you should stay!

 wow. oh, i am really flattered, but i just i dont feel that way about you.

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no, thats notno-no-no!

 im sorry chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and i, i dont want to hurt you. oh, i wish there was something i can do to make you feel better.

CHANDLER:
 no-noreally?!

 of course!

CHANDLER:
 

 ohh, im sorry.

CHANDLER:
 well maybe there is one thing you can do.

 what?! anything! anything! 

CHANDLER:
 well, i umm, i mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but i have this friend. this actor friend and he would kill me if he thought i was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on thursday?

 absolutely! but you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?

CHANDLER:
 well, the heart wants what it wants. ill see you later.   

MONICA:
 hey! hows it goin?

PHOEBE:
 well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.

MONICA:
 yes it has! i made cookies!

PHOEBE:
 oh thats all right. im still full from your homemade potato chips.

MONICA:
 but you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

MONICA:
  in bed, remember? no crumbies!

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 okay! 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 that doesnt lock does it?  

RACHEL:
 oh, joey! sorry!

JOEY:
 no thats all right. dont worry about it.

RACHEL:
 oh but look! thats gonna leave a stain! 

JOEY:
 rach! hey! its fine! youre at joeys!

RACHEL:
 really?

JOEY:
 yeah! look! 

RACHEL:
 ive never lived like this before.

JOEY:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 what do you want to do now? huh? you wanna go get a drink?

 uhh, i cant.

ROSS:
 oh, you have some studying to do?

 no, i have some turning 21 to do.

ROSS:
 yknow i remember when uh, when i was in college, we used to 

 what are you doing?

ROSS:
 nothing, im-im just, im so comfortable with you!

 do you not want to be seen with me?

ROSS:
 what? no! of course, of course i do! are-are they gone?

 uh no, theyre still here but i think im about to leave.

ROSS:
 what?! no! no! wait! youre right, this is stupid. who cares what people think? i mean, i mean we like each other right? theres nothing wrong with that. come on.  burt? lydia? mel? this is elizabeth.

 hi!

 arent you in my popular culture class?

ROSS:
 thats right lydia, elizabeth here is a student and uh, were dating. and you may frown upon that, but were not gonna hide it anymore.

 you are so fired.

ROSS:
 what?

 theyre gonna fire you! you cant date a student! its against the rules.

ROSS:
 really? its not just frowned upon?  

RACHEL:
 i love it at joeys!

JOEY:
 hey, here you go. 

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 thanks!

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 oh, very funny. i dont know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be thursday.  you got me the audition?! lets hug it up! 

CHANDLER:
 okay. okay.  get the part?

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.

PHOEBE:
 now i know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but i think im partly at fault. you see, i didnt, i didnt tell you but umm, but i-i had recently refilled the tissues and so yknow lets just face it, thats just kindling! so i think its better that i stay at joeys.

RACHEL:
 no, no-no-no. phoebe, this was my fault and besides yknow what? im fine here.

PHOEBE:
 okay. oh umm, chandler, monica is looking for you.

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 yeah she said something about crumbies.

CHANDLER:
 no! no! no! i was so careful! 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 no! no! phoebe, come on! i dont want to switch! please come on! i can throw wet paper towels here!

PHOEBE:
 no but at monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!

RACHEL:
 i know. im sorry.

PHOEBE:
 all right fine! this looks like so much fun.  

JOEY:
 yeah. 

PHOEBE:
 god, what a mess.  

ROSS:
 wow! it actually is in the handbook. i cant date you or have a hot plate in my office. i cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.

 for what its worth i did appreciate you standing up for me. it felt really nice. it kinda made me like you even more.

ROSS:
 i know, i know i really like you too. but we-we cant date. its against the rules. its forbidden.

 wow!

ROSS:
 what?

 just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.

ROSS:
 really?

 yeah.

ROSS:
 well i-i-i dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.

ROSS:
  naughty. its taboo.

 oh, were not together.

ROSS:

JOEY:
 hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. ross, seriously, hows it going with her?

ROSS:
 well, actually its been great. shes 20 so shes not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.

MONICA:
 well that is great. and seriously, she seems very nice.

ROSS:
 thanks. i know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. just knowing that you guys are

PHOEBE:
   

MONICA:
 chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. do we have any fruit roll-ups?

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 oh thats so funny because we found someone too.

PHOEBE:
 oh thats good, i guess shell have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.

CHANDLER:
 why would our guy be a weirdo?

PHOEBE:
 cause thats just your taste.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 well my guy is spectacular. okay? hes a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, i looked at it. and i mean all of it.

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

 ross, i think you misunderstood what i was saying. i just wanted to tell you that im going to florida for a couple weeks.

ROSS:
 no. i think you misunderstood what i was saying. what i meant was

 you are so adorable.

ROSS:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? 

ROSS:
 whats-whats the difference?

MONICA:
 well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. spring break youre doing frat guys.

ROSS:
 hey, yknow what? not all spring breaks are like that.

PHOEBE:
 what did you do on yours?

ROSS:
 i went to egypt with my dad.

CHANDLER:
 i can see it now, "look dad, its the sphinx!"  

ROSS:
 hey, i think elizabeth is a little more serious than, "spring break!" 

MONICA:

ROSS:

ROSS:

 oh, dont worry i have plenty of sun block, its spf-30.

ROSS:
 well, if whats in the bottle is actually 30. i mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes its-its get 4, and i swear to god more often than not its just milk.

 ross, its going to be okay. im not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. i really like you. i like how things are going between us.

RACHEL:
  i'm sorry, what?

MONICA:
  what?

ROSS:
  excuse me?

JOEY:
  it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.  

CHANDLER:
  oh, ok.

JOEY:
   "mrs. wallace, i'm dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..."   

JOEY:
  here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.     all you want is a dingle,   what you envy's a schwang,   a thing through which you can tinkle,   or play with, or simply let hang...   and it's also on the soundtrack.  he's joey telling everyone about his big break in

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 no, the little girl creeps me out.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 why would the little girl creep you out?

PHOEBE:
  little slower? 

CHANDLER:
 this is going in your book?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, its about relationships. yknow? the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. this stuff is great!

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh good.

 thanks for your help. 

RACHEL:
 

 just call me paul.

RACHEL:
 paul. umm, i just wanted you to know that ross really is a great guy.

 well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. 

RACHEL:
 you just dont look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.

 well, we were very young when we had her.

RACHEL:
 oh. we?

 well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to  

RACHEL:
 oh no! yes! of course, i know that! i justi meant yknow are you still a we or are you just you?

 im just me, my wife died shortly after lizzie was born.

RACHEL:
 

 yes i did.

RACHEL:
 ohh.   

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 how was your first day?

JOEY:
 pretty great! except i did get a little attitude from the robot.

CHANDLER:
 damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful servants!

JOEY:
 anyway, it wasnt the robot, it was the guy who controls him. yeah, he doesnt like me. he had c.h.e.e.s.e. knock over the sandwich right when i was reaching for one! ohh!

PHOEBE:
 well, why dont you just get him fired?

JOEY:
 i may have to, i hate to do it, but im the star! yknow? theres a limit to how many sandwiches i can eat off the floor.   excuse me. 

  ya!

JOEY:
 wow!

 the thing is its kinda on the q.t. the actor who has the part doesnt know he might be fired. its the lead in a series, mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.

JOEY:
 im the lead in mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.!!

 uh-oh!  

ROSS:
 joey?!

 hi ross.

RACHEL:
 i was just getting him to like you. commercial break 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 okay, ill just wait for him in here!

RACHEL:
 ross, its okay. you can come out.

 yeah ross its okay, its me, mr. stevens.

ROSS:
 

 sure you did! you came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. you were shouting, "joey! joey!" bye rach. 

RACHEL:
 bye!

 ill call you later. bye ross. 

ROSS:
 what-what-what thehow da-how did-what the-how did-what?!

RACHEL:
 well, yknow he lost his keys so he was looking for them

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 no! downstairs! and we got to talking yknow, for like two hours, and i really liked him so i invited him up here for a cup of coffee.

ROSS:
 you were at the coffeehouse!

RACHEL:
 ross, whats the big deal? so i kissed the guy!

ROSS:
 he is my girlfriends father, okay? its-its, its weird!

RACHEL:
 whyou dated my sister!

ROSS:
 that was different!

RACHEL:
 what? why?!

ROSS:
 this is weird for me!

RACHEL:
 ross look, look this is good for you. okay? lets face it, so far the guys not lovin ya! but i can turn that around! i got the inside track! we can all go out to dinner, yknow? and i can talk you up! ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!

ROSS:
 how is that important?

RACHEL:
 oh its important!  

JOEY:
 apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! i didnt know he could get me fired! what am i going to do?

MONICA:
 well yknow joey, youre a pretty charming guy.

JOEY:
 thanks, but i kinda have a problem to deal with here.

MONICA:
 no sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls c.h.e.e.s.e.! youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!

JOEY:
 thats not a bad idea. yeah. okay, but if i got to turn on the charm tomorrow im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.   well, actually i got a little bit saved for you pheebs. 

CHANDLER:
 so do you think uh, joeys more charming than me?

MONICA:
 yeah! thats why im sleeping with him on the side.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, you wish. 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 phoebe, stop writing about us!

PHOEBE:
 im not writing about you! im writing about other people.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so ross selflessly, offered to take me.

 what a nice story!

 so ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.

RACHEL:
 wow! i definitely did not see that one backfiring! im gonna go to the bathroom.

ROSS:
 yeah, take your time.  

ROSS:
  it wasnt as bad as-as

 ross, look, i know ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its partly because im very protective of lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many, many,  youre not 

ROSS:
 not all bad.

 and anyhow, im sorry i was so harsh before, but you have to understand that i 

ROSS:
 yeah. you know what? i know what you mean; i do that too.

 i beg your pardon?

ROSS:
 no! no! noti dont mean i-i see her as a twelve-year-old girl! i mean i-i have a son, whos umm six and i still think of him as a baby.

 you have a son?

ROSS:
 yeah, well my-my ex-wife and i share custody of ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, carol and i are on excellent terms as im sure you are with your wife! 

 dont worry about it, i just didnt realize you were married. 

RACHEL:
 oh we were, but that was just a  that was just a big drunken mistake.

ROSS:
 youre back.

 you two were married?!

RACHEL:
 oh! whoops! im sorry, you were talking about emily!   

MONICA:
 chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.

CHANDLER:
 we said seven!

MONICA:
 we said six!

CHANDLER:
 the only way that i said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.

MONICA:
 yeah and if i had seven, maybe i wouldve said something like this, "wow! my boyfriends such a wise assseven!"

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh my good god.

MONICA:
 ugh!

PHOEBE:
 i know what time you said.

CHANDLER:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 well actually, i know what time chester and marcia said.

MONICA:
 what time?

PHOEBE:
 quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly its my book to the rescue, huh?  things up.

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.

CHANDLER:
 thank you for writing your book. its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.

PHOEBE:
 thanks! so are you.

CHANDLER:
  

PHOEBE:
  chester are planning on seeing a movie on sunday night. marcia thinks theyre supposed to meet at six, chester thinks its at seven.

CHANDLER:
 so you knew we were gonna miss the movie!

PHOEBE:
 thats right.

MONICA:
 inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!

PHOEBE:
  

JOEY:
 i cant believe im going to lose this job!

CHANDLER:
 oh im so sorry man! is there anything i can do?

JOEY:
 yeah! help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard. 

 hey joey, i want to talk to you.

JOEY:
 yeah? well, i dont want to talk to you wayne! i hate you! you ruined my life! oh, chandler, wayne. wayne, chandler. 

CHANDLER:
 hi, how are ya?

 joey, joey, i-i-ill g-get you your job back if you help me out.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 

 i-i-i saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow sarah? 

JOEY:
 yeah?

 i wish i could talk to her.

JOEY:
 what are you in love with her or something?

 yeah. her. all of them. anyone.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ive been there my friend.

 listen, i-i guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.

JOEY:
 oh wow wayne, its not really something you can teach yknow? its pretty much something youre born with if you you-you can teach it! ill show you right how to do it. 

RACHEL:
 i mean if you think about it, i mean ross did learn something from each marriage.

 how to make the next one even shorter?

RACHEL:
 now wait a minute thats not fair. he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily, he just didnt tell me.   maybe i have to pee again. 

 well, this is fun. so ross, did you kill any of these wives?

ROSS:
 yknow what? i-i-i i-i have had enough of this! yknow, i-i-i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect! so if-if youve got a problem with me, frankly

 are you yelling at me?!

ROSS:
 god no!

 yknow what daddy? if you dont like ross, thats fine. it doesnt matter to me, im gonna go out with him anyway.

 really?! 

ROSS:
 well if it doesnt matter to her, it doesnt matter to me!   still not yelling!

 wow. what can i say?  like you any better!

ROSS:
 thats okay, im not so crazy about myself right now either.

 then we agree?

ROSS:
 uh yeah, i guessyeah! i guess so.

 neither of us like ross!

 i like ross.

ROSS:
 ohhh! kids!

RACHEL:
  nice ross is!

ROSS:
 thats okay rach, were not liking ross right now.

RACHEL:
 oh! ive got a lot of those too! ending credits 

JOEY:
 well, it turns out you were right c.h.e.e.s.e.

 the shipment never made it through omaha?

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 whats the matter?

PHOEBE:
 well its justits one of those situations that i just hate. yknow? a massage client gave me three tickets to the helmet-pelts exhibit at the morgan chase museum.

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 no! no! its just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!

CHANDLER:
 ill give up my ticket.

JOEY:
 me too.

PHOEBE:
 okay thats so generous!

CHANDLER:
 and i think ross is generous too.

PHOEBE:
 great! okay then its just us girls! 

 

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 so what-what is the exhibit.

PHOEBE:
 its mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.

JOEY:
 oh man! 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hi!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey ross listen chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!

ROSS:
 thanks? but i have plans; elizabeth and i are going out of town.

MONICA:
 oh thats great!

ROSS:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 i mean think about all the money that youre gonna make!

ROSS:
 why? what?

MONICA:
 well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?

ROSS:
 no, no, thats funny. but maybe its time to move on, let it go, yknow? stop it! besides, rachel is going out with elizabeths father, so ah, hes much older than she is. looks like im not the only one interested in fossils, huh?

RACHEL:
 i mean ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.

ROSS:
 okay, okay. uh, well uh, rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings   being insulted standing right behind the person doing the insulting while the rest of the 

CHANDLER:
 ross.

ROSS:
 oh, come on you guys; thats funny! yknow? because hes needhes got like a hearing aide yknow, cause-cause yknow, cause hes all old, and   then pulls ross aside to have a little chat with him and tells the rest of the group that 

 okay look, ross, just so you know that since lizzie likes you so much, ive decided to accept the fact that youre going out with her.

ROSS:
 really? that okay, thats great.

 yeah. but then i changed my mind. im funny like that. so i told lizzie, now im telling you, i dont want you seeing my daughter anymore.

ROSS:
 all right look, i-i realize it upsets you.

 yes it does.

ROSS:
 but, elizabeth and i are-are both adults and so i dont think theres really anything you can do about it.

 ill call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.

ROSS:
 ohh! a man with a plan! opening credits  

PHOEBE:
 oh, this is so exciting! you get your picture back up on the wall of fame! eek!

JOEY:
 i know. it was so cool when i was up there before. me and jim belushi would just be crackin up about something then i get fired off of days of our lives and he takes me down. now hes just laughing at me. look at him, that smug belushi bastard, ill

PHOEBE:
  next to matt lauer. look at him, smiling at me.  together!  

JOEY:
 hey! so im back.

 who are you?

JOEY:
 joey tribbiani! from the wall!  okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?  huh? okay eh-ah-anyway, im ready to go back up on the wall im the star of a new tv show.

 

JOEY:
 oh well, its not on tv yet.

 well, then its not on the wall yet.

JOEY:
 okay, fine, i will bring you a tape, huh? 

PHOEBE:
 so umm, now do you have any of matt lauers clothes here? maybe? just ones that havent been cleaned yet?   

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh, wait yes, but i cant eat too much. paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.

PHOEBE:
 oh wow. what, do you think maybe hes gonna tell you that hes gay?

RACHEL:
 what?! no! why?!

PHOEBE:
 no reason! that would just be a really big surprise, right? 

  and put the wedding ceremony right over here. 

RACHEL:
 i didnt know you could get married here.

MONICA:
 this would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but i wouldnt put the aisle there and i would never have the ceremony there!  arch. 

 

RACHEL:
 oh sorry didnt mean to interrupt. its just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?

 yes. were very popular. theres a two-year waiting list. sorry! 

RACHEL:
 monica, you should totally put your name down on the list

MONICA:
 what?! are you crazy?! im not getting married! im not even engaged.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but theres a two-year wait. and then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. thats four years. chandlers not gonna wait that long. hes gonna find somebody else, yknow? someone, someone who did put their name on the list. 

RACHEL:
 yeah hon, it cant hurt to put your name down! i mean in if two years if youre not engaged you just dont use it.

MONICA:
 well, i mean i guess there is no harm in putting my name down.

RACHEL:
 im gonna do it too!

PHOEBE:
 me too!

RACHEL:
 really? who would, who would you marry?

PHOEBE:
 i dont know, i dont have anyone right now. yknow?

RACHEL:
 oh pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 dont feel too sorry for me. at least my boyfriend isnt gay.

MONICA:
 phoebe, that stuff is

PHOEBE:
 dont even get me started on yours! 

JOEY:
 

 i did.

JOEY:
 all right, lets get me back up there! 

 no! it dont go up on the wall!

JOEY:

JOEY:
 dry cleaners?

 russians! it showed them as terrorists and villains!

JOEY:
 okay! okay, look! you-you-you got harrison ford up there!

 thats right. mr. ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!

JOEY:
 okay well that may be true. but, in-in okay, air force one the russians were terrorists! and evil! and plus he kills a bunch of them! that-that-thats offensive to russians.

 ive never seen it!

JOEY:
 oh you should, its great.  

ROSS:
 this place is really beautiful!

 yeah, ive been coming here since i was a kid. this used to be my grandmas.

ROSS:
 wow! the only thing i got from my grandmother was her eyes. i mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyesdo-do you want to make out?

 are you okay? whats wrong?

ROSS:
 ehh, i was just, i was just thinking about your father.

 ill just run to the store and get some.

ROSS:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 well for the regular guy, its bad, but chandler, oh dear god!

MONICA:
 i know! i know! and he totally freaked out and i cant find him anywhere!

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

 daddy!

 youre next!!

 okay. i didnt know he was here. 

 let me just see if i got this straight. i tell you to stay away from my daughter or ill have you fired. what you heard was, "take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with rachel!"

ROSS:
 okay, please-please paul, just let me explain

 no, let me explain! fired!!

ROSS:
 all right, fine! fine! have me fired! but uh, i want you to know that you and i are not all that different. i mean, i too am a neat guy. 

 

ROSS:
 and i too am just a love machine.  

 ross, let me show you where the guest room is.  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 im not freaking out. why would i be freaking out? a woman named heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.  

MONICA:
 honey, we were at this beautiful place, and i-i-i just put our names down for fun! i mean, whats the harm in that?

CHANDLER:
 right here! 

MONICA:
 chandler, please dont think i was trying to pressure you. phoebe and rachel

CHANDLER:
 phoebe and rachel! so the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, phoebe and rachel, heldi, and apparently some band called starlight magic 7 who are available by the way!

MONICA:
 it was a mistake. please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that im just not ready

MONICA:
 i know! i know.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 im gonna go tell joey that  really worried about you. 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 totally.

PHOEBE:
 so did heldi show you the place?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, its beautiful.

PHOEBE:
 i cant believe youre gonna ask monica to marry you!

CHANDLER:
 i know.  ending credits 

JOEY:
 hey gunther.

 hey! take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there 

JOEY:
 oh uh, well i just came in for a cup of coffee to go.

 do you still work here?

JOEY:
 no! no, i quit a long time ago.  im sorry.

 oh thats cool, i was gonna fire you anyway.

CHANDLER:
 pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for monica? i cant figure this out! its so hard! should i get her a  tiffany cut or a princess cut or aah-ah! paper cut!

PHOEBE:
 now, have you told anyone else?

CHANDLER:
 no, i dont want to tell anybody else because i dont want monica to find out.

PHOEBE:
 you told me.

CHANDLER:
 well, its because i trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when i was looking at ring brochures.

PHOEBE:
 yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. i only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.

CHANDLER:
 me too. 

JOEY:
 hey. 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey! so chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? 

CHANDLER:
 oh all right.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, coffeehouse.

ROSS:
 oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.

CHANDLER:
 oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place. 

ROSS:
 how rude.

JOEY:
 oh, im sorry. you wanna bite?  opening credits 

PHOEBE:
 so how are things going with paul?

RACHEL:
 good. although yknow, he-hes a private guy. yknow, i wish i could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.

PHOEBE:
 thats easy! you just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.

RACHEL:
 so what are you saying; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?

PHOEBE:
 no thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.

 

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 

 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 hi paul!

 hi phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 so how are things going with you?

 cant complain.  

 

RACHEL:
 okay. 

 

ROSS:
 hi! 

 ross! 

ROSS:
 great to see you!

 good to see you too!

ROSS:
 how you doing?

 good. bye! 

ROSS:
 okay! you take care!   

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and chandler blowing us off before?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! that was so weird, huh?

ROSS:
 phoebe, whyd you do it?

PHOEBE:
 i didnt do it! it was chandler! hes hes mad at you!

ROSS:
 what?! why?!

PHOEBE:
 please, i think you know why.

ROSS:
 i cant think of anything.

PHOEBE:
 come on ross, youre a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.

ROSS:
 wait a minute, is it because joey and i didnt invite him to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago?

PHOEBE:
 do you think thats something that hed be mad at you for?

ROSS:
 i guess it could.

PHOEBE:
 well then i think thats it.

ROSS:
 well, if hes angry, he really shouldnt just cover it up. i-i wish he would just tell me the truth.

PHOEBE:
 oh, if thats what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.  

 honey i made a reservation at china garden, is that okay?

RACHEL:
 yeah thats great. but first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. tell me about your day.

 it was fine.

RACHEL:
 okay. hey, what are you thinking? what are you thinking right now?

 im thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.

RACHEL:
 yeah thats great paul, but yknow i wanna know what know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. yknow they say that still waters run deep and i wanna swim in yours.

 are you talking about having sex?

RACHEL:
 no paul, i dont know anything about you! yknow, like-like your childhood! tell me about your childhood!

 normal.

RACHEL:
 okay, well then how about puberty! come on, thats always a painful time! yknow your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while youre sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.

 nope! that never happened to me!

RACHEL:
 well, youre lucky you never met that bitch sharon majesky. anyway, umm the rest of you life, yknow? any regrets?

 nope.

RACHEL:
 all right paul, im not asking for a lot here. okay? just give me something. anything!

 okay.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 okay.

RACHEL:
 all right.

 when i was six years old.

RACHEL:
 hm-mmm.

 i wanted a big wheel. and instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. it was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. that was a pretty tough year.

RACHEL:
 thats-thats great! see? i already feel like i know you a little better! thank you. okay, come on. now we can go eat. lets go.  

 it was horrible. they called me chicken boy.

RACHEL:
 oh! 

 and in fifth grade i got into a fight. well, it wasnt really a fight. richard darinvel bit me on the nose and, and i feel down. i still have a little scare right here 

RACHEL:
 yeah. yeah, i-i-i see the scare. listen, paul, i think this is really great that-that yknow, you shared your feelings. its really, its beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?

 oh, i couldnt eat now.

RACHEL:
 what?! wait! what are you talking about?! you love their kung pao chicken!

 chicken? 

RACHEL:
 my god, im sorry! im sorry! i didnt mean to do that! i wouldnt do that!  

CHANDLER:
 nothin! this is the nine millionth ring store weve been too and i cant find the perfect ring!   ugly ring! ugly ring! ugly ring!   its a beautiful selection. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, so maybe you dont get her a ring. maybe you-maybe you do something different. yknow? maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, yknow? or an engagement tiara? orooh! an engagement revolutionary war musket!  from the display in the corner.

CHANDLER:
 yknow, im so glad i picked you to help me with this.

PHOEBE:
 huh? can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, im gonna stick with the ring.   oh, this ones nice!  kind sir? can i see this one?

PHOEBE:
  this is the reason you brought me. okay? i know how to haggle. so let me handle this from here on out.

 can i help you?

CHANDLER:
 uh-uh, yes. i would like to see that ring please.

PHOEBE:
 or not, whatever.

 this ring is from the 1920s, its a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.

CHANDLER:
 sir, can i ask you to umm, could youhold out that ring and ask me to marry you?

 okay. 

CHANDLER:
  is it?

PHOEBE:
 chandler, i-i will handle this! 

 8,600.

PHOEBE:
 we will give you $10.

 

CHANDLER:
 yes! yes, but i can only pay $8,000.

 okay, i can let it go at eight.

PHOEBE:
 we stand firm at $10.

 

CHANDLER:
 uh, credit card.  left my credit card with joey. 

PHOEBE:
 okay.  anything her for $10.

 uh yes, i have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.   

PHOEBE:
 ill give you $1 for them. 

ROSS:
 hey, remember how chandler and phoebe blew us off yesterday?

JOEY:
 no.

ROSS:
 remember? you-you were eating pizza.

JOEY:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 okay. well, apparently chandlers angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago.

JOEY:
 oh, were supposed to just get him a ticket?! that guy is always mooching off of us!

ROSS:
 yeah! anyway, i-i still think we should try to patch things up, yknow? like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another knicks game and invite him.

JOEY:
 oh wow thats a great idea! and i still have his credit card.

 

ROSS:
 oh. 

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, i got this one. here you go.   yknow i gotta tell ya, sometimes i justi dont get chandler. yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset.

ROSS:
 all the time?

JOEY:
 all the time! 

RACHEL:
 oh my god! oh my god!!

MONICA:
 still crying?

RACHEL:
 like a little girl. i know. i know. i know. this is all my fault; i wanted him to open up. but god, i didnt know that i was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!

MONICA:
 yknow, i only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. and one of them is sex.

RACHEL:
 whats the other one?

MONICA:
 i dont know, ive never had to use the other one. im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.

RACHEL:
 oh thats right. youre the talker.   anyway uh, great idea! umm, i gotta go to the store; i told him that i would buy him some more tissues.

MONICA:
 oh, we have some

RACHEL:
 no you dont!  

PHOEBE:
 okay umm, id also like to try on the tiara.   oh yeah. okay.  much?

 a tad.

PHOEBE:
 okay. then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.   somethings missing. its not okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.

 

 i just sold it to that gentleman.  

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!!   no! what?! help me! let me out! now!  commercial break

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:
 well, you can see my dad in vegas kissing other dads.

 hey chandler?

CHANDLER:
 yeah?

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 oh hey listen i got us tickets to a knicks game tonight.

CHANDLER:
 oh, i cant go.

JOEY:
 come on! itll be fun! me, you, and ross, and paul probably  

PHOEBE:
 chandler, i found the perfect ring. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but im gonna go with the one i picked first.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god chandler, the one you picked is gone. its over!

CHANDLER:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 some guy bought it. im sorry. i tired to stop it but they   put me in jail!

CHANDLER:
 they put you in jail?

PHOEBE:
 the little jail between the doors!

CHANDLER:
 phoebe, i asked you to guard the ring!

PHOEBE:
 i know, im sorry! but yknow, this ring is better! monica never even saw the other ring.

CHANDLER:
 yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring i got goose bumps.

PHOEBE:
 maybe it was the guy.

CHANDLER:
 it was the ring! 

ROSS:
 hey! so uh, was he excited about the tickets?

JOEY:
 no! he blew us off!

ROSS:
 what?!

JOEY:
 i know!

ROSS:
 i cant believe it.  little mad at him now.

JOEY:
 can i tell you something? me too.

ROSS:
 yknow what? he didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him at all!

JOEY:
 ooooh! freeze him out.

ROSS:
 thats right!

JOEY:
 i like it!

ROSS:
 eh? well show him!

JOEY:
 from now on, its gonna be joey and ross, best friends.   okay! were gonna be the new joey and chandler. 

RACHEL:
 hi. im back.

 hey! i have so much more to tell ya, ive written it all down!

RACHEL:
 ah thats great. no actually thats  thats great! thats really great! yknow, i gotta tell ya writing, i mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.

 wait! wait! listen! listen to this!   yknow what i wanted to be when i was that age?

RACHEL:
 a lover?

 a surfer.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah surfer?

 i wanted to be one with the waves, yknow?

RACHEL:
 okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh,   get a little more comfortable here. wait, now wait a second, this isnt too revealing is it?

  

RACHEL:
 i dont care about the little dude! i cant! i cannot listen to anymore of this! yknow, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! and then its only because they get paid $100 an hour! do you know how much money i couldve made listening to you? $2,000! and do you know when i figured that out? while you were talking!

 what?! i cant believe youre trying to stifle me! when just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!

RACHEL:
 oh im sorry. i i-i dont meani didnt mean to stifle you. i this is all just a little overwhelming.

 oh rachel, im so sorry. i didnt mean to overwhelm you. its just that, when those gates open, you  em. but they are closed now. believe me.

RACHEL:
 im so glad, im so glad you shared.  and im glad that youre done. what do you say we umm  

 i would really like that.  

 that wasso good.   

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 i cant believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!

PHOEBE:
 its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! its a beautiful ring!

CHANDLER:
 no, its not! when i looked at the other ring i could see monicas face when i gave it to her, yknow? and i could see her saying yes. when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring! unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye.  im gonna do in my life. i wanna make sure its perfect.

PHOEBE:
 okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.

CHANDLER:
 i cant do that.

PHOEBE:
 well you certainly cant give her that stupid gumball ring.  

PHOEBE:
 there he is! 

CHANDLER:
 okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.

PHOEBE:
 wow! youre good! after this, we should solve crimes.

CHANDLER:
 yeah! okay, go, go, go get him.

PHOEBE:
 oh, okay.  please? you have a phone call.

 who is it?

PHOEBE:
 it is your office.

 do you know who at my office?

PHOEBE:
 john?

 oh john! great! 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
  the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. so, im gonna need to have that back.  to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. 

PHOEBE:
 wow! i would trade.

 it is beautiful, but im gonna use this one. now, if youll excuse me.

CHANDLER:
 no-no! this is my fiancee  you dont want to break her heart now do you?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, do you want to break a dying womans heart?

 youre dying?! 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, shes dying of a cough apparently.

PHOEBE:
 yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity

CHANDLER:
 

 i dont know. 

CHANDLER:
 great! okay, here. 

 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 i dont know.

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?

 yeah! yeah, sort of. im sorry.

ROSS:
 uh-uhwow! uh, i thought you guys were just like making jokes, i had no idea. what you know what? you guys are wrong. uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but i never notice it. you know why? because she is very mature. besides, it doesnt really matter to me what you guys think. i mean, im the one dating elizabeth, not you!

JOEY:
 thats not what she said last night. 

RACHEL:
 see? now, he could date her. 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 yes! im fine. in fact ive been fine for a long time now and i think, the reason is you.

MONICA:
 ohh thats sweet!

CHANDLER:
 okay umm, before i meant you i had really little life and i couldnt imagine growing old with  lets see; i seem to remember him driving a ferrari in hawaii solving crimes

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 i didnt know it was an auction!

RACHEL:
 wh?!

JOEY:
 i figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!

RACHEL:
 why would a charity give away a free boat?!

JOEY:
 i dont know! charity?

RACHEL:
 ugh!

PHOEBE:
 well, just buy the damn boat!  

RACHEL:
 phoebe, dont you think youve had enough to drink?

PHOEBE:
 im just helping the kids!

RACHEL:
 how is you drinking helping the kids?

PHOEBE:
 because the more i drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.

 

JOEY:
 oh hi!

 your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.

JOEY:
 just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?

 i think it was valued at 19,000

JOEY:
  news. umm, i cant buy the boat, i dont have any money. 

RACHEL:
 joey! joey, good one! 

 thats good. very good!  

JOEY:
 so uh listen, i think im gonna take off now. 

RACHEL:
  buy that boat, all right?! that is a contract! and plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!

JOEY:
 well, what am i gonna do rach?! i dont have that kind of money!

RACHEL:
 i know. okay.  right, this is what were gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then youre just gonna pay the difference.

JOEY:
 okay.

RACHEL:
 okay.

JOEY:
 look, i dont know why the kids need a youth center anyway! yknow? they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine!

RACHEL:
 not great.  

MONICA:
 and so, were hiding in the bathroom.

 and-and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in.

MONICA:
 so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre going at it right on the bathroom floor.

 

 for further reading on the above story, please check out the one where joey moves out.}

CHANDLER:
 i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy. 

 its so great seeing you guys again. id like to make a toast.  friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."

MONICA:
 ohh.

CHANDLER:
 what?!   

ROSS:
 oh my god, you guys!! 

CHANDLER:
  got a story for you! guess who we bumped into at dinner!

ROSS:
 who?

CHANDLER:
 richard!

ROSS:
 what?  right. thats richards favorite place too.

CHANDLER:
 oh you knew that. good!

MONICA:
 i thought you were going out with elizabeth.

ROSS:
 yeah, i was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.

MONICA:
 oh ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just cant get out of!

ROSS:
 yknow, maybe she is too young for me. yknow, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby-sitter. i finally started to see what you guys were talking about. i dont know what to do.

MONICA:
 why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. i mean thats what i did when i first   weighing stuff.

ROSS:
 okay umm, bad stuff. well, im-im 12 years older than she is.

MONICA:
 if the school finds out youre fired.

ROSS:
 hmm.

MONICA:
 shes leaving for three months.

CHANDLER:
 for camp!

ROSS:
 okay, good stuff. umm, well shes-shes sweet and pretty and

MONICA:
 look ross, the only question you need to ask is, "do you see a future?" i mean like do you see yourself marrying her?   oh my god! you did it already! you married her, didnt you?!

ROSS:
 no! no! ididnt do that. its just okay, honestly no. i dont, i dont see a big future with her.

MONICA:
 okay well i thinkthats your answer.

ROSS:
 ive got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part.

CHANDLER:
 hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year!  

JOEY:
 rach! rachel! okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 aw-awww!

 i dont think shed like that.

RACHEL:
 okay, uh-uh imagine this, "the mr. bowmont."

JOEY:
 oooooh

 i dont think so dear.

RACHEL:
 okay look, let me paint you a little picture.   all right, you are settin sail up the hudson! youve got the wind in your h youve always wanted! you get back to nature! you can go fishin! you canooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when youre old, cappy.

 what the hell, its for a good cause! all right!

JOEY:
 no way! its mine!!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 all that stuff you just said? i want that!

RACHEL:
 but joey you dont have $20,000!

JOEY:

JOEY:
 oh my god, youre back!

PHOEBE:
 ohh, let me see it! let me see your hand!  

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 i wanna see whats in your hand. i wanna see the trash. 

JOEY:
 yeah. 

PHOEBE:
 eww! oh, its all dirty. you should throw this out.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 what happened?

CHANDLER:
 richard was there so i couldnt do it!

JOEY:
 what?! noooo 

CHANDLER:
 im gonna do it tomorrow yknow, and-and surprise her, but now youve ruined it!

JOEY:
 we didnt ruin it!

CHANDLER:
 who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands?!

PHOEBE:
 well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor

JOEY:
 glove salesman!

PHOEBE:
 good one! yeah.

CHANDLER:
 this is terrible. what am i going to do?

PHOEBE:
 look, she only suspects something okay? she doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.

CHANDLER:
 thats right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! yeah! convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! convince her that youre a little coward!

CHANDLER:
 i can do that, ive had 30 years of practice.

JOEY:
 hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! 

MONICA:
  keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!

JOEY:
 that guys still doing that?!

RACHEL:
  youre here, let me see your hand!!

PHOEBE:
 no, youre too late!!! she already took out the trash!!!  

ROSS:
  such a grown-up about it! she didnt seem too immature for me! did i just make a huge mistake? 

 

ROSS:
 elizabeth, thank god! i was just thinking about

 you suck!! 

ROSS:
 what?!  

ROSS:
 okay, break-ups still on!  

CHANDLER:
 okay, okay, here she comes!  look? do i look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?

JOEY:
 yeah! and also, a little like a french guy.   i never noticed that before.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 what are you up too?

CHANDLER:
 oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.  yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 well thats a little crazy. although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?

MONICA:
 why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world!

CHANDLER:
 eh

MONICA:
 okay well thats good to know.  

JOEY:
    

 hey monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should i let him in?

MONICA:
 sure, i love this part! 

  

 hi!

MONICA:
 richard!

 actually, im not here to complement the chef.

MONICA:
 ohh oh, thats okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef. like i have nothing better to do! so whats up?

 well, it was great seeing you the other night.

MONICA:
 oh, good to see you too. did you come down here to tell me that?

 no! i came here to tell you something else.  to tell you i still love you. commercial break 

MONICA:
 what uhwhat did youwhat?!

 i still love you. and i know i probably shouldnt even be here telling you this, i mean youre with chandler a guy i really like, and if you say hes straight ill believe you! after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didnt tell ya id regret it for the rest of my life. letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did.

MONICA:
 yknow youre really not supposed to be back here!

 well yeah, im sorry. i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya! i wanna spend my life with you. i wanna marry you. i wanna have kids with you.

MONICA:
 oh god  back here?!

 i know this is crazy but am i too late?

MONICA:
 what the yes youre too late! where was all this three years ago?!

 well i know i was an idiot! and i tried to forget you, i really did! yknow after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to get you out of my head!

MONICA:
 what were you doing in africa?

 working with blind kids.

MONICA:
 ohhh! what are you doing to me?! oh look, i-i im sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.

 okay thats fine, ill walk away. and ill never bother you again, but only if you tell me chandlers willing to give you everything i am.

MONICA:
 well he is! yeah, i mean marriage is all he talks about! my goodness, in fact, im the one thats making him wait!

 you are?

MONICA:
 yeah!

 why?

MONICA:
 why? because of the government. 

RACHEL:
 isnt it incredible?! monica and chandler, gettin married.

PHOEBE:
 i know, theyre gonna be so happy together.

RACHEL:
 ohh i mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?

PHOEBE:
 not that often!

RACHEL:
 no! im so happy for them!

PHOEBE:
 me too! so happy for them!

RACHEL:
 im so happy and not at all jealous.

PHOEBE:
 oh no! no god, definitely not jealous! 

RACHEL:
 i mean im probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. and i mean whats 2%? thats nothing.

PHOEBE:
 totally. im like 90/10.

RACHEL:
 yeah me too. 

JOEY:
 hey uh, have you guys scene chandler?

RACHEL:
  looking for ya, tennille. 

MONICA:
 so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?

CHANDLER:
 sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. lets take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs dont mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!

MONICA:
 yeah, but thats pigs not people!

CHANDLER:
 if marriage worked, id be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.

MONICA:
 wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?

CHANDLER:
 well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.

MONICA:
 oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this?!

CHANDLER:
 whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap?!

MONICA:
 yknow what?! i gotta go! ugh!  

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:
 were gonna find love!

PHOEBE:
 definitely!

RACHEL:
 yeah, im pretty confident about that. thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler! it would be nice to have a little guarantee though.

PHOEBE:
 what do you mean?

RACHEL:
 well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.

PHOEBE:
 you mean a backup?

RACHEL:
 exactly!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, yeah i got that.

RACHEL:
 you do?

PHOEBE:
 hm-mmm.

RACHEL:
 who?

PHOEBE:
 joey.

RACHEL:
 joey?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

RACHEL:
 are you serious?!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i locked him years ago!

RACHEL:
 wh so if neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry joey.

PHOEBE:
 yep, we shook on it. yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.

RACHEL:
 oh, seriously?

PHOEBE:
 ohh, yeah. i think his exact words were  

RACHEL:
 charming.

PHOEBE:
 well hey, its just a backup.

RACHEL:
 yeah.  

JOEY:
 hey monica!

MONICA:
 have you seen rachel? or a mirror?

JOEY:
 this is for my boat, pretty cool huh?

MONICA:
 yeah, its great.

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa, whats the matter?! talk to the captain!

MONICA:
 im just having one of those days where you realize youre in a dead-end relationship!

JOEY:
 chandler giving you a hard time huh?

MONICA:
 its not like i want to get married tomorrow! its just that i-id like to believe that im in a relationship thats actually going somewhere, that im not just wasting my time!

JOEY:
 well, you know chandler.

MONICA:
 no i dont know chandler! not anymore! its like its like somethings changed.

JOEY:
 maybe you changed?

MONICA:
 i didnt change!

JOEY:
 maybe thats the problem.

MONICA:
 what?!

JOEY:
 chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.

MONICA:
 is that some kind of boat talk?

JOEY:
 i dont know!  talk on my boat yet.

MONICA:
 what does he think? does he think im just gonna wait around for nothing?

JOEY:
 monica face it, chandler is against marriage. and-and always will be!

MONICA:
  me.

JOEY:
 there are?

MONICA:
 yeah! richard!

JOEY:
 r-r-richard said he wants to marry you?!  chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!

MONICA:
 thats right.

JOEY:
 chandler loves marriage!!

MONICA:
 you just told me that he hates marriage! that-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! that-that hes against marriage and always will be!

JOEY:
 you got that from what i said?!   

 when the cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.

ROSS:
 what happened you guys? 

ROSS:
 rach!

RACHEL:
 hey you!

ROSS:
 hey, come on in.

RACHEL:
 oh thank you. hey yknow, im so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth.

ROSS:
 oh, thanks. yeah, i really thought wed be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just wasnt meant to be.

RACHEL:
 yeah, love. its a tricky business isnt it?

ROSS:
 i guess so.

RACHEL:
 so what do you say we make a pact? if you and i are both single by the time were 40, we get married. i mean, we know each other, we like each other, and weve-weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprises there! you know what i mean? no like, "whats that?!"

ROSS:
 right. ohh! you-you want me to be your backup.

RACHEL:
 exactly.

ROSS:
 ohh, yeah i already have one.

RACHEL:
 what? who?

ROSS:
 phoebe.

RACHEL:
 phoebe?! wait abut-but she just, she said that joey was her backup.

ROSS:
 ohh, i dont think so.

RACHEL:
 ross! i just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and joey made a deal!

ROSS:
 thats impossible! i mean we have had a deal for years! we-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.  

JOEY:
 where the hell have you been?!

CHANDLER:
 i was making a coconut phone with the professor.

JOEY:
 richard told monica he wants to marry her!

CHANDLER:
 what?!

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah, ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these  flying off!

CHANDLER:
 myoh my god!

JOEY:
 i know! they suck!!

CHANDLER:
 hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! im supposed to do that!

JOEY:
 i know!

CHANDLER:
 well what yknow what im gonna do? im gonna go over there; im gonna kick his ass! 

JOEY:
 look, chandler i dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. okay? just go and find monica!

CHANDLER:
 youre right.

JOEY:
 yeah!

CHANDLER:
 okay.  im gonna get the ring!   im just going to propose!

JOEY:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 okay great.

JOEY:
 dude-dude-dude!

CHANDLER:
 what?!

JOEY:
 let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat. commercial break  

MONICA:
 hi.

 hi.

MONICA:
 i dont know why im here.

 i didnt ask. you wanna come in?

MONICA:
 i dont know.

 oh, okay. well, ill just leave the door open and go sit on the couch. 

MONICA:
 

 

MONICA:
 yeah, ill have a scotch

 on the rocks with a twist? i remember. 

MONICA:
 

 uh, no! no! thatsart! if it bothers you i can put my art out.

MONICA:
 no thats, thats okay.

 so monica let me ask you a question. yknow, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?

MONICA:
 uh yeah, i-i actually i thought about you a couple months ago.

MONICA:
 edward nevski?

 yeah hes no good. do you ever  non-eye doctor way?

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 phoebe! you picked joey and ross?! you can not have two backups!

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 phoebe! were both 

ROSS:
 phoebe, how could you do this to me?!

PHOEBE:
 i dontlook i dont know what youre complaining about now? you were both aware of the situation! 

JOEY:
 no we werent!

ROSS:
 i was not!

PHOEBE:
 okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when were married!

RACHEL:
 phoebe you cant have both of them! you have to pick one!

JOEY:
 pick me!!

ROSS:
 no! pick me! i dont want to end up an old maid!

PHOEBE:
 all right well lets see, ross is a good father, but joey has a boatthis is hard!

JOEY:
 this is crazy! hey look, i wanna switch to rachel!

ROSS:
 ooh, i wanna switch to rachel too! 

PHOEBE:
 no wait! justokayjust wait! you guys! wait you guys! dont make any rash decisions, okay? just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.

RACHEL:
 oh god, phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 oh.   mouths, "no, im not." both joey and ross smile, look at each other, and 

RACHEL:
 okay, yknow what?! i know-i know how to settle this! all right here, this is what were gonna do! im gonna write joey on one napkin  and im gonna right ross on the other napkin  and that person is going to be our backup! okay?

JOEY:
 okay thats fair.

ROSS:
 all right.

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 

 excuse me?

MONICA:
 oh! 

 oh. 

MONICA:
 i missed this apartment! now, this is a grown-ups apartment! yknow, i-i should be with a grown-up, do you know what i mean?!

 yeah! youre saying, you need to be with someone more mature. maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. or a mustache.

MONICA:
 yknow, lets face it, im not a kid anymore! i-i need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that i do! i mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, i want that! talking about pig sex over lunch, i dont want that!

 i think thats fair.

MONICA:
 fair? please dont even talk to me about fair! fair wouldve been you wanting to marry me back then! or fair wouldve been chandler wanting to marry me now! believe me, nothing about this is fair! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing!

 its okay! shh! hey. hey. 

MONICA:
 nothing.   i dont knumm. i dont know. umm

 i know. 

MONICA:
 yknow, i-i i have to figuresome styknow, some stuff before i can

 yeah, i understand. take as much time as you want.  twenty minutes if you need it. ill be here. not smoking.   

 chandler.

CHANDLER:
 where is she? im not scared of you!  

 shes not here and please come in.

CHANDLER:
  coaster? ha-ha, monica! monica!

 okay, she was here, but she left.

CHANDLER:
 well where did she go?

 well she said she had to think things over.

CHANDLER:
 oh my god, i cant believe this! yknow, i thoughti thought you were a good guy.

 oh, hey look nothing happened.

CHANDLER:
 nothing happened? nothing? so you didnt tell my girlfriend that you love her?

 well all right, one thing happened?

CHANDLER:
 yknow what? i cant believe this! do you know what you did? my girlfriend is out there thinking things over! you made my girlfriend think!!

 well im sorry.

CHANDLER:
 and what does she have to think about? i love her!

 well, apparently im willing to offer her things that you are not.

CHANDLER:
 but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, yknow? a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things, shed be surprised!

 well if it helps, it worked very well.

CHANDLER:
 it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this isnt fair. you had your chance with her! you had your chance and you blew it! and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! and this is all just been one stupid mistake!  propose tonight.

 you were gonna propose? 

CHANDLER:
 yeah i even  you get a ring?

 no i dont have a ring!  and can i give you a piece of advice? if you do get her, dont let her go. trust me.

CHANDLER:
 yknow richardyou are a good guy.

 i know.     

JOEY:
 dude!

CHANDLER:
 i cant talk to you now, i gotta find monica!

JOEY:
 shes gone.

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 shes gone. she had a bag and she left.

CHANDLER:
 what are you talking about?

JOEY:
 she was all crying. she-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.

CHANDLER:
 well why didnt you stop her?! why didnt you just tell her it was a plan?!

JOEY:
 i-i did! i told her everything, chandler! but she wouldnt believe me.

CHANDLER:
 well where where did she go?

JOEY:
 to her parents i think and she said you shouldnt call her. but if i were you i would.

CHANDLER:
 i cant believe i ruined this.

JOEY:
 i am so sorry man.  

MONICA:
 you wanted it to be a surprise. 

CHANDLER:
 oh my god. 

MONICA:
 chandler in all my life i never thought i would be so lucky.  reason why girls dont do this!

CHANDLER:
 okay!   mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you,   and if youll let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. 

MONICA:
 yes.  

MONICA:
 i knew you were likely to take a wife!

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:

JOEY:
 but i-i-i cant stay too long, i gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and i gotta look good. im supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. 

CHANDLER:
 so when you said, "get up early," did you mean 1986?

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 one night, just-just sex. no strings attached?

RACHEL:
 yeah-yeah, we never had that,

ROSS:
 no. 

ROSS:
 okay, this is getting a little crazy. i mean, im-im sure it would be amazing but igotta say i really-really dont think it would be a good idea. yknow? i really, reallydont.  to be exact  room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. hes got the wool cap, hes got the cut-off knicks jersey over the faded t-shirt, and hes got the whole pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like theyre from 

JOEY:
 sup? sup dude?

CHANDLER:
  hurt me.

JOEY:
 so youre playing a little playstation, huh? thats whack! playstation is whack! sup with the whack playstation, sup?! huh? come on, am i 19 or what?!

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 come on man, really how old?!

CHANDLER:
 young! youre a man-child okay?! now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!

JOEY:
 wow thanks! 

CHANDLER:
 joe?

JOEY:
 yeah!

CHANDLER:
 uhh, youve had a lot of sex right?

JOEY:
 when? today? some, not a lot.

CHANDLER:
 well, its just the reason that im asking is because i kind of eh, uh, i was unable toi mean i really wanted too, but i couldnt. there huhhmm, there-there was an incident.

JOEY:
 dont worry about that man, that happens.

CHANDLER:
 its happened to you?

JOEY:
 yeah! once.

CHANDLER:
 well, whatd you do?

JOEY:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 see, ive been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people im only planning on doing this once. so, uh yknow, maybe this is selfish and im sorry about it, but i was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.

RACHEL:
 oh honey, but it is just about

ROSS:
 it is! it is!

MONICA:
 no its not! no! no! now its about you and ross getting back together!

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 you guys kissed! oh mythis is huge!

RACHEL:
 no!

ROSS:
 oh no!

RACHEL:
 no-no, its really not huge.

ROSS:
 and; people thinking its huge has led monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. 

MONICA:
 well, were still talking about it, arent we?

PHOEBE:
 well yeah, that and chandlers problem.

JOEY:
 monica-monica-monica-monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about ross and rachel.

MONICA:
 yes that would be lovely.

JOEY:
 you got it. okay. now, i can pass for 19 right?!

CHANDLER:
 yes, you can pass for 19.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 yes!

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay, so the plaza! okay, well get us some mai thais, 

MONICA:
 yknow what? i-i think that umm, i dont feel like going to the plaza.

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 honey, monica, this is ridiculous! look

MONICA:
 no-no, i-i really dont want to talk about it! i dont!   especially with you. 

JOEY:
 psss, that is whack! 

PHOEBE:
  ill play it at the wedding.

JOEY:
 yeah! well, i think well see if they actually let you play. huh? i mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "you look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "no you dont."

PHOEBE:
 well, i dont think monica is gonna take this away.

JOEY:
 wouldnt she?

PHOEBE:
 would she?

JOEY:
 would she?  ate my candy bar!  

ROSS:
 guess who? 

RACHEL:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey, i just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air

RACHEL:
 what do you think monica mean when she said she didnt want to talk, especially with me? i mean, why not especially you and me? we were both out there kissing.

ROSS:
 still thinking about it huh?

RACHEL:
 come on! serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 i care!

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 yknow what, i-i have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?

ROSS:
 okay. sure. 

RACHEL:
 am i going to let you watch me undress?

ROSS:
  

MONICA:
 i cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.

CHANDLER:
 now monica, i know youre upset, but dont forget. there is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in paris.

MONICA:
 paris?

CHANDLER:
 we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la 

MONICA:
 keep talking.

CHANDLER:
 then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because its romantic, but because i can!

MONICA:
 i love you! 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away. 

CHANDLER:
 its paris, who knows were here!

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay, you said i could sing at your wedding so, im just gonna need a small deposit.

MONICA:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.

CHANDLER:
 pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i see.  

JOEY:
 they break your heart, dont they?

PHOEBE:
 yknow, i dont really their permission.

JOEY:
 yeah! if you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!

PHOEBE:
 yeah! and if you wanna look 19, then you you gotta do something about your eyes.

JOEY:
 what?! whats wrong with my eyes.

PHOEBE:
 they give you away! theres just-theres just too much wisdom in there. 

JOEY:
 and thatll get rid of my wisdom?

PHOEBE:
 maybe just 10 minutes for you.  

CHANDLER:
 oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i dont care! 

MONICA:
 yes.

RACHEL:
 monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me?

CHANDLER:
 what a great apology! 

RACHEL:
 no-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?

MONICA:
 well, lets just say its not the first time youve stolen my thunder.

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 monica, what are you talking about?

MONICA:
 my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin charlie.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 its all everybody at the party could talk about!

RACHEL:
 monica, yknow what? the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring!

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 oh!! 

PHOEBE:
    "whenever i get married, guess who wont get to sing?     somebody named geller! and somebody else named bing!"   

RACHEL:
 monica, your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago.

MONICA:
 and yet, here we are doing it again.

RACHEL:
 ugh, monica i dont want to steal your stupid thunder!

MONICA:
 oh please! why else would you have made out with ross?!

ROSS:
 got me. 

RACHEL:
 all right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it aint gonna happen!

MONICA:
 i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night!

RACHEL:
 i swear, i never wanted any part of your night!

MONICA:
 oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!

ROSS:
 uh, rachel, ive been thinking. i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. im calling it off.

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
  your night?

MONICA:
 i dont know! i dontmaybe youre feeling a little resentful. maybe ah, maybe you thought youd get married first! maybe you cant stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!

RACHEL:
 oh wow. thatyknow what? that is so unfair. yknow what? now i want to steal your thunder! come on ross, lets go have sex!  

MONICA:
  my engagement night!!

CHANDLER:
 well, somebody should.  

ROSS:
 look uh, if were gonna do this

RACHEL:
 were not gonna do this, all right? shes just gonna think that were doin it.

ROSS:
 oh, i see, so everybody wins.  

RACHEL:
 who is it?

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 okay well ross! stop it please! wait a minute!  

ROSS:
 oww!

RACHEL:
 yeah, you like that baby?  we help you?

MONICA:
 i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together, but i must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement im going to announce that im pregnant!

CHANDLER:
 how is that ever going to happen?!

RACHEL:
 all right monica, do you want to know why i was with ross tonight?!

MONICA:
 i know why!

RACHEL:
 no you dont know why!

MONICA:
 okay! why?!

RACHEL:
 because! because i was sad.

MONICA:
 what do you mean?

RACHEL:
 look, i am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that im not. im not even close. and i dont know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that thats dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 anyway sweetie, i am, im so sorry i ruined your night.

MONICA:
  

ROSS:
  man.

CHANDLER:
 thanks.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 what can i say, you missed your chance. from now on the only person whos going to enjoy these bad boys    ending credits  

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 yeah, so lets get started on the wedding plans!

MONICA:
 okay! 

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah, we got a lot to do! we gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music

CHANDLER:
 oh, i got some thoughts on that.

RACHEL:
 oh wait chandler, too many cooks

ROSS:
 take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 what in gods name is that?!

ROSS:
 oh my god, the wedding book?! i havent seen that since the forth grade!

MONICA:
 this baby has got everything. take yknow, locations for instance.  geographically, then by square footage. 

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 oh my god! of course, of course.  excuse me for a moment? umm, do you know each others hometowns? why dont you  wh-whats going on?

PHOEBE:
 well, umm, not much. but, i was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? so, could i just move in with you for a couple days?

ROSS:
 umm, okay, yeah, sure. but wh-whats wrong with monica and chandler?

PHOEBE:
 nothingwhy?!

ROSS:
 phoebe, you said it was urgent!

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah it is! im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.

ROSS:
 do you realize i have a classroom full of students?

PHOEBE:
  to come to the movies?  

MONICA:
 all right, so i havent cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.

RACHEL:
 okay.

MONICA:
 all right umm, a string quartet for the procession.

RACHEL:
 aw.

MONICA:
 a jazz trio for cocktails. the bay city rollers for dancing. wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.

CHANDLER:
 well, you couldnt get them anyway. ian doesnt plan anymore and derrick  shouldnt know.

JOEY:
   yknow, something a little snugglyer?

CHANDLER:
 why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?

JOEY:
 well, the duck

RACHEL:
 what?! the duck?! what the hell did the damn duck do now?!

JOEY:
 uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!

CHANDLER:
 now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?

MONICA:
 of course you can look at it! yeah, i want your opinion too!

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 here you go! what do you think about centerpieces?

CHANDLER:
 centerpieces!

MONICA:
 yeah! roses or lilies? 

CHANDLER:
 definitely roses.  think theyre a little more weddingy.  but lilies are the clear choice.

MONICA:
 oh my god! its like one mind.

CHANDLER:
 uh-huh!

JOEY:
  gonna get cranky!

RACHEL:
 joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!

JOEY:
 yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!

RACHEL:
 what?!

JOEY:
 all right, im gonna go! 

RACHEL:
 now joey, what did the duck do?!

JOEY:
 i dont know! but he did not eat your face cream!  

JOEY:
 hey little buddy, how are you feeling?   what the hell is in that face cream?   thats so soft.  pillowcases!     the vicar?  for hours. her loins were burning. she threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his dirty book!   table shes set up in the living room. ross enters and is shocked to see a naked man 

ROSS:
 uh, phoebe

PHOEBE:
 oh ross, hi.

ROSS:
 phoebe, what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
 im sorry, im with a client right now.

ROSS:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 okay, lets talk outside. 

ROSS:
 phoebe, you cant massage people in my apartment!

PHOEBE:
 whats the big deal? i did it at monica and chandlers!

ROSS:
 and they knew about it?

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 look, this is my home and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want!

PHOEBE:
 okay, i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. i just dont know what the big deal is!

ROSS:
 the big deal is i dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when i want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! cold beer. 

RACHEL:
 hey joey, what cha doing?

JOEY:
 sweepin. why? turn you on?

RACHEL:
 no.

JOEY:
 huh. what if i was sweeping a chimney?

RACHEL:
 joey, did you my face cream? 

JOEY:
 where are you going? the vicar wont be home for hours. 

RACHEL:
 joey, 

JOEY:
 where do you think, 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 yeah i did!

RACHEL:
 joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!

JOEY:
 okay, look im sorry, i went in there to take a nap and i know i shouldnt have, but you got porn!

RACHEL:
 hey-hey, yknow what? i dont care! im not ashamed of my book. theres nothing with a woman enjoying a littleerotica. its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.  

JOEY:
 you got porn!  a puzzlebeer! cold beer. and he decides to fold up phoebes massage table, but being ross has trouble with it as there is a knock on the door. he sets the table back up 

ROSS:
 hello.

 hi, is uh phoebe here?

ROSS:
 uh no-no, she-shes out for the night.

 ohh great.

ROSS:
 can i, can i help you with something?

 well, i dont know. are you a masseur?

ROSS:
 

 great!  much, ill be back to pick him up in an hour.   

 so chandler, youre parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, i should probably call them.

 i remember when we first got engaged.

CHANDLER:
 oh, i dont think i ever heard that story.

MONICA:
 oh dad, really you dont need to

  dont know that happened.

  thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!

CHANDLER:
 what a sweet story.

MONICA:
 well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party.

 what?! they wanted a scary story!

MONICA:
 anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well i guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund. 

 you tell her jack, i cant do it.

MONICA:
 what happened? you still have the monica wedding fund dont you?

 we have it. only now, we call it the beach house. commercial break 

MONICA:
 i dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!

 were sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself.

MONICA:
 you bought the beach house when i was 23!

 which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie.

 we really do feel bad about this though.

 we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.

MONICA:
 what about when i started dating chandler?

 well it was chandler! we didnt think hed ever propose!

CHANDLER:
 clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. 

MONICA:
 i cant believe it! that there is no money for my wedding?!

 we might still have some money, if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet.

 it seemed like such a simple idea.

 stupid jack, the word is stupid.

 all right, enough! i dont want to hear about it anymore!   

ROSS:
 okay! now, im going to touch you.  thats soft.    

MONICA:
 i cant believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it?

CHANDLER:
 i dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. shes saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to 

RACHEL:
 well what happened at dinner?

MONICA:
 my parents spent the money for our wedding!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 wait, but theres no money! well this is terrible! you guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!

CHANDLER:
 honey, its gonna be okay.

MONICA:
 no! no its not! its not gonna be okay! it sucks! no swing band! no lilies!

RACHEL:
 no, yknow what? its gonna be okay. i mean you dont have to have this rustic italian feast. yknow? and-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. 

CHANDLER:
 look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.

RACHEL:
 do you even understand what off the rack means?!

PHOEBE:
 look, why dont you just pay for it yourself?

MONICA:
 how? i dont have any money.

CHANDLER:
 well, i have some.

MONICA:
 how much?

CHANDLER:
 well, close to   

MONICA:
 whoa!!! are you kidding me?!

RACHEL:
 well what?! how-how much is it?!

MONICA:
 its enough for wedding scenario eight.

RACHEL:
 ohh! 

MONICA:
  amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding? 

 ah, yeah!

CHANDLER:
 well, come on, ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.

PHOEBE:
  chandler.

MONICA:
 this is the most special day of our lives.

CHANDLER:
 no, i realize that honey, but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party.

MONICA:
 honey, umm i-i love you,  party one more time, you may not get invited. okay?  earn more money, okay? but uh, were only gonna get married once.

CHANDLER:
 look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no.

MONICA:
 you-youre gonna have to put your foot down?

CHANDLER:
 yes, i am!

PHOEBE:
 wow, money and a firm hand. finally a chandler i can get on board with.  

JOEY:
 hey rach.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hey rach, do you smell smoke?

RACHEL:
 uh-huh, i get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.

JOEY:
 no-no-no, im serious. you dont smell it? somethings on fire.

RACHEL:
 well no, i dont smell anything.

JOEY:
 oh, yknow what? its probably just your burnin loins.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 nothing!

ROSS:
  heat this up on your loins? 

RACHEL:
 yknow, i can not believe you told him, joey!

ROSS:
 so i guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?

RACHEL:
 uh-huh, yeah i did, because i wore out my first copy when i was with you. 

ROSS:
  of porno magazines! 

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 my massage client, arthur? his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 he said you poked at him with wooden spoons.

ROSS:
 okay, so it wasnt uh, a traditional massage. but i did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. and, and i gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.

PHOEBE:
 well, hes never coming back! okay? you just cost me eight dollars a week!

ROSS:
 hey, yknow what? this is your fault! youre the one that didnt move his-his appointment.

PHOEBE:
 oh, its my fault?! you didnt have to massage him! you couldve sent him away! you couldve not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back!

ROSS:
 he said he liked that!! oh youre right, youre right. im sorry.

JOEY:
 dude, what are you massaging an old man for?

ROSS:
 his daughter was hot.

JOEY:
 gotcha.  

MONICA:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey.

MONICA:
 listen umm, ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that.

CHANDLER:
 ehh.

MONICA:
 eh, you work for that.

CHANDLER:
 look, i thought about it too, and im sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.

MONICA:
 you do?!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, im putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.

MONICA:
 oh, youre so sweet.  our, what about the future and stuff?

CHANDLER:
 eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, yknow? well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.

MONICA:
 you thought about that?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 how many kids were we gonna have?

CHANDLER:
 uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.

MONICA:
 what else did you think about?

CHANDLER:
 well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 sure you do.

MONICA:
 no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage.

CHANDLER:
 you sure?

MONICA:
 uh-hmm.

CHANDLER:
 i love you so much.

MONICA:
 i love you.  talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, totally!

MONICA:
 oh good. ending credits

JOEY:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 thats okay pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so you dont have to get us

MONICA:
  want to deprive them of that joy.

RACHEL:
 oh, yknow what you should get em? one of those little uh, portable cd players.

MONICA:
 oh, i already have one. 

PHOEBE:
 not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.

RACHEL:
 yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means joey.

MONICA:
 hey, i know i what i want!

CHANDLER:
 what we want honey.

MONICA:
 no, you dont want this. i want to have your grandmothers cookie recipe.

PHOEBE:
 you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?

MONICA:
 uh-huh, yeah.

PHOEBE:
 you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that i would never let out of our family?

CHANDLER:
 dying people say the craziest things.

MONICA:
 i wanted it for years! i was gonna make cookies for my children.

PHOEBE:
 break my heartoh, all right.

MONICA:
 okay. im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies.

CHANDLER:
 our kids are gonna be fat arent they.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey! hows the boat?!

JOEY:
 great! im finally getting into this sailing stuff.

MONICA:
 oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?

JOEY:
 why would i do that? it took three guys to get the thing in there!

PHOEBE:
 if you dont sail your boat, what do you do on it?

JOEY:
 oh, its great! its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.  

CHANDLER:
 well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.

RACHEL:
 yknow joey, i could teach you to sail if you want.

JOEY:
 you could?

RACHEL:
 yeah! ive been sailing my whole life. when i was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.

PHOEBE:
 your own boat?

RACHEL:
 what?! what?! he was trying to cheer me up! my pony was sick.  

CHANDLER:
 do you know what i was thinkin?

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 nothing, i just like to go like this. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 uh why, do you have a lecture?

ROSS:
 no, why?

CHANDLER:
 then free as a bird. whats up?

ROSS:
 my dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.

MONICA:
 wow! thats great! dad must really like you, he doesnt ask just anyone to play.

ROSS:
 yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you.

CHANDLER:
 well, did-did you correct him?

ROSS:
 no, i-i thought it would be more fun this way.

MONICA:
 this is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.

ROSS:
 or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. he does that every week too.

MONICA:
 oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.

ROSS:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 he hates to lose.

CHANDLER:
 oh no problem, maybe ill play with my left hand.

ROSS:
 youre not a lefty? 

CHANDLER:
 does anybody know me?! 

MONICA:
 whats wrong phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 i just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!

MONICA:
 no!! why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!

PHOEBE:
  that was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and i know you wanted it as an engagement present.

ROSS:
 oh, we have to get you an engagement present?

CHANDLER:
 dont worry about it pheebs.

ROSS:
 no one got me an engagement present.

PHOEBE:
 okay, here i wish you health and happiness.   

CHANDLER:
 an old cookie?

MONICA:
  gifts!

PHOEBE:
 see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left.

CHANDLER:
 we cant accept this.

PHOEBE:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 cause its gross.

MONICA:
 no! wait! i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie! i do stuff like this at work all the time.

PHOEBE:
 really?!

MONICA:
 yeah! i bet i can do it. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, we owe you a present.

ROSS:
 two! ive been engaged twice!  waterways around new york, but in reality shes in a sound stage on the warner bros. lot and we see new york from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. rachel and 

JOEY:
  boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.   who names his boat coast guard anyway?

RACHEL:
 that is the coast guard. 

JOEY:
 what are they doing out here? the coasts all the way over there. 

RACHEL:
 joey, just ignore the boats all right? were not finished with the lesson yet.

JOEY:
 all right.

RACHEL:
 okay, im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?

JOEY:
 come on rach, not again. i got it! okay? lets start sailing, and i want to go over there  yo-ho-ho!

RACHEL:
 oh, okay. is that what you want to do? you wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? okay, lets do that sailor joe. quick question though, 

JOEY:
 uh, boat rope.

RACHEL:
 wrong! how do you get the mainsail up?

JOEY:
 uhh, rub it?

RACHEL:
 no. what do you do if i say we are coming about?

JOEY:
 id say, come again. no-no, wait i-i-i know this one, i know this one, uh 

RACHEL:
 times up, now your dead.

JOEY:
 and deaf!

RACHEL:
 okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. am i getting through to you sailor?! 

JOEY:
 yes.

RACHEL:
 dont just say yes! this isnt a game, joey you can really get hurt out here. okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!

JOEY:
 i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler.  

MONICA:
 all right, i definitely taste nutmeg.

PHOEBE:
 you do?

MONICA:
 you dont?  professional and a layman.

PHOEBE:
 that and arrogance.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 hey! how was sailing?

JOEY:
 i dont want to talk about it. yknow, you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie.   

 no-wait-no-no!!!!!!!

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 i cant believe that! now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb.   i wish you a long and happy marriage.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 hey! how was it?

ROSS:
 well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand

CHANDLER:
 i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. he even said i could call him dad.

ROSS:
 and what did he ask you not to call him?

CHANDLER:
 daddy. all right look, heres the story.   well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.   so i take off my glasses and thats when in happened. 

CHANDLER:
 guys?

ROSS:
 over here. 

 have a seat son.   hey!!   commercial break  

MONICA:
 oh my god chandler! i cant believe it!

CHANDLER:
 i know.

MONICA:
 you gave my father a lap dance!

CHANDLER:
 why do they put so much steam in there?!

ROSS:
 cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.

CHANDLER:
 why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen?

PHOEBE:
 come on, its not that big a deal!

CHANDLER:
 not that big a deal? therethere was touching of things.

ROSS:
 now, i know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?

MONICA:
 listen, im sure that dad doesnt care. he probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!

CHANDLER:
 i dont want him to tell this story for years.

ROSS:
 oh, but he will. he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp.

MONICA:
 i wasnt escaping.

ROSS:
 then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?

MONICA:
 i was trying to help out a squirrel.

ROSS:
 you were trying to eat it! 

CHANDLER:
 if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!

MONICA:
  im sorry you have the wrong number.  later dad. i love you.  

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap. and by face, i dont mean my ass. 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 i dont know. yknow, they didnt get us anything.

ROSS:
 thank you!

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 well hello! so, when are we gettin back out on the water matey? 

JOEY:
 oh uh, i dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!

RACHEL:
 why not?

JOEY:
 because! youre mean on the boat!

RACHEL:
 what? i was just trying to teach you.

JOEY:
 well, lesson learned! rachel is mean!

ROSS:
 yeeeeeep yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. i remember when she took out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all.

RACHEL:
 excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you couldnt move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.

ROSS:
 you have to respect the sea! 

RACHEL:
 look joey, im sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but i gotta tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher.

JOEY:
 does a good teacher say, "put down the beer pinhead!?"

RACHEL:
 well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?

JOEY:
 six and a half! you knocked that last one out of my hand! remember?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i didnt want you to get hit by the boom!

JOEY:
 well it hit me anyway! and it wouldve hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer.

RACHEL:
 all right, yknow what? i-im sorry. i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.

JOEY:
 you wont boss me around anymore?

RACHEL:
 i wont boss you around.

JOEY:
 and youll be nice?

RACHEL:
 and, ill be nice.

JOEY:
 and youll be topless?

RACHEL:
 andjoey!

JOEY:
 do you want me to learn?!  

MONICA:
 okay, heres batch 22. ohh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers. this has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.

ROSS:
 lets give it a shot.

MONICA:
 okay. man, i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade.

PHOEBE:
 oh, what was that for? like a bake sale?

MONICA:
 no, just a friday night. 

ROSS:
 ohh, these are pretty good.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

ROSS:
 which one was that?

MONICA:
 the ones we had right after you almost threw up.

ROSS:
 oh yeah! batch 17 was good. i did not like batch 16.   im okay.

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 okay joey honey, youre doing really good! all right, now im just gonna need you to step to the port side.   remember? remember how we talked about the port side?

JOEY:
 ohh yeah.

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 nope.

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 okay joey, were luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?  

JOEY:
 uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff i didnt know there.

RACHEL:
 joey, come on! we just went over this! 

JOEY:
 oh, yknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. did you see it? it was gross!

RACHEL:
  see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!

JOEY:
 all right thats it! youre yelling and i dont see you taking your top off! i quit!

RACHEL:
 what do you mean you quit?! you cant quit!

JOEY:
 why not?!

RACHEL:
 because youre not finished yet and i wont have it! greens do not quit!

JOEY:
 greens? im a tribbiani! and tribbianis quit!

RACHEL:
 oh my god, wait did ii just said greens dont quit didnt i? 

JOEY:
 yes! yes! you did and youre still yelling at me!

RACHEL:
 no! no! no! im not yelling at you, im just yelling near you. oh god joey, ohh im my father. oh my god, this is horrible! ive been trying so hard not to be my mother i did not see this comin. oh, joey, im sorry. im so sorry. i just wanted you to learn.

JOEY:
 well, hey i did learn.

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 yeah! come on.

RACHEL:
 awww

JOEY:
 yeah, its okay. i know what a mainsail is.   i know, i know to duck when the boom comes across. i-i know port is right.

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 damnit!  

PHOEBE:
 yknow, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that were trying to figure out her recipe. i bet shes l-l-lookin up at us and smiling right now.

ROSS:
 looking up?

PHOEBE:
 oh yeahno, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell for sure.

MONICA:
 well, ive tried everything. i give up. i guess im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  kids love that right.

ROSS:
 aww, pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have the recipe? what about, what about your sister?

PHOEBE:
 oh no-no, no, i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body. and thats not happening til october 15th, 2032.

ROSS:
 thats the day youre gonna die? seedarnit, ive got shuffleboard that day.

PHOEBE:
 thats what you think.

MONICA:
 well, i mean what about friends of your grandmothers? wouldnt they have the recipe?

PHOEBE:
 well, yknow i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse.

MONICA:
 what was her name?

PHOEBE:
 nesele toulouse.

MONICA:
 nestle tollhouse?!

PHOEBE:
 oh, you americans always butcher the french language.

MONICA:
  the recipe? 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!

PHOEBE:
 i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!! 

CHANDLER:
 so you understand, id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. yknow, im a littleim a little embarrassed about it.

 i understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer.

CHANDLER:
 what did you do when they found out?

 they never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we?   chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. you see this is a coed whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and chandler didnt 

CHANDLER:
 so i guess we wear swimsuits in here! ending credits 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 oh come on, what are you talking about? youve got three years painting houses. two whole summers at t.g.i. fridays, come on!

 its lame, i know. but im a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn

RACHEL:
 okay, hold on just a second.   im sorry, its for human resources, everybody has to do it. could you just stand up please?  

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no.   hey! 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?

MONICA:
 i cant tell you. its a secret.

CHANDLER:
 secret? married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.

MONICA:
 awww. 

CHANDLER:
 no im serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you.

MONICA:
 really? okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to ross junior year at disneyland?

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no, i cant do that.

MONICA:
 if you tell me, ill tell you what phoebe said.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, were on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.

MONICA:
 oh my god. he threw up?

CHANDLER:
 no, he visited a little town south of throw up.   so what was phoebes secret?

MONICA:
 oh, nancy thompson from phoebes old massage place is getting fired.

CHANDLER:
 thats it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?

MONICA:
 thats right! you lose sucker!!  

RACHEL:
 chandler, you have an assistant right?

CHANDLER:
  her i am sick!

RACHEL:
 no, i-i just dont know how you decide who to hire. i mean ive got it narrowed down to two people. one of them has great references and a lot of experience and then theres this guy

CHANDLER:
 what about him?

RACHEL:
 i love him. hes so pretty i wanna cry! i dont know what to do. tell me what to do.

PHOEBE:
 come on you know what to do! you hire the first one! you dont hire an assistant because theyre cute, you hire them because theyre qualified.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh. no, i hear what youre saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can i just say one more thing? 

PHOEBE:
 lets see.  you cant-you cant hire him, because thatits not professional. umm, this is for me 

RACHEL:
 okay youre right. ill hire hilda tomorrow. dumb old perfect for the job hilda!

JOEY:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 wo-women? you mean like old women?

JOEY:
 what?

RACHEL:
 yknow, all the women.

JOEY:
 hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. yknow, thats why i never had any luck with chandler.

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 all right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, its justand i know hes my assistant and i cant date himbut it just bothers me, all right?!

JOEY:
 hey! no-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! i got a great partner to pick up girls with! finally!!

CHANDLER:
 im still right here!

RACHEL:
 all right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 i just dont want him to meet anybody until i am over my crushand i will get over it. its-its not like i love him, its just physical! buti mean i get crushes like this all the time! i mean hell, i had a crush on you when i first met ya!

JOEY:
 i know, monica told me.

CHANDLER:
 did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
  

PHOEBE:
 hi.

ROSS:
 hi.

PHOEBE:
 so, how are things going with crazy? has she cooked your rabbit yet?

ROSS:
 listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayand f.y.i she mustve shown kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! and his response to each one was, "i dont give a tiny rats ass."

PHOEBE:
 yeah well, maybe she shouldve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.

ROSS:
 well, i dont think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe thats just because i am not emotionally unavailable!

PHOEBE:
 you think hes emotionally unavailable?

ROSS:
 i think he can be.

PHOEBE:
 well, maybe he wouldnt be she didnt bring the office home every night!

ROSS:
 well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!

PHOEBE:
 yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing new years eve 1997.

ROSS:
  was three years ago! she apologized and she apologized! what more do you want?!!

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 so do we!! so do we!!  im sorry you had to see that.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 wow! i did not see that coming.

 its just not really who i am. y'know, ive always been happier whenwhy am i telling you this? you dont care about this stuff.

RACHEL:
 oh no, yes i do! i do! i mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying i am happier when uh, yknow?

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
  hello?!   yeah!  

ROSS:
 my god!

PHOEBE:
 oh, im sorry. is that annoying? and speaking about being selfish in bed, hows whitney?

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 oh he knows!  

 oh hey! good, youre both here.

 we kinda need to talk.

PHOEBE:
 both of you together?

ROSS:
 wh-whats up?

 well, i went over to kyles last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing

 we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. so 

ROSS:
 oh just say it kyle!

 were gonna give it another try.

PHOEBE:
 what about her whining and her constant need for attention?!

 im gonna work on that.

PHOEBE:
 oh right, because youre so capable of change.

ROSS:
 

 i do know.

ROSS:
 it makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

 were so sorry. 

ROSS:
 thats all right, we-we dont need you. in fact, hey im over it already.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and yknow what? i dont give a tiny rats ass.

 yeah, were gonna go. 

ROSS:
  her. yknow, she did try to use sex as a weapon! yeah, i hurt my back a little.

PHOEBE:
 oh. yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to.

ROSS:
 yeah, were better off without them.

PHOEBE:
 and yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club!

ROSS:
 divorced mens club.

PHOEBE:
 potato, potaato.   ending credits  

MONICA:

MONICA:
 wow! imagine what our kids would look like!

JOEY:
 yknow, we dont have to imagine.

CHANDLER:
 im marrying her.

MONICA:
 okay, the reason why i asked you guys out to brunch today is because i have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! this is it!  hope its you!

PHOEBE:
 i hope its you.

RACHEL:
 me too!

MONICA:
 first of all um, i love you both so much and youre both so important to me

RACHEL:
 okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! who is it?!

MONICA:
 well umm, i was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. like hypothetically, if phoebe were mine

PHOEBE:
 yes!!! oh!!

RACHEL:
 hypothetically!

PHOEBE:
 still.

MONICA:
 if phoebe were my maid of honor

RACHEL:
 uh-hmm.

MONICA:
 rachel would be phoebes, i would be rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.

RACHEL:
 yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, ill do that. so who gets to be yours?

MONICA:
  decide!

PHOEBE:
 wh-why is that the best part?

MONICA:
 because then i dont have to!

RACHEL:
 well of course we will help you decide! we will do anything we can to help you! now, i would like to make a toast, to the future mrs. chandler bing  woman at the table behind them overhears chandlers name and starts listening , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that

MONICA:
 im really not deciding!

RACHEL:
 fine!  

 excuse me, i-i couldnt help overhearing, youre marrying chandler bing?

MONICA:
 yeah thats right. 

 

PHOEBE:
 aww, and good luck to you too!  opening credits  

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 hey rachel?

RACHEL:
 yeah?

PHOEBE:
 umm, when i get married will you be my maid of honor?

RACHEL:
 really?!

PHOEBE:
 uh-hmm.

RACHEL:
 oh my god phoebe! i mean im justwait a minute. if im your maid of honor that means you are monicas.

PHOEBE:
 oh! well, if thats what you want

RACHEL:
 ohh! no way phoebe! i want to be monicas!

PHOEBE:
 but why does it even matter?!

RACHEL:
 why does it matter so much to you?!

PHOEBE:
 because this one is now! and-and its two of our best friends! who knows what youre gonna marry!

RACHEL:
 what-what if i marry rossor joey?

PHOEBE:
  do this, but i-ive never been maid of honor to anyone before! and i know youve done it at least twice!

RACHEL:
 yeah but phoebe

PHOEBE:
 and no, oh please, oh please let me finish.  guess that was it.

RACHEL:
 okay. okay. itssince youve never done it before you can be monicas made of honor.

PHOEBE:
 oh, thank you so much! 

RACHEL:
 im gonna marry someone good yknow.

PHOEBE:
 oh i know.

RACHEL:
 better than chandler.    ross know that yet. as you see, they are both asleep. and theyre on the same couch. which means theyre sleeping together. not like joey is at one end and ross is on the other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. well, there hasnt been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. not that theres anything wrong with that. that is unless youre a republican in which that kind of thing will bring about the downfall of western society, especially if they should happen to want to get married. anyway, let me recap. no, there is too much, let me sum up. ross and joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at 

ROSS:
 what happened?!!

JOEY:
 well, i dont know!!

ROSS:
 we fell asleep! that is all.

JOEY:
 yeah. yep. yeah. all right, well uh, id better go.

ROSS:
 i think that would be best.

JOEY:
 yeah. all right, ill talk to you later.

ROSS:
 okay. but not about this!

JOEY:
 no! never! never! 

ROSS:
 no touch! no touch!  

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 thats sweet.

MONICA:
 no, its more like a 

CHANDLER:
 so uh, what did this woman look like?

MONICA:
 she was like 30, dark hair, attractive.

CHANDLER:
 well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

MONICA:
 come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?

CHANDLER:
 no, no i only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive  gets up and grabs a photo album.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 well, lets see  that her? 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 julie grath, my camp girlfriend.

MONICA:
 did you break up with her?

CHANDLER:
  summers, and then i broke up with her.

MONICA:
 why?

CHANDLER:
 well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow

MONICA:
 fat?!

CHANDLER:
 i did not say fat! i said, "fa-aa-aw-ow"

MONICA:
 you broke up with a girl because she was fat?!

CHANDLER:
 yeah. yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! does she still feel bad?

MONICA:
 well, apparently she does.

CHANDLER:
 well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.   seriously, good luck marrying me. 

JOEY:
 hey! whats going on?

RACHEL:
 phoebe is gonna be monicas maid of honor!

JOEY:
 hey! well i hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 see? this is exactly why you shouldnt lie!

RACHEL:
 all right thats it! i am maid of honor!

PHOEBE:
 na-uh, i am!

RACHEL:
 how come you are?!

PHOEBE:
 because i cared enough to lie!

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey-hey, i can help you decide who should do it! yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youd handle maid of honor type situations.

PHOEBE:
 what are you talking about?

JOEY:
 like when i want a job, i go to an audition and if im the best of the people they see, they give me the part.

PHOEBE:
 okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?

JOEY:
 oh uh, me and ross can be the judges.

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, come on! this is crazy! cant we just flip a coin?!

PHOEBE:
 no! coins hate me!

RACHEL:
 okay. okay fine, yknow what? we will let ross and joey decide. 

PHOEBE:
 hey there, you handsome thing. 

ROSS:
 wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as georgio. 

JOEY:
 hi.

ROSS:
 just uh, brought back your videos.

JOEY:
 uh hey look uh ross, look i think we need to talk about before.

ROSS:
 no! no we dont!

JOEY:
 yes we do! now look, that was the best nap i ever had!! 

ROSS:
 i i dont know what you are talking about.

JOEY:
 come on! admit it! that was the best nap you ever had!

ROSS:
 ive had better.

JOEY:

ROSS:
 all right! all right! it was the best nap ever!

JOEY:
 uh-huh!

ROSS:
 ive said it! okay?! but its over joey!

JOEY:
 i want to do it again.

ROSS:
 we cant do it again.

JOEY:
 why not?

ROSS:
 because its weird!

JOEY:
 fine! do you want something to drink?

ROSS:
 sure, what do you got?

JOEY:
 warm milk and excedrin p.m.  commercial break  

MONICA:
 chandler!  are!

CHANDLER:
 can you figure out what im doing?

MONICA:
 youre lewis posin.

CHANDLER:
 who?

MONICA:
 lewis posin! he was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. do you know why?

CHANDLER:
 because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!

MONICA:
 no! but because he thought i was to faaaaa.   and every time i think about it, it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade! yknow, i-i really think that you should apologize to julie.

CHANDLER:
 what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.

MONICA:
 no, i know. but yknow what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me.

CHANDLER:
 okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!  

JOEY:
 okay, all right, this is how its going to work. were gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.

ROSS:
 no, 10 is the highest.

JOEY:
 why is 10 the highest?

ROSS:
 because its the highest.  youre up first.  monica, the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet. go!  

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 okay, uh

JOEY:
 ive got cold feet.

RACHEL:
 its gonna be okay!

JOEY:
 no, one man for the rest of my life? i dont know if i can do it! this means ill never get to sleep with joey!

RACHEL:
 look monica, getting cold feet is very common. yknow, its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. and also, i ran out on a wedding. you dont get to keep the gifts.

JOEY:
  like that!

RACHEL:
 thanks!

ROSS:
 yes, very nice rachel.

RACHEL:
 thank you judges.

PHOEBE:
 ugh, what a kiss ass.

RACHEL:
 oh!

JOEY:
 okay, phoebe

PHOEBE:
 yes! your honor?

JOEY:
 were now in the ceremony, monica is about to say, "i do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. what do you do? go!

ROSS:
  that

PHOEBE:
 oh!

JOEY:
 yes! excellent! perfect score!

RACHEL:
 wait a minute! she just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!

PHOEBE:
 hey! do you want do you want a little taste of pheebs?!

ROSS:
 it is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.

RACHEL:
 ohh, wait a minute, we havent pre

ROSS:
 go!

RACHEL:
 okay! okay! umm, websters dictionary defines marriage as  forget it! umm, umm, okay, uh i met, i-i met, i met monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and i became friends with chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old. 

 oh! thats nice.

RACHEL:
 thank you. thank you very much. umm, ive known them separately and ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass   to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.

JOEY:
 wow. 

ROSS:
 yeah, it really was!

RACHEL:
 aw, thanks!

ROSS:
 okay phoebe, i guess youre next  dont see the point.

JOEY:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i cant believe that monica and chandler are getting married. i remember talking about this day with rachel while we were showering together, naked.  

JOEY:
 and shes back in the game.  

CHANDLER:
  me.

 hello skidmark.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 its pretty clear.

CHANDLER:
 ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.

 thats why you broke up with me?

CHANDLER:
 you-you-you didnt know that.  guess my work here is done!  

JOEY:
 all right, well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well. okay? you should be proud of yourselves. and-and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. well, except for racheldamnit!

PHOEBE:
 really?! i won!

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
 im sorry rach, it was, it was really close.

RACHEL:
 well then i demand a recount!  

ROSS:
 actually, it wasnt that close.

RACHEL:
 no! yknow what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculouswere gonna flip a coin!   heads! 

PHOEBE:
 the coins have finally forgiven me!

RACHEL:
 well yknow what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! 

PHOEBE:
  you guys are the best!

JOEY:
 boy i tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.

ROSS:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 yeah! i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. 

ROSS:
 why-why would i care about that?

JOEY:
 no reason, im just saying that uh thats where ill be.    

CHANDLER:
 as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that im going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.

MONICA:
 why dont you just stop doing stupid things? then you wouldnt have to apologize.

CHANDLER:
 i would really love it if could do both.

MONICA:
 all right, ii have to ask.

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again?

CHANDLER:
 what?!

MONICA:
 well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained?

CHANDLER:
 a hundred and forty-five pounds.

MONICA:
 in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! thats not the point.

CHANDLER:
 look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!

MONICA:
 well thats not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat.

CHANDLER:
 okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.

MONICA:
 how?

CHANDLER:
 you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!

MONICA:
 what if i have babies, okay? i mean im gonna look different. im okay with that, but im not sure that you are!

CHANDLER:
 look you have to realize i dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  for later! look, what i mean is youre monica! okay? and i am in love with monica. 

MONICA:
 keep going.

CHANDLER:
 so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.

MONICA:
 even if i shrink down to two inches tall?

CHANDLER:
 id carry you around in my pocket.

MONICA:
 i love you. 

CHANDLER:
 skidmarks still got a way with the ladies. 

RACHEL:
 hi pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 hi! i just want to apologize. im really sorry i was a baby.

PHOEBE:
 thats ridiculous rachel, we were all babies once.   oh, you mean today.

RACHEL:
 yeah. yeah, and yknow you-you deserve to win. and-and yknow i was thinking about it, if-if youre monicas maid of honor that means i get to be yours.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah!

RACHEL:
 yeah! oh, umm when-when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together, yknow just in case

PHOEBE:
 oh thats so sweet thanks.

RACHEL:
 here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves. and-and ohh god this is funny, look, this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride.   and look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because i was wonder woman. oh and heres a little purse that i found.  yknow i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.

PHOEBE:
 ohh.

RACHEL:
 and umm, vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause, people cry at weddings. 

PHOEBE:
 this stuff is great!

RACHEL:
 oh, i forgot this was in here. umm, this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monicas something borrowed and its blue. 

PHOEBE:
 yknow rach, i think that, i think you should be monicas made of honor.

RACHEL:
 you do? why?

PHOEBE:
 because i think it means more to you.

RACHEL:
 but pheebs, yknow you earned it.

PHOEBE:
 its fine. i mean, this is something that youve been thinking about since you were what, 14? 

RACHEL:
 no, i was ten. i just developed early.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 well, we just decided that rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.

MONICA:
  really have to start planning! i have, i have a lot of really specific ideas! we should probably get together like four times per week. you can come over to my place; well

30, my place? im so excited!  

RACHEL:
 yeah okay, you laugh now, but shes gonna be yours.   ending credits  

JOEY:

JOEY:
 pretty good.

RACHEL:
 oh good.   ahhh! my god, sorry!  

JOEY:
 okay, really good. anyway i gotta go; im late for work.

RACHEL:
 what-what?! youre gonna leave this person with me?!

JOEY:
 yeahhey, dont worry, shes a terrific girl. and hey listen, could you do me a favor? when she comes out could you just mention that im not looking for a serious relationship; thatd be great.

RACHEL:
 why?! what?! are you kidding?!

JOEY:
 just casually slip it in, yknow lay the groundwork. tell her uh, im a lonerno! an outlaw! tell her she doesnt want to get mixed up with the likes of me.

RACHEL:
 yknow what? thats a lot to remember, cant i just tell her youre a pig?

JOEY:
 hey, im gonna call her later! honest! oh come on, chandler used to do it! hed even make the girl pancakes! plus, hed make extras and leave em for me.

RACHEL:
 well forget it, im not telling that girl anything. that is not my responsibility.

JOEY:
 fine!   

 hi!

RACHEL:
 hi. 

 sorry about that, but i couldnt get that lock to work on the door.

RACHEL:
 yeah, joey kinda disabled it when i moved in.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
  opening credits 

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 wow thats actually pretty cool.

ROSS:
  wendy bagina.   what is that?

CHANDLER:
 sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system.  do in secluded corners of university libraries. for those of you who dont know what im talking about, lets just say that clothing is undone. ross gasps and the 

 

 sorry!

CHANDLER:
 you didnt bring me here to do that, did you?  

MONICA:

 she says its to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 ohmygawd! i am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? you didnt tell her we were getting married, did you?

MONICA:
 well, she saw the ring.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 well, she was shocked when i told her, but then again so were most people.

CHANDLER:
 right.

MONICA:
 well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named clark. uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. clark too.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 huh?

CHANDLER:
 you said no right?!

MONICA:
 well, she corned me! she asked if the wedding was in town! i mean, what was i supposed to do?!

CHANDLER:
 lie!!! how hard is that?! the checks in the mail! oh your baby is so cute! i cant wait to read your book ross!!

MONICA:
 come on! so she comes to the wedding! i mean it wont be so bad.

CHANDLER:
 what do you think shes just gonna sit there quietly? you dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? you dont think shes gonna want to grab the microphone and sing part-time lover?!

MONICA:
 oh my god, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!

CHANDLER:
 yknow what? its gonna be okay. yknow what? shes probably not gonna even want to come.

MONICA:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 no! that was a lie! see how easy that was?

MONICA:
 so-so you wouldve just lied?

CHANDLER:
 yes!!

MONICA:
 would it really have been that easy?

CHANDLER:
 yes!!!

MONICA:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but you always say that.

RACHEL:
 yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.

JOEY:
 look im sorry you guys, i-i just dont think so.

PHOEBE:
 whatever.

RACHEL:
 fine. 

JOEY:
 hey, dont start judging me!  whos in love with her assistant!  having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!

RACHEL:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 secret affair! 

ROSS:
 people are doing it in front of my book!

RACHEL:
 im sorry?

ROSS:
 my doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, i went to see it, and there were students makin babies right in the middle of the paleontology section!

RACHEL:
 oh my god! did you get to see anything good?

ROSS:
 let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.

RACHEL:
 yeah, there was. it wasthere the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever readyes, there was.

ROSS:
 great! because people kept showing up, i think its like uh-a thing!

JOEY:
 now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?

ROSS:
 oh for cryin out loud! 

JOEY:
 all right, so we should go catch our movie.

RACHEL:
 well now whats the rush?

JOEY:
 i like to see the previews. 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:

 hey!

JOEY:
 hey!

 joey.

JOEY:
 erin.

 hey rachel.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 oh no.

JOEY:
  

 a birthday party.

JOEY:
 whos birthday party? 

 allisons birthday party.

JOEY:
  

 32. 

RACHEL:

JOEY:
  commercial break  

ROSS:
 excuse me. hi, im a professor here. do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?

 well, yes! just give me five minutes, i just have to find someone to cover my shift.

ROSS:
 no! no!! no! can i speak to someone in charge please?!  

 how can i help you?

ROSS:
 hi, i was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the paleontology section? see i-i wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.

 we are aware of the problem you are referring too.   but as far as increasing security, im afraid the library is very understaffed. i, i cant help you.

ROSS:
 well, fine. fine! if-if im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, ill go up there and defend it myself!   and dont you follow me! 

JOEY:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 how did it go with erin?

JOEY:
 oh, unbelievable! we had the best time!

PHOEBE:
 yay!! oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?

JOEY:
 no! no! no! you guys were totally right! this is so much better than the first time we went out. yknow? that was so awkward, we were really nervous.

PHOEBE:
 didnt you sleep together?

JOEY:
 yeah that really calms me down. and! we have so much in common! she loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well thats a

RACHEL:
  joey. 

JOEY:
 okay.  

 oh. oh i just cannot believe clark stood me up!

MONICA:
 he might still show up.

 oh, what are you, stupid? its been three hours.

MONICA:
 is that all?

 i should just go on to happier things, okay? umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?

CHANDLER:
 well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. um, its going to be a small ceremony. uh, tiny! were not even sure why were having it.

MONICA:
 its actually going to be just family.

 ohwaityou two think of me as family?! oh, i have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing careless whisper or lady in red?  

JOEY:
 how can you say that?! the mets have no closer!

 what about benitez?

JOEY:
 what about game 1 of the series?

 what about shut up?

JOEY:
 you shut up!  ill be right back. 

 okay. 

RACHEL:
 so hows it goin with joey?

 uh, okay.

RACHEL:
 okay? wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? i mean tell me that you like him.

 look, hes a really great guy and i know that you really want this to work out, but i just dont see this having a future.

RACHEL:
 but you said that you liked him! i mean what happened?! did ya just change your mind?!

 kinda.

PHOEBE:
 then change it back!

 im sorry i its just theres no real spark.

PHOEBE:
 no spark? didnt you sleep together?

 yeah.

RACHEL:
 ugh, tramp!

PHOEBE:
 does joey have any idea?

 i really dont think he does. and yknow what? maybe you guys could help clue him in. yknow, tell him im-im not interested in a serious relationship or something.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you mean like that youre kind of a loner.

 yeah! that would be great!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and maybe that youre a real  and it doesnt matter what she said. its not important so i dont need 

 im sorry?

PHOEBE:
 oh well, i guess italian isnt one of the four languages you speak.

JOEY:
 

 yeah, lets go.

JOEY:
 okay. see you guys later.

 bye guys.

RACHEL:
 yeah, see ya.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 wow. well, i guess it was cupid who brought her here.

PHOEBE:
 no, just a regular old flying dwarf.  

ROSS:
 yes? yes?! how can i help you?

 yeah, we werewe were just looking around.

ROSS:
 oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars. what exactly were you looking for, hmm? perhaps,  stocks musings on the smiledon californicus?

 uhh.

ROSS:
 ah ahget out of here!  looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the  uh, meeting someone? or-or are you just here to brush up on marions views on evolution?

 uh, actually i find marions views far to progressionist.

ROSS:
 i find marions views far to progressionist.

 im sorry, who are you?

ROSS:
 im a professor here uh, rossgeller.

 ross geller, why do i know that name? its uhwait!   did you write this?

ROSS:
 yes! youre the person who checked out my book?!

 yknow, you look nothing like i wouldve thought. youreyoure so young.

ROSS:
 well i uh, i skipped forth grade.  

ROSS:
 i am veryvery sorry. 

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 so how was, how was your date?

JOEY:
 oh, it was great! i mean we walked all around the village. we went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still and guess what, im thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.

PHOEBE:
 oh really? she said she wants to go away with you?

JOEY:
 no-no-no-no-no! its a surprise, but its gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while. 

 oh no, yeah.

RACHEL:
 jo-joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? umm, i kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, shes not lookin for a serious relationship.

JOEY:
 where are you gettin this?

RACHEL:
 well, she told me. she said shes kinda a loner.

JOEY:
 oh. oh.

RACHEL:
 joey

JOEY:
 no hey rach, its cool okay? yknow im a loner too!   right?

PHOEBE:
 hey joey, yknow what? you are way to good for her.

RACHEL:
 yeah and honey i promise next time that i will just say good-bye and tell em youre not looking for a relationship.

JOEY:
 no! no. dont do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.

RACHEL:
 well that too. 

JOEY:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 do you want some pancakes?

JOEY:
   

MONICA:
 what are we gonna do?

CHANDLER:
 i say we go with careless whisper. 

 chandler?

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 janice, what umm, what are you doing here?

 well umm, i thought i was going to go back to my apartment but then i just felt i couldnt really be alone tonight.   i was wondering if i could maybe stay here with you, just i really feel that i need to be with family.

MONICA:
 

 please, its because otherwise i really dont know what i might do.

CHANDLER:
 arent you just a tinsy bit curious?

 

MONICA:
 yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.

 okay! 

MONICA:
 well justwell just let her stay.

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!

MONICA:
 kinda like your barca lounger.

CHANDLER:
 is that what youre thinking about right now?

MONICA:
 i never stop thinking about it.

 hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath.

CHANDLER:
 janice, im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.

 why not?

CHANDLER:
 honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not. 

 okay, im going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise i get very nasal.  have a cat? cause its already happening.  that?  

MONICA:
 oh my god! oh my god! you have to go!

 why?

MONICA:
 because chandler still has feelings for you!

 he does?

CHANDLER:
 say again?

MONICA:
 thats right. thats right. and that is why you cant stay here tonight. and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.

CHANDLER:
 feelings, such strong feelings.

MONICA:
 i mean, i realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.

 ohmy gawd, i-i understand. i-i am so sorry, ill go.   good-bye monica  chandler,  ending credits  

ROSS:
  yeah, in fact ive got this little baby  peoples eye  

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no. no-no-no.  

 shhhh! 

ROSS:
 what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year? 

CHANDLER:
 no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes. 

ROSS:
 what? that's like insanely easy! 

CHANDLER:
 now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen 

MONICA:
 it's a stupid game and i wasn't playing against other people, so technically i didn't lose. 

ROSS:
 what? you forgot fourteen states? 

MONICA:
 nobody cares about the dakotas.   

CHANDLER:
 oh, okay, time's up! 

RACHEL:
 all right, i got 48. 

CHANDLER:
 oh that's not bad, pheebs? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of

 regular celery. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead invegetables, joey? 

JOEY:
 say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game. 

ROSS:
 wow, how many have you got? 

JOEY:
 fifty-six!  opening credits  

JOEY:
 hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports-team! 

CHANDLER:
 does south oregon have a sports-team?  there you go.  

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 'cause you invited your assistant. 

RACHEL:
 oh, right. sorry. but tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending thanksgiving with her. 

MONICA:
 oh! why didn't you tell me? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. 

RACHEL:
 well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. 

MONICA:
 now you think i wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  i still do.

PHOEBE:
 regular celery!  that. 

ROSS:
 done! with time a-to-spare. 

CHANDLER:
 oooh that may be a new world's record   

ROSS:
 you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" hmm? 

CHANDLER:
 uh, magellan? you got 46 states. 

ROSS:
 what? that's impossible. 

JOEY:
 46. wow! who's well educated now, mr. i-forgot-ten-states? 

MONICA:
 all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food! 

CHANDLER:
 i am only one man! 

ROSS:
 no, just give me another minute. 

CHANDLER:
 look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself. 

ROSS:
 this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, but if you can'tno dinner! 

ROSS:
 you're on! 

JOEY:
  there that you don't have. 

MONICA:
  doesn't work? 

JOEY:
 but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 

MONICA:
 ross, i'm gonna use yours, okay? 

ROSS:
 pshhshhh!

MONICA:
 chandler? can you give me a hand? 

CHANDLER:
 sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 

JOEY:
 don't worry, chandler, it's not a globe of the united states.    

PHOEBE:
 hey you guys i'm gonna go out and take a walk. 

ROSS:
 phoebe, why is your bag moving? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's not! 

RACHEL:
 seriously, it's moving! 

JOEY:
 what the hell is in there? 

PHOEBE:
 it's just my knitting that's all!   yes! i knit this. i'm very good.  

MONICA:
 rosss apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often? 

CHANDLER:
 i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something. 

MONICA:
 that's my pie! 

CHANDLER:
 which smells delicious! 

MONICA:
 uh-oh! uh-oh! 

CHANDLER:
 what? 

MONICA:
 we left joey alone with the food!   yep! yep, i knew it! there he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!   

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? 

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, who's this? 

MONICA:
 phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 

CHANDLER:
 tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue! 

PHOEBE:
 no, there's no dog here? 

MONICA:
 yes there is! he's black and white and shaggy and   he's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand. 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! where are you? 

MONICA:
 i'll be right there! 

PHOEBE:
  here already? how are they doing this? 

RACHEL:
 

 i, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good. 

RACHEL:
 well, sure! come in!  girlfriend? 

 we kinda broke up this morning. 

RACHEL:
 oh, i'm sorry. 

 yeah, so she went back to ohio.

ROSS:
 ohio!! thank you!  

CHANDLER:
 huh! where is the dog?!

ROSS:
 what dog? there-there's no dog here. 

JOEY:
 yeah that dog left! 

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 there's no dog in here.  

CHANDLER:
 phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! 

PHOEBE:
 no that's just me coughing!   oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room. 

CHANDLER:
 what is it doing here? 

PHOEBE:
 well, i'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. wait.   hello, my name is clunkers. may i please stay with you nice people?

MONICA:
 oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic! 

CHANDLER:
 extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! 

PHOEBE:
 that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 

CHANDLER:
 well, it still has to go, right? 

 why? 

CHANDLER:
 okay, it's um

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 don't do what? 

CHANDLER:
   okay, i hate dogs. 

 what? 

PHOEBE:
 are you crazy? 

ROSS:
 are you out of your mind?

PHOEBE:
 why? 

JOEY:
 told ya. 

CHANDLER:
 they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. 

ROSS:
 right, they are scary.  out of my hand!!!

RACHEL:
 wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies? 

CHANDLER:
 

 you don't like puppies? 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 look, chandler, i told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. it's like ross not likin ice cream. 

PHOEBE:
 you don't like ice cream? 

ROSS:
 it's too cold. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 and i don't wanna say this, i don't you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go.   oh my god!! 

ROSS:
 how can i not get this? i'm a college professor; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s. 

MONICA:
 1250.

ROSS:
 damn, i forgot you were here. 

PHOEBE:
 all right. we're gonna take clunkers to rosss. we'll be back in a minute. 

RACHEL:
 oh, wait before you guys go, can i just ask you a question? 

MONICA:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? 

PHOEBE:
 oh, i'd say about a month. 

MONICA:
 really? i'd say 3 to 4. 

JOEY:
 half hour. 

RACHEL:
 interesting. 

MONICA:
 when it's your assistant, i would say never. 

JOEY:
 all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? all right? because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. 

RACHEL:
 huh. a moo-point? 

JOEY:
 yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. it just doesn't matter. it's moo. 

RACHEL:
  that all just make sense?

MONICA:
 please, don't listen to joey, okay. would you look at him? he-hes obviously depressed. he's away from his family; he's spending thanksgiving with strangers.   what he needs right now is for you to be his friend. 

RACHEL:
 you're right, i'm sorry. thank you. okay, that's what i'm gonna do. 

JOEY:
 fine! take their advice. no one ever listens to me. when the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.  

RACHEL:
 hey! 

 hey. 

RACHEL:
 how are you holding up? 

 not bad. 

RACHEL:
 yeah? i'm sorry about your girlfriend. 

 thanks. 

RACHEL:
 so were you guys together a long time? 

 a year. on and off. i kinda thought we'd end up together. i don't anymore. 

RACHEL:
 now that she broke up with you? 

 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 yeah. hmmmm. 

 it's weird. i always used to assume, that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. but lately it's like what if it's not. do you ever have that feeling? 

RACHEL:
 noyeah, all the time, constantly. it's terrifying. but you know that i figure itit has to work out. 

 why? 

RACHEL:
 because, uhit has to. 

 you have all the answers, don't you? 

RACHEL:
 yeah, i know, i do. i really do. 

 hey, thanks for talking to me. 

RACHEL:
 well, what is a boss for? hug it out! 

JOEY:
  should go for it! 

 what? 

JOEY:
   no, all right, i see you later, okay...  commercial break 

 what did joey say? i like you back? 

RACHEL:
 uh, yeah, well, see, he joey knows, that i'm-i'm very insecure about my back and, andyou're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!

 wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. 

RACHEL:
 no?  he said, because um, i'm attracted to you. 

 wow. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. 

   

RACHEL:
 what? 

 right there! that's my car! 

RACHEL:
 okay, that's gonna take them a minute. do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest? 

 i can't believe this! 

RACHEL:
  theyre-they're not even in the car yet!  look, there they go, okay.   

MONICA:
 okay phoebe, we should probably go back now. 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 stop it. stop! okay let's go. we can be strong.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, okay.  

MONICA:
 oh my god! did you hear that? she said monica!   oooh, i can't leave her! 

PHOEBE:
 you know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn't even know. 

MONICA:
 that's not gonna work. 

PHOEBE:
 i've had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea. he's not so smart. 

MONICA:
 hey! i didn't know either. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? 

MONICA:
 yeah, i knew.   

PHOEBE:
 where's chandler? 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 wash your hands!!!

CHANDLER:
 how did youknow?    

ROSS:
 hey! what's she doing back here? 

MONICA:
 relax, ross. she's not made of ice cream! 

ROSS:
 hey look, phoebe. i, uh, i laid out the states geographically... 

PHOEBE:
  okay, we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom. 

ROSS:
 yeah, but, but look what i'm... 

PHOEBE:
 see, this is exactly what we do not have time for.   

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 um, in phoebe's room. you can't go in there. 

CHANDLER:
 why not?  

ROSS:
 monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing. 

CHANDLER:
 well, i, i should go in there. 

ROSS:
 no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now. 

CHANDLER:
 why not? 

ROSS:
 because you sent away the dog!

CHANDLER:
 this is ridiculous. 

ROSS:
 oh, is it? is it? look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover. and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. so monica and her friendphyllistake away the dog. and that was the last time we ever saw him. don't you see? this is just like that. only with a few details changed. 

JOEY:
   what's the matter? 

CHANDLER:
 monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away. 

JOEY:
 so? bring the dog back, you're a hero. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 

JOEY:
 chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

CHANDLER:
 and that doesn't scare you? 

JOEY:
 ross, you need some help? 

ROSS:
 from you?  yes, please! 

JOEY:
  stuff up! 

ROSS:
 i hate america! when i finish this game, i swear i am moving.  

JOEY:
 hey! tag's still talking to the police. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, ohh! why, damnit, why did i open my mouth?  have a crush on you; i am attracted to you.  freaked him out 

JOEY:
 if you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.  

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 no, no he went for a walk. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!  

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 oh no-no-no-no-no-no-no! he went over to ross' to bring the dog back here! 

PHOEBE:
 oh no, the dog's not going to be there! 

JOEY:
 you think?  

MONICA:
 hi, honey. 

CHANDLER:
 please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 

MONICA:
 what? why, why would... 

PHOEBE:
  won't. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. yknow, for you, and gotten out and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i couldn't find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain.   

PHOEBE:
 we have good news, look whose back! 

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 clunkers?! oh my god! 

MONICA:
 that's right, she came back all by herself. 

PHOEBE:
 it's a thanksgiving miracle! 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in  i went to far, didn't i? when should i have stopped?  

ROSS:
 okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more! i-i think, i should be able to eat something. 

CHANDLER:
 it's up to you.  

RACHEL:
 oh, hi! how are you doing? 

 i'm okay. i gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. 

RACHEL:
 oh. 

 thanks for having me over, you guys. 

ROSS:
 tag? y-you're going?  the chance to talk. uh, so, where did you say you're from again? 

 colorado. 

ROSS:
 ah, what good are you.  

RACHEL:
 look, um, i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. 

 okay. 

RACHEL:
 ah, i-i never should have said what i said. ityknow what? it just doesn't matter how i feel. i mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what i would love is just to go to work on monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? big day monday lots to do. so, we're okay? 

 um, i'm not. 

RACHEL:
 oh, god, i know it, that i freaked you out. 

 no, you didn't. the only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. 

RACHEL:
 really? 

 yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. 

RACHEL:
 okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on monday.  ending credits   the door and chandler stumbles out into the living room, turns on the light, looks through 

ROSS:
 delaware! 

CHANDLER:
 all right. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 you got it.   you got nevada twice. 

ROSS:
 

 

ROSS:
 you sure?

 uh-huh!

CHANDLER:
 okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. 

 

ROSS:
 no-no, one daddy, two mommies. all right, its all yours. 

CHANDLER:
 okay. okay.

ROSS:
 yes! yes! yes!! 

PHOEBE:
 his first big kids bike, this is so exciting!

MONICA:
 oh yeah, i remember mine! ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, i got it, andit bent.

ROSS:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 i never had a bike of my own.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 well, we didnt have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.

CHANDLER:
 that sounds like my first bike.  dad gave me his old one.

ROSS:
 ohh.

MONICA:
 did the girl ever let you ride it?

PHOEBE:
 no! but she gave me the box that it came in. it had a picture of the bike on the front.  would drag me around the backyard.

ROSS:
 that is so unfair!

PHOEBE:
 not really, i got to drag him around too!   opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 hey! what are you guys doing? 

JOEY:
 hey.

MONICA:
 making holiday candy for the neighbors.

CHANDLER:
 im sorry, who?

MONICA:
 im gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.

CHANDLER:
 but we dont know the neighbors.

JOEY:
 i do. theres uh, lets see, guy with a mustache, smokes-a-lot lady, some kids ive seen, and a red-haired guy who does not like to be called rusty.

MONICA:
 see? this is exactly why im making this candy. we can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.

CHANDLER:
 wouldnt it be easier if we just moved?

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 eh, somebodys in a good mood!

RACHEL:
 well, why shouldnt i be? i have great friends! i have a wonderful job!

MONICA:
 where you can make out with your assistant.

RACHEL:
 come on, its not a big deal! we stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.

MONICA:
 oh yeah, whats the plan?

RACHEL:
  going to let it be a problem.

MONICA:
 wow! it took you all night to come up with that plan?!

RACHEL:
 well yknow, we did other stuff too.  

MONICA:
 did you two

RACHEL:
 oh monica come on, yknow i dont sleep with guys on the first date!

MONICA:
 matt guire, mark lynn, ben wire

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 okay.  

RACHEL:
 hi. tag, i have a conference call today is that correct?

 yes, at 4:00.

RACHEL:
 okay, thank you. thatll be all.     did you see that? that mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. 

 id better get back to my desk.

RACHEL:
 okay, you hard worker! ill remember to put that in your evaluation.

 my what?

RACHEL:
 well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. but yknow, there is one thing that i have yet to evaluate. 

 are you serious?

RACHEL:
 no, ive just always wanted to do that. can you help me clean this up?  

MONICA:
 the basket is totally empty! my god, the neighbors ate all the candy!

CHANDLER:
 well, either that or uh

MONICA:
 joey!!   

JOEY:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 did you eat all the neighbor candy?!

JOEY:
 uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time i got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. they love it!

MONICA:
 they love my candy? oh man!!! ive gotta go make more!!  

JOEY:
 hey mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it. 

MONICA:
 ross! the neighbors ate all my candy!!

ROSS:
 mine stole my newspaper! its like a crime wave!!   pheebs, you uh, you got a second.

PHOEBE:
 sure!

ROSS:
 yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike i-i couldnt stop thinking about it. i mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so   

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 you like it?

PHOEBE:
 i love it!!

ROSS:
 yeah?

PHOEBE:
 ohh!! ohh!! and i love you!

ROSS:
 ahh.

PHOEBE:
 not that way! but the bike brought you a lot closer!

ROSS:
 ah!  a test ride.

PHOEBE:
 okay! oh my god! my first bike! thank you for the best present ive ever gotten.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
   

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 dont worry, im brave! i am brave! ii am brave!   no-no-no-no!!   can you tell me who is there please? 

 my name is gary, i live upstairs. 

 hi!

MONICA:
 hi. do you know what time it is?

 its candy time! my roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.

MONICA:
 oh please! 

CHANDLER:
 

 so, can i get some candy?

CHANDLER:
 i am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! 

MONICA:
 umm, listen i am sorry, but ill put some out first thing in the morning.

 well okay, ill swing by later. do you live in this building? 

MONICA:
 um-hmm.

 

CHANDLER:
 mm! night gar!   

RACHEL:
 

 no! it was marked confidential i just sent it down to human resources.

RACHEL:
  joke for you!

 a joke they would appreciate?

RACHEL:
 im thinkin no.

 what did you say?!

RACHEL:
 umm, i said i thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that i like your tiney-tiny touchie.

 no, not my touchie.

RACHEL:
 well, it gets worse. when asked if you take initiative i wrote, "yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under problems with performance i wrote, "dear god, i hope not," and then uh, then i drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.  

MONICA:
 ross! that is so sweet of you to get phoebe that bike! when i heard the story, i almost cried.

JOEY:
 almost cried huh? hear that chandler? almost cried!

CHANDLER:
 hey, you cry every time somebody talks about titanic!

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 phoebe really likes the bike huh?

MONICA:
 oh yeah! i saw her walkin it down the street the other day. she had uh, these flowers in the basket. it was so cute.

JOEY:
 yeah, i saw her this morning walkin it by the park.

ROSS:
 wait a minute, she was walking the bike? both times? 

JOEY:
 hey pheebs?

PHOEBE:
 oh hi!

CHANDLER:
 hey! so are you enjoying the bike?

PHOEBE:
 ohh, uh-huh so much!

ROSS:
 pheebs you uhyou do know how to ride a bike dont you?

PHOEBE:
 of course!

MONICA:
 umm, can we see you ride it?

PHOEBE:
 okay.   see? commercial break  

MONICA:
 see, this is why i told you never get involved with your assistant! and here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  hear that chandler? no such thing!

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 maybe its not as bad as i think. yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way i meant it.

CHANDLER:
 absolutely! yknow, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.

RACHEL:
 ugh, i just gotta get the thing back!

JOEY:
 hey rach?

RACHEL:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 that sketch you mentioned? might it have looked a little something like this? 

RACHEL:
 oh my god! joey!

CHANDLER:
 what is the matter with you?

RACHEL:
 ugh!

JOEY:
 boy i tell ya, this little talent came in handy before i could afford porn. 

 hi! im sorry, i know its after hours but i really need candy.

MONICA:
 im sorry, i cant help you. see?  rules are rules.

 please! i have people coming from out of town today! and, i told them all about your candy!

MONICA:
 no kidding, out of towners huh? what did you tell em?

 i told em your candy is absolutely indescribable!

MONICA:
 some people have been saying its yknow little drops of heaven, but whatever.

 please, cant you help me out?

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?

MONICA:
  but you cant tell anybody!

  

 yeah, thats her.

 

MONICA:
  sign didnt work!

CHANDLER:
 yknow what would work?

MONICA:
 hmm?

CHANDLER:
 stop making candy!

MONICA:
 but they like it!

CHANDLER:
 you mean they like you.

MONICA:
 maybe.

CHANDLER:
 is that why you became a chef? so that people would like you?

MONICA:
 oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?  

ROSS:
 okay, now just remember everything i taught you and youll be fine. okay? here we go. readyset

PHOEBE:
  maybe before we start we should just get another one. perhaps, like an airplane seator a beanbag chair!

ROSS:
 phoebe, you cant get out of this! okay? you have to learn how to ride a bike!

PHOEBE:
 why? why do i have to learn?

ROSS:
 wellin-in case of emergency.

PHOEBE:
 what kind of an emergency?

ROSS:
 well let therewhat if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "you ride this bike or ill shill shoot you."

PHOEBE:
 okay, i would ring the bell to distract him and then i would knock the gun out of his hand with a chinese throwing star.

ROSS:
 okay, phoebe just-just get-get on the bike andhey! ill hold you up and-and push you. okay?

PHOEBE:
 you wont let go?

ROSS:
 no!

PHOEBE:
 swear?!

ROSS:
 i swear!

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 come on.   

PHOEBE:
 all right.

ROSS:
 all right. feel good?

PHOEBE:
 well

ROSS:
 all right, try pedaling. 

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

ROSS:
 thats it, your doing great.

PHOEBE:
 okay.

ROSS:
 doing great! yes-yes-yes! take control! yes!

PHOEBE:
 weee!!! 

ROSS:
 yes!! yes!!!  

PHOEBE:
 oh! oh! oh no!! you swore!

ROSS:
 i-i just thought you were doing so well. i

PHOEBE:
 i am shocked! shocked!!  

ROSS:
 its a legitimate learning technique.   wow!  

ROSS:
 hey, theres uh, some people outside, askin about candy.

MONICA:
 well, theyre just gonna have to wait arent they? ive only got two hands!!

ROSS:
 need some help?

MONICA:
 no! you dont know the system! therell be nobody messing with the system!

ROSS:
 by the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.    

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 i couldve been killed i hope you know!

ROSS:
 i know. i know. but, can we please try it again? huh? i mean, you were so close phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 well, i would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.   

ROSS:
 phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 what?! 

ROSS:
 all right, yknow what? if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then im sorry, im just gonna have to take it back.

PHOEBE:
 what?! why?!

ROSS:
 because! because, it-it-its itd be like you having this guitar  played! and-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you dont ride it you-youre-youre killing its spirit! 

PHOEBE:
 all right. if you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.

ROSS:
 great! great!  happy.

PHOEBE:
  please dont die! 

RACHEL:
 okay, i think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into mr. zelners office. now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.

 thats kinda sad.

RACHEL:
 yeah, well bettys kinda sad. which is why i believe i can lure her away with these chocolates.  you get in the office.

 got it!

RACHEL:
 lets roll! 

 hello rachel, you uh, got a minute?

RACHEL:
  anythingminute. okay. fine.  

 uh actually, id like to speak with both of you.

RACHEL:
 okay. uh, well can we, can we get you anything mr. zelner? maybe some chocolates? 

 umm, no. thanks, but ill give these to betty.   so i read your evaluation of tag, or to use his full name, tag sweetcheeks jones. is something going on with you two?

RACHEL:
   what would happen exactly.

 well, id be forced to file a report. id have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.

RACHEL:
 well

  evaluation.

RACHEL:
 oh no-no-no

 

 you wrote that you have a cute touchie?

  strangely proud of my butt.

 its kind of a risky joke tag, and what is-what is this drawing i cant figure out what this is?

RACHEL:
 youre lookin at it upside downyknow what?   it doesnt matter.

 yeah, its not like i dont have a sense of humor, huh? hell, i even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. but theres a time and a place, huh?! unless you uh, have a limerick right now?  youve 

RACHEL:
 whoa! i cant believe you did that. that was really sweet.

 no, dont worry about it.

RACHEL:
 no, you couldve lost your job.

 are you kidding me?! with a cute butt like this, id find work.

RACHEL:
 thank you! youre great! 

 yknow what? 

RACHEL:
 what?

 i feel great.   what?

RACHEL:
 i it justit took me so long to get that desk organized.

 oh, im sorry. 

RACHEL:
   

CHANDLER:
 

 were waiting for the candy.  candy!

JOEY:
 yeah lady! give us candy!!

ROSS:

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
  the holidays this year.

 ohh! that's great!

MONICA:
 are you gonna dress up as santa?

ROSS:
 nope. i mean, i know susan does every year, but i think i wanna take this year to teach him all about hanukkah.

PHOEBE:
 and maybe i could teach ben about the christmas skull and how people die.

RACHEL:
 you may need to use this year to teach ben about phoebe.

ROSS:
 hmm. 

JOEY:
 hey. 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 no.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 bing's weird.

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey. guess what! my landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so i guess i'll be moving out.

MONICA:
 ahh, phoebe, i'm gonna miss you!

PHOEBE:
 yes, you will be very sad. all right, well i gotta go tell rachel the good news.

CHANDLER:
 ohh! you guys gonna be living together again?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, why not?

CHANDLER:
 well, she's just so much fun with joey, i just assumed, she'd still be living with him.

PHOEBE:
 why do you think, she's having so much fun living with joey?

CHANDLER:
 no reason, exceptshetoldme.

PHOEBE:
 really? so she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?

CHANDLER:
 no! no, she didn't say that. i-i-i think you should talk to monica now.

MONICA:
 phoebe, don't worry about it. i'm sure she wants to live with you.

PHOEBE:
 you're sure? you're absolutely sure?

MONICA:
 well, no. but, um, i bet she probably does.

PHOEBE:
 probably? yeah, i don't like that word.   kind of what probably really means. yeah, uh-huh. yeah, oh, "your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? i'm sorry, but i'm not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on-on "probably!" yknow? you gotta take care of yourselves!  world history teaches us nothing! 

CHANDLER:
 bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hey! great, youre home! guess what phoebe got me for christmas! 

RACHEL:
 drums?

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 i'm sorry. but not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. um, we have a reservation under the name chandler bing.

 oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.

CHANDLER:
 forty-five minutes? we have tickets to the musicman at 8:00.

 i'm sorry. christmas is a very busy time, sir.

CHANDLER:
 is this because of the burrito thing?

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 give him money? it was a joke!

MONICA:
 no, to get a table! places like are always shakin you down. everybody wants to be paid off.

CHANDLER:
 right, calm down, o'mally. i'll slip him some money.

MONICA:
 you've got to be smooth about it.

CHANDLER:
 hey, i can be smooth.  listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, i'd appreciate it. 

 of course, sir.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 how did it go?

CHANDLER:
 had the money in the wrong hand.   

ROSS:
 wooooooo, hehehe. hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?

 no.

ROSS:
 well, i do, so let's...  uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?

 christmas.

ROSS:
 yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?

 christmas eve.

ROSS:
 yes, but also  see, you're part jewish, and-and hanukkah is a jewish holiday.

 santa has reindeers that can fly!

ROSS:
 right, um, but, on hanukkah, hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. see, years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees.

 

ROSS:
  

 

ROSS:
 

 when is santa coming?

ROSS:
 well, how about this year, instead of santa, we have fun celebrating hanukkah?

 no santa? was i bad?

ROSS:
 no! oh, no-no-no. hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, ben.

 santa's mad at me.

ROSS:
 no, hey-hey, come on,  not mad at you, okay? hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!

 so santa's coming?

ROSS:
   

MONICA:
 it's easy! just keep it casual! give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!

CHANDLER:
 how do you know so much about this?

MONICA:
 i don't know.

CHANDLER:
 richard used to do it, didn't he?

MONICA:
 we'd be eating our soup right now.

CHANDLER:
 mustached bastard

MONICA:
  give him the money and get their table!

CHANDLER:
   

 

CHANDLER:
    

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 so you like the drums! that's, that's great! yknow, i was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. all right, okay, well, apparently not! so, yay!

JOEY:
 hey-hey, pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  ready? one, two, three, four...   

 tequila!!

PHOEBE:
 that's fun.  commercial break 

 here you go.

CHANDLER:
 thank you gunther, put it there.   definitely not easier with coins.   thank you.

JOEY:
 thank you.  pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 here. 

CHANDLER:
 hey pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 hey! 

CHANDLER:
 if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?

MONICA:
 it's not just the drum noise. every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and i have to hear, "oh my eye! oh god, my eye!" i mean, it is so annoying.

PHOEBE:
 yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.

MONICA:
 phoebe, you got joey drums to annoy rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?

PHOEBE:
 maybe on some level.  

RACHEL:
 joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.

JOEY:
 what is rock 'n' roll about that?

PHOEBE:
  another present. 

JOEY:
 oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  is it?

PHOEBE:
 it's atarantula!   oh! god! rachel, look, i'm sorry. what was i thinking giving joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?

RACHEL:
 what are you talking about? i love them!  had a tarantula when i was a kid. but it-it died, because my cat ate it. and then, then my cat died. but joey, isn't this cool?

JOEY:
 is it on me? i feel, i feel like it's on me! i got, hey!  

RACHEL:
 oh, isn't that adorable? joey is afraid of the tarantula.

PHOEBE:
  is the best, i'm glad you're having so much fun here. 

RACHEL:
 what? wait-wait a minute, what? phoebe, what's the matter?

PHOEBE:
 our apartment is ready.

RACHEL:
 and that makes you angry because

PHOEBE:
 because you would rather live here with joey.

RACHEL:
 where did you get that?

PHOEBE:
 monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here. and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.

RACHEL:
 phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 hm?

RACHEL:
 did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 it wouldn't have mattered anyway, phoebe, you and i are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.

PHOEBE:
 yes, but i wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here

RACHEL:
 oh, it's so much more fun with you.

PHOEBE:
 we did have fun, didn't we?

RACHEL:
 we did!

PHOEBE:
 oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.

RACHEL:
 oh, i would love to!

PHOEBE:
 yay, okay!

RACHEL:
 good, good, good, good, good.  

PHOEBE:
 great, all right, okay, and monica ask me to make the drumming stop.

RACHEL:
   done!  

ROSS:
 hey!

 hello, sir. you're here to return those pants?

ROSS:
 no, these are my pants.

 oh. okay! how can i help you?

ROSS:
 well, uh, do you have a santa-outfit left?

 two days before christmas? sorry, man.

ROSS:
 okay look, do-do, you have anything christmassy? i promised my son, and i really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, iuh, you gotta have something.  

ROSS:
 i'm the holiday armadillo! i'm a friend of santa's and he sent me here to wish you 

MONICA:
 what happened to santa, holiday armadillo?

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 wow, come in, have a seat. you must be exhausted coming all the way fromtexas.

 texas?

ROSS:
 that's right, ben. i'm santa's representative for all the southern states. and mexico! but, santa sent me here to give you these presents, ben.   maybe the lady will help me with these presents.  

 wow! thanks!

ROSS:
 you're welcome, ben. merry christmas, ooh, and happy hanukkah!

 are you for hanukkah, too? because i'm part-jewish.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 because armadillos also wandered in the desert?

ROSS:
  the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?

 cool!

ROSS:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 come on ben. 

ROSS:
 years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...

CHANDLER:
 

 santa! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

ROSS:
 what are you doing here, santa?

CHANDLER:
 well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weirdturtle-man?

ROSS:
 i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?

CHANDLER:
 what?

 did you bring me any presents, santa?

CHANDLER:
 you bet i did, ben, put it there!    weren't so damn small! 

MONICA:
 okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo, and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence, i never thought i'd say. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!

ROSS:
 thank you, but, but you gotta leave.

CHANDLER:
 why?

ROSS:
 because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it.

CHANDLER:
 but i didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.

ROSS:
 i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me.

CHANDLER:
 fine, i'll give the suit back. 

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 santa? really?

MONICA:
 yes, is that okay?

CHANDLER:
 did your dad ever dress up like santa?

MONICA:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 then it's okay! 

ROSS:
 okay ben, santa has to go. say good-bye!

 no! why does he have to go?

CHANDLER:
 because, if santa and the holidayarmadillo?  ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas!

 no! why can't the armadillo leave? i want santa!

ROSS:
 fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay.

CHANDLER:
 well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah?

 okay, santa!  

ROSS:
 all right, it's time for the story of hanukkah. years and years ago, there were these people called the maccabees. 

JOEY:
   

RACHEL:
 oh wow! look at this place!

PHOEBE:
 oh, this is terrible. oh, theyve made so many changes i cant even feel my grandmothers presence anymoreooh! new sconces!

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 what?

RACHEL:
  grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 and remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 do you really not know where im going with this?   it left! its one huge room!

PHOEBE:
 oh no! 

RACHEL:
 see?

PHOEBE:
 well, i guess well just have to put the wall back up.

RACHEL:
 you cant, because of the new skylight!

PHOEBE:
 theres a skylight?!  wow!!

RACHEL:
 so what should we do? should we start looking for a new place?

PHOEBE:
  grandmother would not be comfortable with that.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah? startin to feel her again there are we?

PHOEBE:
 a little bit, yeah.

RACHEL:
 pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?

PHOEBE:
 you heard her too?! you have the gift!

RACHEL:
 phoebe, its okay. i like living with joey.

PHOEBE:
 are you sure?

RACHEL:
 oh please, i hate packing, its closer to work, and we do have fun. although, im really gonna miss living with you.

PHOEBE:
 oh me too.

RACHEL:
 i know.  im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair?

PHOEBE:
 no, i do not hear that.  and monica are listening to the holiday armadillo  

ROSS:
 and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for

 

ROSS:
 thats right, and thats why we celebrate hanukkah today. the end.

 awesome!

ROSS:
 yeah?

CHANDLER:
 my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt. 

ROSS:
 the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! okay ben, its time to light the hanukkah candles!  

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh.

RACHEL:
  bunnys funeral in here.

ROSS:
 come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!

RACHEL:
 oh.

PHOEBE:
 oh. 

PHOEBE:
 okay, i understand why superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the easter bunnys funeral? ending credits 

RACHEL:
 i got it!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 its back in cage!

JOEY:
 cage closed?

CHANDLER:
 ohh. mmm.

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.

RACHEL:
 oh, yknow i'm not that much of a sweet tooth. i wow. my god, so creamy. oh my god, this is the best cheesecake i have ever had. where did you get this?  

CHANDLER:
  it to us.

RACHEL:
 chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs. 

CHANDLER:
 ino! i didn't read the box before i opened it. and you can't return a box after you've opened the box.

RACHEL:
 why, why not?

CHANDLER:
 because it's too delicious.

RACHEL:
 chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong.

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.

RACHEL:
  opening credits  

JOEY:
 all right, i should get going, big day a work. yknow im in a coma? today, they do this test on me and it turns out im not brain dead.

CHANDLER:
 so

JOEY:
 ah-ah-ah mr. smartie pants, its just not my character thats not brain dead. hey, so pheebs, we still on for tonight?

PHOEBE:
 absolutely!

JOEY:
 ill see you at 8:00.

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, whats at 8:00?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i have dinner plans with joey. we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.

ROSS:
 wow, did not know that! may i say how lovely you look today?

PHOEBE:
 duly noted.

ROSS:
 thanks.  do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?

MONICA:
 what are you talking about?

ROSS:
 cousin frannies wedding, its tomorrow night.

MONICA:
 you were invited?!

ROSS:
 no.

MONICA:
 my god, i cant believe this! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited, but i thought that was it! i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable!

CHANDLER:
 well, maybe since the age of 9, frannies made some new friends.

ROSS:
 well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. let me call aunt sheryl okay? maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.

MONICA:
 yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? and if i hadnt have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too.

ROSS:
 yknow, she tried to undress me too.

CHANDLER:
 i used to undress my cousin glenn.    

PHOEBE:
 joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet?!!

RACHEL:
 umm, i think hes still out. whats wrong?

PHOEBE:
 well, ill tell you rachel karen green, i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note. 

RACHEL:
  you later. big daddy." 

PHOEBE:
 oh thats a nickname we were trying out.

ROSS:
 hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? the ross-a-tron!  

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh! heres joseph francis!

JOEY:
 oh-wha-ho! what are you middle naming me for?! i left you a note!

PHOEBE:
 so what?! that doesnt give you the right to ditch me!

JOEY:
 hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!

ROSS:
 phoebe hes right, that is the rule.

PHOEBE:
 i dont accept this rule. when me make plans, i expect you to show up. okay, i cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better! yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this   is for life!

JOEY:
 wow! im so sorry; i had no idea it would bother you this much.

PHOEBE:
 well, it does.

JOEY:
 okay, can i-can i make it up to you? huh? im sorry.  about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! ill pay for myself!

PHOEBE:
 okay, you wore me down.

ROSS:
 hey joe, while youre over there how about another beer for the ross-a-tron?

JOEY:
 the rossis that back?!!   

RACHEL:
 hi!

CHANDLER:
 another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again!

RACHEL:
 so just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?

CHANDLER:
 i cant seem to say goodbye.

RACHEL:
 are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?

CHANDLER:
 well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!

RACHEL:
 it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  whole mouth just filled with saliva! 

CHANDLER:
  hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.

RACHEL:
 yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.

CHANDLER:
 good idea. where do you want to go to lunch?

RACHEL:
 mommas little bakery, chicago, illinois.   

JOEY:
 awww! mel torme died.

MONICA:
 joey, that papers like a year old!

JOEY:
 aw! does that mean the sam goodys sale is over?!

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey.

ROSS:
 so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasnt a mistake. ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.

MONICA:
 limited seating?! 

ROSS:
 well yeah, but she doesnt know that. i mean, the last time she saw you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. 

MONICA:
  not the reason shes not inviting me!

ROSS:
 oh whats the big deal?! i wasnt even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. and-and yknow what? if it makes you feel any better, joan and i will just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as a sign of protest.

MONICA:
 joan?

ROSS:
 yeah, joan tedeski my date. shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department. tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!

MONICA:
 wait a minute, you got ross gellar and guest?! i wasnt invited and you got "and guest?!"

JOEY:
 uh-uh, excuse me, i do have to interrupt on rosss behalf. i-i think the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!

ROSS:
 what? i cant cancel on joan!

MONICA:
 why not?!

ROSS:
 becdid you not hear me?! shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department, okay? theyre wild! why do you want to come anyway?

MONICA:
 because! shes my cousin. i mean, we grew up together! were family yknow? well thats important to me.

ROSS:
 okay, all right, ill take you. ill go call joan. 

JOEY:
 aww thats nice. family should be there, huh? this is her wedding, happiest day of her life.

MONICA:
   

CHANDLER:
 well, thank you for lunch.

RACHEL:
 what? wait a minute, i didnt pay, i thought you paid!

CHANDLER:
 so apparently we just dont pay for food anymore.   do you see what i see?

RACHEL:
  

CHANDLER:
 mrs. braverman must be out. 

RACHEL:
 she could be out of town. maybe shell be gone for months.

CHANDLER:
 by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.

RACHEL:
 no that could kill her.

CHANDLER:
 well, we dont want that.

RACHEL:
 no so were protecting her.

CHANDLER:
 but we should take it.

RACHEL:
 but we should move quick.

CHANDLER:
 why?

RACHEL:
 because i think i just heard her moving around in there.

CHANDLER:
 go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go!

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 what do we use to split it?

RACHEL:
 okay! 

CHANDLER:
  theres more crust on this side. yknow? so, maybe if i measured

RACHEL:
 oh for god sake just pick a piece!

CHANDLER:
 all right, ill pick that one. 

RACHEL:
 thats also the smaller piece.  there you go. enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. no sharing. no switching, and dont come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast.  that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her  oh!!!!

MONICA:

ROSS:

ROSS:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 you invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! why?! whatwhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? what could i have possibly done?! 

 i believe you know my husband. 

ROSS:
 so its really a question of who could you have possibly done.  

 oh, i hate this but i-i-i have to go. i-i cant miss my flight.

PHOEBE:
 are you sure? ill bet theres another flight to minsk in like

 july. umm, 

PHOEBE:
 thats really beautiful. what does it mean?

 please, clean my beakers. i dont get out of the lab much.

PHOEBE:
 thats good. i got to admit, i thought it was something else.

 yeah, i well i really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, i figured i probably shouldnt because yknow, ihave to leave.

PHOEBE:
 youre right! youre right. dont say it. 

 i-i do though.

PHOEBE:
 i do too. 

 bye phoebe.  

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 no im not okay. the only guy ive ever been crazy about has gone to minsk and i may neveri may never see him again. 

JOEY:
 hey, yknow you could always visit him.

PHOEBE:
 oh right, like theyre gonna let me have a passport.

JOEY:
 anything i can do? whatever you need.

PHOEBE:
 wellbutnow, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles yknow before he does, then he can come back. 

JOEY:
 i can give it a shot.  

RACHEL:
 oh! yay! look! theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 oh i dont-i dont know.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 i know, just quick-quick question, quick question. which one was deep impact and which one was armageddon?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 sorry, i justcant sleep. ooh!   where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? because every time i look at that cover im like

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
    decides to make some warm milk. he opens up the cabinet to get a pot and manages to knock 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 with a wok?  read my boring book to put you asleep.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?   tag! im serious! this isnt funny! those contracts absolutely had to go out today!

 rach, im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!

RACHEL:
 yes i did! and i put a little post-it on it that said, "must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then i put a little heart in the corner because i didnt want to seem to bossy.

 im telling you, you never gave them to me.

RACHEL:
 yknow what tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.

 no, i would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!

RACHEL:
 or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!

 you wanna go down to the office right now?

RACHEL:
 no! come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.

 okay i understand.  either.

RACHEL:
 okay get your coat!   oh! when did you unhook this?   

JOEY:
 all right, it wont go down any further. its stuck.

ROSS:
 ugh. well, were just gonna have to jump.  now, were gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. so, when you get down thereyou go up to the roof and you let me in.

JOEY:
 oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! i have to do it?!

ROSS:
 yeah! oh yeah, youll be fine! it-itll be uh, just like bungy jumping. yknow? but instead of bouncing back up you-you wont.

JOEY:
 what if i smack my head on the concrete?

ROSS:
 well, im gonna lie to you joey, its a possibility.

JOEY:
  what, lets flip to see who does it, okay? you-you call it in the air, all right?

ROSS:
 oh, all right.   can you-can you see what it is?

JOEY:
 no.

ROSS:
 okay. well, you be careful.

JOEY:
 what? no! no ross! no-no! stop! im not jumping! okay, look i have an audition tomorrow and i cant go if i break my leg.

ROSS:
 well im jumping! i have a son! okay? he wont have a father if-if i die!

JOEY:
 well all right so, it looks like were even!  

PHOEBE:
 okay. so, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.  do  and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has  well done, pheebs.  to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke   

MONICA:
 okay, heres your milk. what do you want to talk about?  

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 ohh! ohhhh! were you sleeping sweetie? im sorry. here.   

 okay! feel free to look, but im telling you those contracts are not on this desk.

RACHEL:

 its my sister.

RACHEL:
 okay, very cute braces. anyway yknow what, the point is tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.  

 so when do you imagine you gave them to me? in the morning or in the afternoon?

RACHEL:
 in the afternoon. mr. zelner came into my office after lunch. he put them on my desk, and then i put a post-it on it  the folder with the post-it on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave  that said, "must go out today." so you just keep looking in there! all right? commercial break  

 its not here.

RACHEL:
 puzzler. a bit of a puzzle. why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?

 how could i have left them in the copy room?

RACHEL:
 i dont know tag! how can your genitals make phone calls? okay? its not a perfect world! just go please.

 fine.

RACHEL:
 thank you.   hello?   i still dont get it.  

MONICA:

JOEY:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 you put these on my desk!

 i did not!

RACHEL:
 oh really? so youre saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!  

 how did you know they were in my bottom drawer?

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
   oh! hi, officerfireman, can-can i help you?

 we found your fire alarm in the trash chute.

PHOEBE:
 thats not mine.

 yes it is.

PHOEBE:
 how do you know?

 the next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "property of phoebe buffay not monica."

PHOEBE:
 okay do youokay, do you have a search warrant? because the last time i checked this was still america!

 please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.

PHOEBE:
 fine!  from going off!

 theres a reset button under the plastic cover.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 i would say that.

JOEY:
 face to face, yeah!

ROSS:
 okay, here i go.

JOEY:
 all right.  

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 i prefer not to answer that right now, im still carrying a little holiday weight.  torso, but that doesnt work very well and hes forced to wrap his legs around 

JOEY:
 yknow, when we talked about face to face, i dont think we thought it all the way through.

ROSS:
 so what do you want me to do?

JOEY:
 well, just shimmy down me and drop! 

ROSS:
 hi.

JOEY:
 hi.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 its still looks pretty far!

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 as in rosita does not move.

RACHEL:
 joey, its just a chair! whats the big deal?

JOEY:
 the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and its at the perfect angle so you dont get any glare coming of off stevie.

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 no!  oh what does he know! come on rosita, us chichas got to stick together!   you bitch! opening credits

CHANDLER:
 couldnt i just say, "this is ross?"

ROSS:
  

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:

ROSS:
 i cant believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. man, some-some strangers gonna be living in my room.

MONICA:
 well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, its time the velvet ropes came down.

ROSS:
 they kept your room for a while.

MONICA:
 oh please! dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out! i gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of victorias secret catalogues, not a gym!

ROSS:
 come on, you know they love you.

MONICA:
 as much as they love you?

ROSS:
 i was their first born! they thought she was barren! its not my fault.

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 ugh, i hate this year!

ROSS:
 whats wrong with this year?

PHOEBE:
 well okay, its already february and ive only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!

MONICA:
 that was me and ross.

PHOEBE:
 oh thats right!

ROSS:
 hey, yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash? some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.

MONICA:
 oh thats a great idea. youre really good on the phone.

PHOEBE:
 yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had. yknow, i probably wouldnt have to say spank as much.   

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, like you never called!  

 so basically this is very easy. you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i can do that! oh, by the way, i love my office.

 

PHOEBE:
 oh okay. umm, all right.   hi, this is phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please?

 im the supply manager.

PHOEBE:
 umm, okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs.

 we dont need any toner.

PHOEBE:
 oh okay, well im sorry to bother you. bye-bye.   yeah youre right, this is easy.

 okay, what was wrong with that call?

PHOEBE:
 oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude.

 theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner, but thats okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

 so, i think youre ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?

PHOEBE:
 no.  

CHANDLER:
 joey! joe!   full bag.  something terrible mustve happened here!   oh no-no-no-no-no-no!   

ROSS:
 dad?

 im here!

ROSS:
 

 hi. god, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.

ROSS:
 dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.

 well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.

ROSS:
 

 im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.

MONICA:
 oh, thats okay, i cant wait to see everything again! all of the memories

 well, i dont know whats in the boxes down here, but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic.

MONICA:
 i used to love to play restaurant.

ROSS:
 yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.

MONICA:
 hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! 

 so, i think youre boxes are over here.  

ROSS:
 wow! great!  cigarettes are these?

 i dont know. they-they must be your mothers, but please, please dont ask her. ill throw these away.  

ROSS:
 cool! dad! my report cards! hey, check this out dad,  math, a. science, a. history, a. gym oooh, my rock polisher!

 oh look, look theres your old makeup kit!

ROSS:
 its a clown kit! clown kit!

 well, the white seems to be untouched.   uh-oh.

ROSS:
 what?

 yknow how the garage floods every spring?

ROSS:
 how are you ever going to sell this place?

 i think i accidentally used monicas boxes to keep the water away from the porsche.

ROSS:
 oh no. dad! dad! what  oh godeverythings ruined! dad, shes gonna be crushed!

 you dont secretly smoke do you?

ROSS:
 no!

 so its just your mother then. 

PHOEBE:
  your supply manager please?  empire office supplies id like to talk to you about your toner needs.    they cut back and forth between phoebes and earls offices with each of their 

 i dont need any toner.

PHOEBE:
 im hearing what youre saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.

 not me.

PHOEBE:
 may i ask why?

 you wanna know why. you wanna know why?

PHOEBE:
 i surely do!

 okay, i dont need any toner because im going to kill myself. 

PHOEBE:
  toner? commercial break 

 okay, sono toner today. thanks anyway, bye-bye.

PHOEBE:
 no-no wait-wait! i cant just let you hang up! just please talk to me.

 welli only have one thing to do today.   i guess i could push it back.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! now, why do you want to kill yourself?

 its just that i uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows i exist!

PHOEBE:
 chandler?

 i-im sorry?

PHOEBE:
 no look, i-im sure that people know you exist!

 oh yeah? i work in a cubicle surrounded by people. ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. hang-hang on.  im gonna kill myself!  get back to ya.      ehh, nothing. nothing. 

CHANDLER:
 my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita!  door, grabs the back of rosita, and we can hear joey and rachel talking as they are coming 

RACHEL:
 you will like it!

JOEY:
 no i wont. 

RACHEL:
 you dont even know!

JOEY:
 because, i know what i like and what i dont like! its not the same thing!  

RACHEL:
 well look, if you dont like this 

JOEY:
 i dont know why you say that so soon. 

RACHEL:
 come on joey, i just bought you a new chair! the most expensive one in the store! hey, yknow what i was thinking? we could name her francette.

JOEY:
 francette? what is she? a couch? 

JOEY:
 poor thing. cut down in her prime.

RACHEL:
 joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. yknow, start the heeling process?

JOEY:
 well, i guess youre right. maybe, maybe ill take her down to the incinerator. its gonna be so said, and kinda cool.  but it doesnt come off. so he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and  shes heeled!

RACHEL:
 thats weird.

JOEY:
 no its not weird, its a miracle!

RACHEL:
 its not a miracle joey! im sure theres some explanation.

JOEY:
 oh there is! if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!

RACHEL:
 joey, i really dont

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 well no.

JOEY:
 miracle!

RACHEL:
 no, yknow what? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! or something!

JOEY:
 someone like anangel?

RACHEL:
 thats right joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. 

JOEY:
    

 well, shell understand right? its not like i did it on purpose.

ROSS:
 dad that wont matter to her. look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! see, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.

 oh my god, does she really thinks that?

ROSS:
 well, can you blame her?

 well i dont know, i-i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! the doctor said your mother could

ROSS:
 dad, dad i dont want to hear about it.

 really?

ROSS:
 well, not right now. okay look, monica came here for some memories and damnit, were gonna give her some! okay, grabgrab some empty boxes. okay? well-well take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers well-well put em in their. 

 great!

ROSS:
 like uh yknow like this! this!   she-she couldve made this!

 sure!

ROSS:
 right? and this! 

 

ROSS:
 sure! ooh-ooh, what about this?

 your make-up kit? id feel better.   in the newly arrived francette. francette is one of those new chairs from la-z-boy that has and does everything except cook and go to the bathroom for you. its got a small refrigerator under one armrest it has phone jacks for the internet and regular 

RACHEL:
  this chair for myself!

JOEY:
 yeah, me too. 

RACHEL:
 hey, howshows the uh, miracle chair?

JOEY:
 fine.

RACHEL:
 yeah? wow! yknow, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!

JOEY:
 no. really?

RACHEL:
 yeah! you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio!

JOEY:
  

PHOEBE:
 earl, youre not hearing me! all im saying is that youre not alone all right? everybody hates the people they work with!  

 

PHOEBE:
 wait, what was that? that sounded like someone being nice to you.

 no! thats just the "hey guy" guy. he says that to everybody! hes the worst! id like to take him with me!

PHOEBE:
 all right so earl, lets just forget about the people at the office, okay? there-theres gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! what about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?

 

PHOEBE:
 oh sorry, boyfriend!

 oh no.

PHOEBE:
 no, whatever! anything!

 hey guy!

PHOEBE:
 yeah, hes gotta go.

 okay, i should, i should probably be getting back to my thing now. see ya. 

PHOEBE:
 no! im not finished yet! dont! dont you dare hang up on me!!!

  girls good.  

MONICA:
 hey guys! hey!

ROSS:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey, i just whipped us up some easy bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.

  days!

ROSS:
  memory.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 well, these. these are yours right here.  

MONICA:
 okay.  

ROSS:
 yeah. yeah, oh you loved that thing. you always had it with you. you never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.

MONICA:
  staying inside the lines.

ROSS:
 nu-uh! 

MONICA:
 

 oh, yeah you loved that glove! you took it every place you went. you never went any place without that glove.

MONICA:
 wow! look at this!  into this shirt!   oh, this is yours. 

ROSS:
 oh, i dont know how that got in there.

MONICA:
   hey, this isnt, this isnt my stuff! ugh, ross! 

ROSS:
 umm, your boxes are umm

MONICA:
 what?

ROSS:
 dad?

 well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. im sorry.

MONICA:
 just mine?

 im afraid so.

MONICA:
 so why-why wasnt rosss stuff ruined?  the words medical marvel im going to easy bake your head!

 well, i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche.

MONICA:
 so wait, rosss stuff is fine, but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!

 there was also leaves and guk and stuff.

MONICA:
 i cant believe this! 

   commercial break  

RACHEL:
 hey chandler!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore.

RACHEL:
 well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment?

CHANDLER:
  making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year?

RACHEL:
 i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000.  

CHANDLER:
 thats awesome! thats great! what made you do it?!

RACHEL:
 well, its a long story, but umm i broke joeys chair

CHANDLER:
 whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joeys chair?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 i thought i broke joeys chair! thats why i replaced it with mine!

RACHEL:
 ohhhhh. thats how it got fixed!

CHANDLER:
 well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?

RACHEL:
 noo! 

CHANDLER:
 im gettin my chair back!  

RACHEL:
 what? wh-hey! 

JOEY:
 well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now! 

CHANDLER:
 joey you broke my chair!!

JOEY:
 your chair?!

RACHEL:
 yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!

JOEY:
 so, there was no miracle?!

RACHEL:
 no joe, no miracle.

JOEY:
  glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh! nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap! 

CHANDLER:
 i think i should get the chair! 

JOEY:
 how do you figure?

CHANDLER:
 because you   broke a chair! the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!

RACHEL:
 no-no-no! this chairs not going anywhere.

CHANDLER:
 well, wheres the logic in that?!

RACHEL:
 the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!

CHANDLER:
 so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing! 

JOEY:
 thats right!

CHANDLER:
 what are you guys? like a gang or something?! 

JOEY:
 yeah! we are! 

RACHEL:
 were the cobras! 

PHOEBE:
  the supply manager around here.

 sorry, i dont know any earl.

 

PHOEBE:
 

 phoebe? the lady who sells toner?

PHOEBE:
 umm, look it, you-you cant kill yourself.

 

PHOEBE:
 no-no i cant! i cant let you do it!

 why?!

PHOEBE:
 because it was fate that made me call you today!

 i thought it was toner.

PHOEBE:
 no! think about it okay? this isnt even my regular job! okay? and my first day on the job, youre my first call! and-and somebody else mightve hung up on you, but i wouldnt do that because i know about this stuff. my mom killed herself.

 really?!

PHOEBE:
 yes.

 how?

PHOEBE:
 im not gonna give you tips! look dont you see that this-thisthis all came together so that i could stop you from doing this.

 couldnt it just be a coincidence?

PHOEBE:
 no, its fate!

 it doesnt really seem like enough to be fate.

PHOEBE:
 oh. well umm, okay heres a weird thing. my mother was also a supply manager.

 im actually the office manager.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! so was she! and! get this, okay? your-your name is earl, right? her name was pearl, p-earl.

 well, was there anything else?!

PHOEBE:
 sure! 

 philadelphia.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! so was she! oh, ive got-ive got goose bumps.  

 

PHOEBE:
 well, yknow im wearing layers and its warm.

 yeah-yeah.

PHOEBE:
 but ifno look, okay. these jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! and that says a lot!

  because the universe cares! the whole universe!   i really wished theyd care just a little bit though.

PHOEBE:
 yknow, i dont-i dont think its you. this is a freaky place. 

 yeah.  

MONICA:
 oh, this terrible! everything is destroyed! look at this.   it obviously meant enough for me to save it, and i dont even know what it is! ohh, its still soft.   what do you think this is?

ROSS:
 all right. i think it was a mouse.  

 

MONICA:
 how do you think i am?! youve wrecked all my childhood memories. you love ross more than me. and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face! 

 sweetheart, we love you just as much as ross! now, im sorry about everything that happened and id probably never be able to make it up to you, but heres a start. 

MONICA:
 

 its the key to my porsche. well, the key to your porsche.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 

 ive been thinking about getting rid of it. i was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. your mothers right, i do look like an ass.

MONICA:
 wait, youre giving me your porsche, youre kidding me right?!

ROSS:
 well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! i mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a porsche?!

 

MONICA:
 all right!

ROSS:
 well, what about me?! im a medical marvel!! ending credits  

JOEY:

 rach! come on! rach!

MONICA:
 its your birthday!

 

CHANDLER:
 

 ms. green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. she would appreciate it if you dont use the words old or downhill or  still look pretty damn good. 

JOEY:
 they do!

PHOEBE:
 rachel! come on out! monica made breakfast!

MONICA:
 chocolate-chip pancakes! 

ROSS:
 weve got presents! 

RACHEL:
 good ones?

MONICA:
 they all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.

RACHEL:
 well, can i keep the presents and still be 29?

JOEY:
 come on rach! look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.

ROSS:
 oh really. is that how you felt when you turned thirty?  

JOEY:
  me!!  

RACHEL:
 yknow, im still 29 in guam.

ROSS:
 hey, 30 is not that old! do you know how old the earth is?

RACHEL:
 late thirties? oh come on you guys! is it just me? am i overreacting to this?

CHANDLER:
 no rach, its not just you. my thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun.  

JOEY:
   why are you doing this to us?!  opening credits 

MONICA:
 rach, youre in a great place in your life. come on, youve got a great job! good friends

JOEY:
 yeah, youre roommate is a soap opera star.

RACHEL:
 look, yknow i know my lifes going pretty well, but i look around and i just see so many people whove accomplished so many other goals by the time theyre thirty.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but you shouldnt compare yourself to me.  tape across the road and everyone is cheering phoebe as she bounces around the corner on a 

 come on phoebe! you can do it phoebe! come on!

RACHEL:
 there you go! 

PHOEBE:
 i did it! one mile on a hippity-hop! thats it!! thats everything i wanted to do before i was thirty. oh, except i wanted to patch things up with my sister. but oh well. yay!!  godsend if you know what i mean.   

RACHEL:
 thirty. ugh, i mean thirty! monica, do you remember mean, old mrs. kreeger in the fifth grade? she was thirty!

 come on, lets have some fun. huh?  today?

RACHEL:
 nothing. i dont want to do anything.

MONICA:
 well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like ross.

ROSS:
 hey! that was a practical purchase! i needed that car for transportation! okay? i-i have a child!  one of the better british sports cars ever made. of course, better is a relative term. which reminds me of a joke. why dont the british make computers? because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil. anyway, the gang is all 

ROSS:
 how hot do i look in this, huh?!

CHANDLER:
 ross, a sports car? wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?

ROSS:
 thats not what this is about okay? i-i am a sports car enthusiast. i have always been into cars.

JOEY:
 hey, whats the horsepower on this thing?

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 i cant believe you bought this.

RACHEL:
 really! god ross, what were you thinking?  its really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.

PHOEBE:
 oh, well get in line missy. 

ROSS:
 hop in.   can be rarities with british sports cars with their lovely lucas ignition systems,  anyway, this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper, likewise with the car behind him. hes completely boxed in and cant move more than two inches. he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no 

ROSS:
 damnit! 

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 yknow what? i am going to do something today. im not just gonna sit around like some old lady. im gonna get something pierced. like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.

PHOEBE:
 really?! cause yknow that hurts.

RACHEL:
 so what?! yknow what? the way i see it ow! son of a bitch!!

 look rachel, i know what youre going through. im totally freaked about turning 25.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 all right rach, for what its worth, i think that youre doing great. i mean yknow lets face it, no one handles this well.

PHOEBE:
 least of all you.

 why? what youd do?

MONICA:
 werent you asked to leave sonny?  in formal wear to give monica a surprise birthday party. joey is coming out of the 

CHANDLER:
  minute!

JOEY:
 but it hurts my joeys apple.

CHANDLER:
  individual man.  

  chandler. everything looks so lovely.

CHANDLER:
 oh well, not as lovely as you. i mean, i cant believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  you would have a tux thats thirty years old!  

 its older than that. ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.

CHANDLER:
 ohh! 

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 okay! okay! everybody down! everybody down!  lights and everyone crouches. as everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the 

 crap. 

CHANDLER:
  whats going on.  

MONICA:
 heyyy!! you got the door open!! 

CHANDLER:
 hey-hey are you drunk?

MONICA:
 nooo!  joeys doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment.  whoa!  little nervous about turning  for some drinks. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, here is the thing. we have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! all of your friends are in there and your parents!

MONICA:
 noo!!!

CHANDLER:
 yes!

MONICA:
 noo!!

CHANDLER:
 yes!!

MONICA:
 oh no! my parents have never seen me drunk! 

CHANDLER:
 okay, heres the thing. were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.

MONICA:
 really?! you promise?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ill take care of it.

MONICA:
 okay. i love you so much. 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 what about your breath?! 

CHANDLER:
 thats still yours. okay, now remember its a surprise party. so, when you go in, act surprised.

MONICA:
 okay. i can do that.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

 surprise!!!  commercial break  

ROSS:
 okay, forward. forwardstop!   okay, backstop!   okay, forwardstop! stop! stop!

MONICA:

JOEY:
 well actually

ROSS:
 no-no-no! its mine! its-its mine.  

JOEY:
 dude, you soooo need this car.

PHOEBE:
  im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. you guys push it forward so ross can drive out of his spot. okay? all right, here we go.  reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as ross jumps in behind the wheel.  haul ass!!!!     

PHOEBE:
 happy thirtieth birthday! here!  for the child in you, and the woman. happy thirtieth!

 right, why do you keep saying that?

PHOEBE:
 because its our thirtieth birthday.

 yeah, no were not thirty. were 31. okay.  

PHOEBE:
 wait! 

 oh, its you.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. what?!

 yeah, were not thirty, were 31.

PHOEBE:
 nu-uh!

 yea-huh! thats what is says on my birth certificate.

PHOEBE:
 you have your birth certificate?

 yeah, i got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.

PHOEBE:
 our mom.

 

PHOEBE:
 do you have my birth certificate?

 no, i sold it to a swedish runaway.

PHOEBE:
 

 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 i just lost a whole year of my life.

 

PHOEBE:
 your middle name is pamela?

 yes.

PHOEBE:
 well, i never knew mine. do you remember what it is?

 yes! phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 thats my first name.

 right, okay, then no. 

CHANDLER:
 okay before we start the celebration, monica has to go put on her party dress.

MONICA:
 yay!

CHANDLER:
 see?  and has to pass in front of mr. geller whos sitting at the table and mrs. geller 

 happy birthday, sweetie! give us a hug! 

  blow. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 phil!

CHANDLER:
 now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.   okay,  doing fine. 

PHOEBE:
 hey, whats going on?

CHANDLER:
 monicas a little drunk.

PHOEBE:
 yay! i love drunk monica!

MONICA:
 awwwww 

CHANDLER:
  to know shes drunk.

PHOEBE:
 ohh! all right! all right. heres what well do, ill get twice as drunk as monica and then no ones will even notice her. 

RACHEL:
 whats-whats going on? phils really pissed!

CHANDLER:
 monicas wasted.

ROSS:
 maybe that will liven up this party.

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for joey.

JOEY:
 yep.  

 

RACHEL:
 ahh!

 it wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 no! no-no, i love it. thank you. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, open ours next. open ours next!

RACHEL:
 okay.

JOEY:
 now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?

CHANDLER:
 for my last birthday you gave me a hug!  the card! read the card!

RACHEL:
 okay.  better to be over the hill   all our love monica and chandler.  yeah!

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no! that was the joke!

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 no, because youre not a grandmother!

RACHEL:
 no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i dont have any of those things. thats why its so funny. 

MONICA:
 all you had to do was buy the card!  

ROSS:
 hey! look whos back! its the birthday girl! hows the birthday girl feeling?

RACHEL:
 well, i feel fine, but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.

ROSS:
 what?  

RACHEL:
 okay! yknow what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i wanna have three kids

PHOEBE:
 oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.

RACHEL:
 as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years. i love this plan! i wanna marry this plan!

PHOEBE:
 if you could do that, id marry the hippity-hop.

RACHEL:
 so, if i wanna have my kid when im 35, i dont have to get pregnant until im 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant

MONICA:
 really! that long?!   look all you want, its happening!

RACHEL:
 no, so i dont have to get married until im 33! thats three years, thats three whole yearsoh, wait a minute though. ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and id like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty.

ROSS:
 which is fine! because you just turned twenty-eight!

RACHEL:
 no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry!  scooter. he gives a hearty thumbs up to the group and rides off, with joey following 

JOEY:
 will you quit hoggin it! commercial break  

RACHEL:
  how to walk.

ROSS:
  im a little drunk. 

CHANDLER:
  that over here please? 

JOEY:
  tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 you are so handsome! i wanna make love to you right here, right now! 

ROSS:
 i really wish that you wouldnt.

CHANDLER:
  more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and dont talk to anyone.

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

  for one second!

 oh-ho, i think its nice.

CHANDLER:
 i think its necessary. 

MONICA:
 i-i-i wanna thank you all for coming. my family and my friends

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 i really like to say that im-um  id really like to say? im drunk!!  thats right mom and dad your little harmonica is hammered!!   and guess what! ive been drunk before! and ive smoked a cigarette! and i got a box of ding-dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! its all okay. its okay because i turned thirty today. and, and i can do anything i want! because i am a grown up.  

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 thats not gonna happen. no. 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

ROSS:

 wait! i think i see where youre going, but before you say anything else, can i just say one more thing? 

RACHEL:
 well said. and a uh good example of the fun i was referring to uhh, but i just think im past the point where i think i can yknow, just have fun.

 rachel, dont do this. this is just because youre turning thirty.

RACHEL:
 yeah, it is! but youre just a kid! i mean youre 25!

RACHEL:
 oh god! yknow what i wish? i wish you were six years older. well actually, if im wishin for stuff, i actually wish i was six years younger.

RACHEL:
 yeah, im sorry.  

CHANDLER:
 hey! howd it go?

RACHEL:
 oh, if i only want two kids, can i keep him for another year?

PHOEBE:
 you did the right thing.

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
 well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.

ROSS:
 god, do you realize in ten years were gonna be 40?

JOEY:
    

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

ROSS:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 im glad youre here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 whats the matter? you okay?

RACHEL:
 yeah, its just yknow

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.

RACHEL:
 oh! i would love to read a poem.

CHANDLER:
 do you think you could get through a poem?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 okay, so ross will be doing the reading.

RACHEL:
 ohhh

ROSS:
 okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too.

CHANDLER:
 too?

ROSS:
 yeah, i kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.

MONICA:
 do you mind telling us what it is?

ROSS:
 sorry, im kinda keeping this one on the q.t.

CHANDLER:
 well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking.  

JOEY:
 

 hey!

JOEY:
 so i just talked to one of the dool writers today, and

MONICA:
 what is dool?

JOEY:
 days of our lives. anyway, youre not gonna believe it! my character is coming out of his coma!!

 oh!!

CHANDLER:
 thats great!

JOEY:
 and-and-and not only that, im gettin a new brain!!

CHANDLER:
 so great things are happening at work and in your personal life!

RACHEL:
 wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain?

JOEY:
 oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.

ROSS:
 what? a brain transplant?!

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 its ridiculous!

JOEY:
 well, i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months.

ROSS:
  street. 

MONICA:
 who are they killing off?

JOEY:
 uh cecilia monroe, she plays jessica lockhart. 

 noo!!

MONICA:
 shes my favorite character on dool.

JOEY:
 nice.

RACHEL:
 she is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, i mean i dont think ive ever seen her finish a beverage.

MONICA:
 and the way she slaps all the time!

RACHEL:
 oh!

MONICA:
 wouldnt you love to do it just once?!  

CHANDLER:
 dont do it.

RACHEL:
 cecilia monroe man, what a great actress.

JOEY:
 oh, tell me about it. and shes been on the show forever, its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.

ROSS:
 yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?

JOEY:
 yes, but in drake remorays body.  this so hard for you to get? i thought you were a scientist! opening credits 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah? why?

RACHEL:
 well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.

PHOEBE:
 oh no not that guy there. that guy right there.  

RACHEL:
 oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.

PHOEBE:
  figure it out. 

RACHEL:
 all right, straight, and not subtle. 

PHOEBE:
 ohh, he left his cell phone.

RACHEL:
 oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.

PHOEBE:
 or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing.

RACHEL:
 what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love. i mean wouldn't that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.

PHOEBE:
 yeah that does sound great. i'm going to get the phone.  

RACHEL:
 what? wait! whywhy do you get the story?

PHOEBE:
 i don't know. i haven't been out on a date in so long.

RACHEL:
 phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

PHOEBE:
 that wasnt a date! that was, that was just friends getting together

RACHEL:
 okay. okay, see? i get the phone.

PHOEBE:
 no way! no way! you just broke with tag a week ago.

RACHEL:
 yeah!  again.

PHOEBE:
 nice try.

RACHEL:
 oh hey-hey wait! how do we fairly decide who gets the phone?

PHOEBE:
 i dont know.  

RACHEL:
 well umm, maybe we could uhh   

PHOEBE:
 ah-ha! too cocky! 

 im going to keep dating him mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!

 oh yes there is!

 what are you going to do? kill him? like you did with charles?!

 

 well, at least im not a murderer! 

  

 cut! 

JOEY:
 that was a great scene! and-and-and that slap looks so real! how do you do that?

 oh, just years of experience.

 

JOEY:
 oh anyway, i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are.

 youre not the fan whos dying are you?

JOEY:
 say what?

 im supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but thats not supposed to be until 

JOEY:
 no. no, im joey tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. i-im the guy in the coma!

 oh that was a real person?!

JOEY:
 an-an-anyway i-i just wanted to say that since im getting your brain when you leave the show, i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me

 i-i-im leaving the show?

JOEY:
 

 who told you that?

JOEY:
 oh uh, one of the writers.

 which one? was it bald or was it tall?

JOEY:
 umm

 yknow what? it doesnt matter! because it is not true!

JOEY:
 okay.

 and if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that ive been playing for 20 yearsill give you a tip! 

JOEY:
 ms. monroe  joey standing next to dina. they share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just  

RACHEL:
 no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone.

PHOEBE:
 or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.

RACHEL:
 i dont think so.

PHOEBE:
  be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.

RACHEL:
  mom.

PHOEBE:
 ohh, i lost my mom to suicide.

RACHEL:
 okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.

PHOEBE:
 did i use that already today? im sorry.

RACHEL:
 yes okay.  telling us anything.  hats a steak house!

PHOEBE:
 okay, a meat eater. fine, thats one for you.

RACHEL:
  on his speed dial.

PHOEBE:
 so you dont know thats barneys the store! that can be yknow his friends house, or a bar. who has barneys the store on their speed dial?

RACHEL:
   

MONICA:
 what is that?

CHANDLER:
 i think its the dying cat parade.

MONICA:
 it sounds like its coming from across the street.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "youre half scottish right?"

MONICA:
 nooo!!

CHANDLER:
 yes!!   commercial break  

MONICA:
 no, there is no way! it can not be ross!   unbelievable! why is your family scottish?!

CHANDLER:
 why is your family ross?!

MONICA:
 he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! its not even a song!

CHANDLER:
 if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang.  

RACHEL:
 hi pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 how are ya?

PHOEBE:
 good.

RACHEL:
 umm pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that i was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 and remember how i said i was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang i could just pick it up?

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

RACHEL:
 and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!

PHOEBE:
 ooh, now you lost me.

RACHEL:
 you stole the phone!

PHOEBE:
 no i didnt!

RACHEL:
 no? so youre saying that if i called it, it wouldnt ring?

PHOEBE:
 no.

RACHEL:
 umm, okay. but while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  does work! 

RACHEL:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 that is a different phone.

RACHEL:
 oh is it?!   yes hi, is rachel there?  

PHOEBE:
 that is damning evidence. 

RACHEL:
 oh my god! i bet thats him. my digital fairy tale is about to begin. i wonder how i should be? should i be uh    would you stop doing that?!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 phoebe! you cant do th

PHOEBE:
 

30? at-at my apartment. its umm, its umm 5 morton street, apartment 14, umm and then maybe yknow after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. 

RACHEL:
 you do know that i will be here when he comes over.

PHOEBE:
 oh? and how will you know what time to come over?

RACHEL:
 you just said it!

PHOEBE:
 oh. okay, well i-i was kinda hoping that i would justbe alone yknow to think about my mom and her suicide.

RACHEL:
 oh phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 what?! thats the first time today!

RACHEL:
 ohh!   

JOEY:
 so you like the nachos uh? myself im partial to

 

JOEY:
 see you in 2003. 

  the show. they dont know exactly when its going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and thats it.

JOEY:
 im so sorry. look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.

 yeah, thanks.

JOEY:
 no i mean it! i cant believe they would do this to you! and to your fans! i mean they are going to be devastated! heart broken! they love you so much!

 oh youre right. thank you! whats your name again?

JOEY:
 joey.

 joey, well thank you. that is so sweet. oh, excuse me.  

 it wasnt my decision!

  saying?

JOEY:
 uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i, that i came up to you before was because well, im really nervous about-about being you. yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. yknow? help me keep jessica alive. please?

 all right joey, i will help you. not because i-i owe it to this stupid show, but because i owe it to jessica.

JOEY:
 oh thats great! oh thank you so much!

 youre so welcome.

JOEY:
 hey! now, ive been watching some tapes, hows this?   "jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again! ever!!"

 is that supposed to be me?

JOEY:
 yeah.

 yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent.

JOEY:
  resume!  

CHANDLER:
 well, i feel like a snack!

MONICA:
 do you want some shortbread? eh thats scottish like you are.

CHANDLER:
 oh no thanks. i dont like any thing from my scottish heritage.

ROSS:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 well its just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. 

ROSS:
 oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots.

MONICA:
 no! no-no theyre not. theyre still very angry! but yknow chandler is also half-swedish. you know what the swedish people are famous for? sitting down and being quiet.

ROSS:
 well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 how did you know about that?!

CHANDLER:
 we heard you play all the way from your apartment!

ROSS:
 were you the ones called the cops?!

CHANDLER:
 thats not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.

ROSS:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 because we hate them.

ROSS:
 come on thats not fair! i mean you havent even heard me play!

CHANDLER:
 we have heard you play.

ROSS:
 no, youve heard my practice. okay? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and im not going to tell you what song im gonna play either. but uh, lets just say when its over ill bet there will be a we bit o celebration. 

 so, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. so, when jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. 

JOEY:
 okay!  all right!

 no, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! hes not finding it out for the first time! so, try it again.

JOEY:
 okay. okay. 

 right. hes not angry at the room either. try it again, he owns it! he owns the room. it is his. he owns, owns, owns, owns the room! he owns it!!  getting better.  dont know what im going to do! i mean, its been 20 years of my life.

JOEY:
 oh wellhey-hey! maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. yknow? itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. youre so talented.

 i am. i am, but i dont know you know. an actor of a certain age is not that easy.

JOEY:
 hey thats not true! look at uh, look at angela lansbangelina jolie!

 i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but yknow i just got so comfy here! and ohh, i turned down some amazing work!

JOEY:
 like-like what?

 well, lets just say if i left 15 years ago, the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today!

JOEY:
 

 but well now, nows a different time for me.  

JOEY:
 oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? now when i watch you do a scene, im thinking, "boy, she-she is a great actress!"  also thinking, "she is hot!"

 

JOEY:
 you own the room.  should probably get-get uh

 oh yeah-yeah, we should get the  man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the mans face. 

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah, i noticed that! is that cause shes so passionate?

 no! its because that way the camera only sees her!   do you wanna try it?

JOEY:
 yeah! okay. 

 that was good, that was really good. but i-i think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like   commercial break  for his cell phone. rachel is putting on perfume by spraying it ahead of her face, and 

RACHEL:
 hey! hey!  

  

 hi! its tom, im here to pick up the phone. 

PHOEBE:
 whoa! why do you get to answer the door?

RACHEL:
 well why shouldnt i?!

PHOEBE:
 because its my apartment!

RACHEL:
 well, then i get to give him the cell phone.

PHOEBE:
 okay. all right.  calls to china. 

 hi!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 

 no thats my assistant.

RACHEL:
 is-is he coming? 

 umm, no.

PHOEBE:
 could you-could you umm, give us one second?

 sure!

RACHEL:
 well be right back sir.

 sure. 

PHOEBE:
 wh-what do we do?

RACHEL:
 i dont know!

PHOEBE:
 can you believe this?  a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!

RACHEL:
 i know! 

PHOEBE:
 hmm, they just dont make em like that anymore!

RACHEL:
  wait.

PHOEBE:
 rachel, listeni mean, if you let me have him then i will really owe you one.

RACHEL:
  him, but you owe me; you owe me big!

PHOEBE:
 yeah! youre such a great friend!

RACHEL:
 ohh

 so, which one of you lovely ladies am i going to take to dinner huh?

PHOEBE:
 oh thatd be me. sir. 

 okay. okay. 

PHOEBE:
   

 well, you certainly own that room.

JOEY:
 actually i rent the whole place and, i just got what you meant. thank you. 

RACHEL:
 hi.

JOEY:
 hey! 

RACHEL:
 oh my god! oh my god!! ohh, jessica lockhart!! in my apartment!! i am such a huge fan! i am such a huge fan!

 well, its nice to know that you

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 that uh, that is my roommate rachel.

 oh that explains all the womens underwear.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
  amazing! oh my god, can i just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?

 certainly.

MONICA:
 would you slap me? would you slap me right here in the face?!  

 id love to, but my lawyer said i cant do that anymore.

RACHEL:
 god. you seem really, really nice.

JOEY:
 okay, bye-bye.

RACHEL:
 i mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.

JOEY:
 all right, here we go.  

RACHEL:
 okay.

MONICA:
   umm, youre a stupid bitch.

 i really cant slap you. 

RACHEL:
 you are so beautiful.

MONICA:
 nice to meet you! my god youre great!

JOEY:
 thanks for stopping by. see ya!   i-i am so sorry. i

 oh no-no-no-no, being adored. im used to it, dont worry about it.

JOEY:
 

 what?

JOEY:
 they sent me todays script! they never send the script!

 they dont?

JOEY:
 well no, im just in a coma. this must mean i have lines!   oh

 how does it happen?

JOEY:
  electric fence.

 ah what?! jessica hates horses!

JOEY:
 yeah well, im guessing after this shes not going to be crazy about electricity either.  hear ross perform his interpretation of celebration by cool and the gang on 

ROSS:
 now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.

RACHEL:
  socks.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 no!

ROSS:
   

ROSS:
 one, two, three, four!  so even the best bag pipe players in the world would have trouble with that particular song. so of course, for a beginner like ross, it sounds absolutely dreadful. the assembled 

ROSS:
 you know the song! sing along!  with ross. while phoebe is singing along, rachel is having a very difficult time keeping a 

ROSS:
 so? 

 no!   

 loosening the saddle on mothers horse was brilliant fredrick. and the electric fence, inspired.

 thank you sweetheart. 

 i cant believe shes really gone. look around you, all of this is ours.  

JOEY:
 

 who are you?!

 whats the matter dina? dont you recognize your own  

 cut! that was great everybody! thank you!

  that youre a better jessica than i ever was!

JOEY:
 oh noo

 well of course not, but you were very good.

JOEY:
 thanks!

 and guess what? good news! i got another job!

JOEY:
 great! hey! all right! well-well what is it?!

 a film in guadalajara!

JOEY:
 the airport?

 no thats la guardia. 

JOEY:
 ohh. wow! well how-how, how will you be gone?

 eight months.

 really? like how?

RACHEL:
 well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal.

 

RACHEL:
 yeah? you like that one?

 yeah, youre funny.

RACHEL:
 im funny? oh thank god! well hey, ive got a ton of these! umm, oh heardo you want a good one? heres a good one. umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. right?  to person, i bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. and then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.

 can i do it to you?

RACHEL:

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
  in-intend on telling me about this?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 wait chandler come on, letsits not a big deal!

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 okay, maybe they are not funny to you

 

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 uh, yknow what? ill tell you who it hurts! it hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!

RACHEL:
 that was you?! we heard about you in junior high! did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "i will be revenged?!"

ROSS:
 i will be! listen, i dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. okay?

RACHEL:
 fine. fine, but ill have you know that once i taught him that stuff he called me fun aunt rachel. and i loved being fun aunt rachel but ill go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel if thats what you want!

ROSS:
 no thats not what i want. uh, im glad you guys were bonding but i

RACHEL:
 look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff! and i havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!

 

RACHEL:
 i gotta go!   

JOEY:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey. do you want this scone?  it would probably rather sleep with you!

JOEY:
 chandler, come on nothing even happened!

CHANDLER:
 look joe, i know you wanted to do the wedding

JOEY:
 no-hey-no! if you dont want me to do it, i except that. i dont care about that. i justi dont want you to be upset.

CHANDLER:
 how can i not be upset? okay? i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!

JOEY:
 yeah for like a half an hour one night! chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! youre so lucky! look what i missed out on by not being there! although you know what? it could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys are perfect for each other. yknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it justit-it fits. yknow? and you just know its gonna last forever.

CHANDLER:
 thats what you should say.

JOEY:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 when youre marrying us; thats what you should say.

JOEY:
 really? i can do it?

CHANDLER:
 id love it if you would do it.

JOEY:
 hey! 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.

JOEY:
 obviously! so, how do we decide?

ROSS:

JOEY:
  her.

ROSS:
 thats interesting, but check this out. i date her

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah i like that but just to go in another direction

ROSS:
 okay, okay. this can go on for a while.

JOEY:
 yeah well we should order some food then.

ROSS:
 no joey! look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? okay? hey-hey, well each go out with her one more time. and-and well see who she likes best.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 maybe ill take her to that new french restaurant down the street

JOEY:
 ah yeahwait a second now! look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. i dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.

ROSS:
 well sorry, thats what i do on dates.

JOEY:
 all right, well i guess ill just have to do what i do on dates.

ROSS:
 so lets decide on the spending limit

JOEY:
 yeah. uh, 

ROSS:
 i was thinking more like a hundred.

JOEY:
 okay. can i borrow 94 dollars?  

MONICA:
 oh

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 

ROSS:

JOEY:
 i just wanted to come by and yknow, wish you good luck on your date.

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 we have 8:00 reservations at grammercy bistero.

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 oh. well good!  this? did you give yourself a facial?

ROSS:

JOEY:
 okay dude! 

ROSS:
 thats right.

JOEY:
 you spent a hundred dollars. thats the limit. youre screwed!

ROSS:
 uh actually, i sent the flowers before the actual date. so techincally, technically i didnt break any rules. thanks for stopping by though.

JOEY:
 oh-oh! so thats the way its gonna be huh? yeah i can break the rules too yknow!

ROSS:
 oh yeah? what are you gonna do?

JOEY:
 i dont know.

ROSS:
 why am i not surprised?

JOEY:

JOEY:
 well well see!

ROSS:
 bye-bye!

JOEY:

ROSS:
 yes. yes. just here  there   

CHANDLER:
 joey got meat sauce on the banister again!  

PHOEBE:
 yeah, swing music is so out.

MONICA:
 phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 well umm, we were just talking about the yknow, the swing kings and just wondering whether yknow, they were the right way to go.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. and now im not saying that theres any connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced.

CHANDLER:
 but i love swing music!

PHOEBE:
 yeah but the swing kings? yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsthey just stop living.

CHANDLER:
 look all i know is when monica and i went to see them, we had fun! and theres another reason too.

RACHEL:
 well, what is the other reason?

CHANDLER:
 i dont want to say.

RACHEL:
 well you have to because maybe its stupid.

CHANDLER:
 well its just while monica and i were dancing to them it wasthe first time i knew thatyou were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with.

MONICA:
 oh crap!  

ROSS:
 so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.

 oh great!

ROSS:
 yeah.

 is your back feeling better?

ROSS:
 oh yeah its fine. i guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.

JOEY:
 

 joey!

JOEY:
 hi!

 hi! what are you doing here?

JOEY:
 oh i like this place. and technically, technically im not breaking any rules so i

 well uh, ross? this is joey. joey? ross.

JOEY:
 hi!

ROSS:
 hi.  friend named joey. i dont anymore.

 our table will be ready in a couple minutes.

ROSS:
 yeah. so

JOEY:
 sure! i would love to wait with you guys! thanks! 

ROSS:
 so joey umm, you look familiar. are uh, are you on tv or something?

 well joey doesnt like to talk about it but, hes one of the stars of days of our lives.

ROSS:
 thats right! thats right, dont you play a woman?

JOEY:
 a woman in a mans body.

ROSS:
 much better.

JOEY:
 so yknow ross its funny cause, you look familiar to me too. have you ever been married?

ROSS:
 well yes, yes i have. in fact umm, just the other day kristen and i were talking about how ive been married and how i have a son.

 yeah, little eric.

ROSS:
 thats right! wait no, ben.

JOEY:
 so youve just married the one time then?

ROSS:
 well umm

 youve been married twice?

ROSS:
 yes. and another time after that. boy im getting hungry! hey joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?

 you said the waiter ate my crab cake.

JOEY:
  marriage breakup? was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?

 do you two know each other? 

 no. no.

JOEY:
 no. it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. 

ROSS:
 wait a minute! were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

JOEY:
 have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!

ROSS:
 hey you leave marcel out of this!

JOEY:
 fine! have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!

ROSS:
 hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a tv cabinet vd boy?!

JOEY:
 monkey lover! 

JOEY:
 when do you think we lost her?

ROSS:
 probably around gonorrhea. 

CHANDLER:
 hi, honey! im home!

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 no! we only mess around at his place!

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 yeah but im not keeping it.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, thats like the most ugliest dress ive ever seen. wh-why do you to return it?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 oh thats great! great! thanks! but that dress i mean its like yuck! its terrible! it makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!

MONICA:

ROSS:
 and it was ernst muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the velociraptor would expand its collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten its predator. 

 what kinda noise?

ROSS:
 just a high pitched intimidating noise.

 but like how?

ROSS:
 well we-we dont know for sure. but in my head it-it sounded something like this.   of course, this is just conjecture. okay, thats uh, thats all for today. 

 yes sir.

ROSS:
 mr. morse i need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, im afraid i-i had to fail you.

 

ROSS:
 well you need 60% to pass

 whatd i get?

ROSS:

ROSS:
 no-no its not. what-what happened there ned?

 well maybe you can cut me some slack. im sort of in love.

ROSS:
 well im sorry but, that-thats really not my problem.

 im in love with you.

ROSS:
 well that brings me in the loop a little.

 you see, thats why i did so bad on this test. im having a hard time concentrating. when youre up there  teaching and your face gets all seriousyou look so good.  that tight little turtleneck sweater

ROSS:
 okay!  sorry, youre-youre a student and i-and i like women. in spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.  

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! that guy at the counter is totally checking you out!

MONICA:
 really? 

PHOEBE:
 go for it.

MONICA:
 phoebe, im engaged!

PHOEBE:
 im just saying, get his number just in case. but no chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill. 

 

MONICA:
 op, can i just tell you something? very flattered but umm, im engaged.  

 wow! uh, this is kind of embarrassing. i was actually coming over to talk to your friend.

MONICA:
 well you should be embarrassed.  

 

PHOEBE:
 i did, but that was really fun. 

JOEY:
  then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a  oh wow! i honestly never expected this. i uh, i didnt prepare a speech. but umm, id like to thank  parents, whove always been there for me. id also like to thank my friends, chandler, monica, phoebe, rachel

RACHEL:
 im fourth!  syrup award!

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 yeah.

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 well of course i do! but yknow, favorite returning character is a tough category joey. i mean youre up against the guy who survived his own cremation.

JOEY:
 yeah. no-no i-i know i might not win, but its justive never even been nominated before! i want it so much.

RACHEL:
 well joey, youll probably get it. but you should probably your-your gracious loser face. yknow when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. yknow? so its sorta like 

JOEY:
 hey! 

RACHEL:
 yknow?

JOEY:
 you practice losing the grammies too?

RACHEL:
 oh no, at the grammies i always win.

JOEY:
 ah. 

PHOEBE:
 oh hey!

MONICA:
 hey! howd your date go with jake?

PHOEBE:
 oh, great! we couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. 

MONICA:
 okay, stop it phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.

PHOEBE:
  me? is he gonna kiss me?"

MONICA:
 and did he?

PHOEBE:
 im a lady monica, i dont kiss and tell. but this hickey speaks for itself. 

MONICA:
 okay-okay, i got it. i got it.

PHOEBE:
 i just like him so much that i just feel like ive had 10 drinks today and ive only had six.

MONICA:
 oh, i havent had that feeling since i first started going out with chandler. wow, im never gonna have that feeling again am i?

PHOEBE:
 you sound like a guy.

MONICA:
 no, a guy would be saying, "im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." oh my god! im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! ive been so busy planning the wedding that i forgot about all the things that id be giving up! i mean, iim never gonna have a first kiss again.

PHOEBE:
 youll have a last kiss. 

ROSS:
 can i ask you something? have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?

JOEY:
 is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

ROSS:
 theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.

JOEY:
 whoa!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 ross has a boyfriend.

ROSS:
 i do-i do not have a boyfriend. theres a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.

RACHEL:
 really?

ROSS:
 yeah! i dont know. i mean, last year elizabeth now-now this kid. what-what-what-what is it?! am i giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe?  

RACHEL:
 not right now.

ROSS:
 it-itthe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.

RACHEL:
 oh, see now i feel bad for the kid! i had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! yknow youi couldnt concentrate and i blushed every time he looked at me. i mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in love.

ROSS:
 yeah. i guess i can cut him some slack.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 howd you get over that teacher?

RACHEL:
 i didnt. i got under him.

JOEY:
   

 bye phoebe.

PHOEBE:
 okay bye. 

 all right. bye. 

PHOEBE:
 bye!  at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.

MONICA:
 phoebe, its okay. you dont have to tip toe around me. i-ive been thinking about it and umm, yknow what? im okay about not having that new relationship feeling

 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 see? thats what i mean. i mean that, thats great! but i wouldnt trade in what i have for that. i mean im gonna be with chandler for the rest of my life, and thats what makes me happy.  sweetie, come here! come sit down. hey phoebe and i were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. it really is dont you think?

CHANDLER:

 all right, ive never been engaged and ive never really been married, but i can only tell you what my mother told me. whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.

MONICA:
 so im not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy im gonna spend the rest of my life with?

PHOEBE:
 that is correct! yes, youre supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.

MONICA:
 your mother told you this?

PHOEBE:
 yes!

MONICA:
 the woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! youre right! go!  chandler! hurry before its too late! wait no!  putting out doesnt get you love?

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 youre wrong! the centerpieces are fine! do you ever get scared at all?

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never gonna be with anybody new again?

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 just, i love you so much. justits just sometimes it bothers me that im never gonna have that feeling. yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting? yknow that rush?

CHANDLER:
 no. no, see when i first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.

MONICA:
 okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else?

CHANDLER:
 sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and im afraid even more sweating.

MONICA:
 even with me?

CHANDLER:
 i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  together for the rest of our lives.

MONICA:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 well yeah! but now that i know that youre having these thoughts, im back to panic, anxiety, and uh im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 well, no not yet. but the audition went really good.

MONICA:
 what was it for?

JOEY:
 oh, its this big budget period movie about these three italian brothers who come to america around the turn of the century. its really classy! oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next martin scorcese.

PHOEBE:
 the next, next?

JOEY:
 yeah, theres this guy from chicago whos supposed to be the next martin scorcese, all right? but then this guys right after him.   hello!

 joey! its estelle! i just talked to the casting people; they loved you!

JOEY:
 

 yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.

JOEY:
 

 theres just one thing. do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?

JOEY:
 are you kidding me? i never rent a movie without it!  

PHOEBE:
 whats the matter?

JOEY:
 they want me to be totally naked in the movie!

MONICA:
 wow!

JOEY:
 i know! my grandmothers gonna see this!

PHOEBE:
 grandmas gonna have to get in line. opening credits   monica is folding her laundry with ross reading the paper and phoebe 

PHOEBE:
 hey the wedding is so close! are you getting nervous?

MONICA:
 yeah. but a part of me also cant wait til its over. chandler and i have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.

ROSS:
 a no sex pact huh? i actually have one of those going on with every woman in america.

MONICA:
 hey phoebe, will you give me a hand? 

PHOEBE:
 sure.

MONICA:
 i gotta make up the guest bedroom.  coming to stay with us a few days.

ROSS:
 cassie?

MONICA:
 uh-hmm.

ROSS:
 wow, i havent seen her for like forever. i wonder if she still carries that barbie everywhere she goes.

MONICA:
 ross, shes 25 years old.

ROSS:
 so what! i still haveno youre probably right.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey pheebs, can i talk to you over here for a second?

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 subtle guys!

PHOEBE:
 what?!

MONICA:
 i know youre planning my surprise bridal shower.

RACHEL:
  least!

MONICA:
 okay. sorry. 

RACHEL:
  

MONICA:
 hey! what did you decide to do about the movie?

JOEY:
 i dont know! its not like its porn! this is a serious, legitimate movie. yknow? and the nudity is really important to the story.

MONICA:
 thats what you say about porn.

JOEY:
 youre right. maybe i shouldnt even go on the call back.

MONICA:
 no! no you should! a lot of major actors do nude scenes! i mean the chance to star in a movie? come on!

JOEY:
 well thats true. and i am only naked in one scene. plus it sounds really great. my characters catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl. who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. its really sweet and-and tender.

MONICA:
 plus, everyones gonna see your thing.  

PHOEBE:
 well when can we have this shower?

RACHEL:
 she has got so much going on we-we have only two options. we have friday

PHOEBE:
 well thats only two days away. what is the other option?

RACHEL:
 yesterday!

PHOEBE:
 well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! were done!

RACHEL:
 oh my god phoebe, this is impossible! we cant do this by friday! we have to find a place. we have to invite people! we have to get food! theres just too much to do! its impossible! we cant do it! we cannot do it! we cannot do it!

PHOEBE:
 rachel, calm down!

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 phoebe, i already, i already did.

PHOEBE:
 oh okay. all right, then i need to calm down a little.

RACHEL:
 okay. okay.  organized. all right? we have two days to plan this party. we just need to make fast decisions! okay? all right, where are we gonna have it?

PHOEBE:
 uh, here. what time?

RACHEL:
 4 oclock. food?

PHOEBE:
 finger sandwiches and tea.

RACHEL:
 ooh great! very monica.

PHOEBE:
 and chili!

RACHEL:
 ah you went one too far. uh, flowers or balloons?

PHOEBE:
 both!

RACHEL:
 were paying for this yknow.

PHOEBE:
 neither.

RACHEL:
 okay. umm, what should we do for the theme?

PHOEBE:
 lusts of the flesh.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 i dont know.   

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 yknow im-im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.

MONICA:
 oh boy me too!

CHANDLER:
 yknow i was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours

MONICA:
 yeah?

CHANDLER:
 technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering?!

MONICA:
 the wedding is off, sloppy and immature!

CHANDLER:
 thats me! come on!

MONICA:
 okay.  wait, we cant. my cousin cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.

CHANDLER:
 well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.

MONICA:
 shrill?! the wedding is back on!  denise richards is playing cassie. woo hoo! for those of you who dont know who she is, rent wild things and she was also the last bond girl in the world is 

 i thought i heard voices. you must be chandler.

CHANDLER:
 

 nice to meet you too.

MONICA:
 so, are you ready to go?

 yeah.  with a barry white song in the background. chandler needless to say cant help but 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 ill be right with you. 

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 whatwhy?

MONICA:
 because purvry perverson over here cant stop staring at her.

ROSS:
 what?! chandler shes our cousin!

CHANDLER:
 i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. its called being a good conversationalist. watch.  say something.

MONICA:
 you were staring about eight inches south of there.

ROSS:
 fine, she can stay at my place. by the way, what-what does cassie even look like now.

MONICA:
 she looks exactly like aunt marilyn.

CHANDLER:
 umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?

MONICA:
 wafer thin ice! 

JOEY:
 hey, im back!

 hi-hi joey.

JOEY:
 uh so, will-will i be reading the same scene again?

 actually, i tried to call to you. you didnt need to come down here today.

JOEY:
 oh great! yknow i wouldve been perfect for this part, but whatever! yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! good day! 

 wait joey! you didnt need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.

JOEY:
 and scene! huh? wasnt that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah! okay! so you-you-you-you were saying?

 well, the director thinks youre really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.

JOEY:
 wow! sure! thats great!

 oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah sure, just long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.

 terrific! well uh, theres one more thing. uhh, uh its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish. so 

JOEY:
 sowhat?

 so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not jewish. do you know what im saying?

JOEY:
 yes!

 okay.

JOEY:
 no. what?

 an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be

JOEY:
 barmifsaed?   

MONICA:
 so to get this part you cant be?

JOEY:
 nope.

MONICA:
 but you are?

JOEY:
 yep.

MONICA:
 but you told them you werent?

JOEY:
 thats right.

MONICA:
 wow! wow! and its definitely all gone? theres nothing there to work with? 

JOEY:
 i dont know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can! and just figure out how to do it later.

MONICA:
 joey! this is not like learning to ride a horse! this is like learning togrow a turtleneck!

JOEY:
 i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.

MONICA:
 oh my god, what are you gonna do?!

JOEY:
 i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part.  

MONICA:
 unless!

JOEY:
 unless what?

MONICA:
 well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.

JOEY:
 like what?

MONICA:
 well im not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat. 

PHOEBE:
 hey! ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone.

RACHEL:
 okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list.

PHOEBE:
 okay. okay! well okay, who do we know thats coming? me. are you?

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey! whats up mon?

MONICA:
 well uh, im trying to make something for joey. do you mind if i raid your fridge?

RACHEL:
 have at it.

MONICA:
 okay.  cheese?  wont work.

RACHEL:
 are you makin him a sandwich?

MONICA:
 no its umm, more like a wrap. okay so uh, im gonna go guys.  

 okay.

MONICA:
 i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 okay but look! look at what i got! its her address book!   we have a guest list!

RACHEL:
 oh my god youre amazing! did you just pull that out of her purse?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.  

ROSS:
 

 hey ross!

ROSS:
 hey!

  up your tent in line to see return of the jedi.

ROSS:
 oh. oh, thats right. so-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didnt.

 ah yeah, sorry about that.

ROSS:
 its okay. come, come on in.

 thanks for letting me stay here! i mean monicas place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.

ROSS:
 oh.  her hair around in slow motion with the love doctor barry white singing in the background. and id also like to take this opportunity to mention that she can also be seen in starship troopers and that she was born in downers grove, illinois which just happens to be a 

 oh my god! you do a great chandler!

ROSS:
 uh-huh. yeah i-i have a knack for impressions.

 well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.

ROSS:
 yeahno!! commercial break  

ROSS:
 cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.

 im all done.

ROSS:
 

 i guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.

ROSS:
 oh right. right. ooh, remember the time i uh, i pinned you down and tickled you til you cried? 

 ill always remember that summer, because its when i got all of these freckles. 

ROSS:
  always remember that summer because thats when i realized that we are related.

 it took you that long to figure it out, huh?

ROSS:
 well im, im a little slow.  would be.  

PHOEBE:
 hi!

 hi!

PHOEBE:
 how are you?   hi, thanks for coming.

 oh thank you. 

PHOEBE:

 no. 

 no thanks.

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

RACHEL:
 yeah?

PHOEBE:
 who the hell are all these people?

RACHEL:
 well, i dont know. i called all the people in monicas phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.

PHOEBE:
 hmm, yknow theres another word for people like that. losers! 

RACHEL:
  honor. how do you know monica?

 i was her accountant four years ago.

RACHEL:
 ohhhh!

 im very interested to find out whos been doing her taxes these last four years.

RACHEL:
 thats great!

 so, what time is monica supposed to get here? 

 

RACHEL:
  didnt tell her to come?!

PHOEBE:
 you were supposed to tell her!

RACHEL:
 no i wasnt! you were supposed to tell her to come and i was supposed to bring the cake!

PHOEBE:
 fine, ill go call her.

RACHEL:
 yes! and please tell her to bring a cake!  

MONICA:
 okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.

JOEY:
 wow! this looks great!

MONICA:
 yeah! okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  made of bologna. 

JOEY:
 and-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?

MONICA:
 oh, just until the glue dries.

JOEY:
 thank god!

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 ah.

MONICA:
 okay?  nice. but umm, if it gets wet then you know its gonna shrink.

JOEY:
 well maybe we just take that one away. 

MONICA:
 i also, did a little something in fur. but umm, thats really just for me.  try these on and well seeget a better idea of whats gonna work.

JOEY:
 thanks, you are such a good friend. and this is so weird.

ROSS:
  she knew what was going on in your head shed think you were sick!   or would she? lets back up a second. she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. she was the one who turned down the lights. she was the one that wanted to rent logans run, the sexiest movie ever.   oh, i know that look. forget it. i want it. she wants it. im going in.    

 hey! what the hell are you doing?! 

ROSS:
  have to be clever, it just has to be words. say some words.  do.  there is nothing you can say to make this worse!! so just say something!!   i-i, i uh havent had sex in a very long time.   yeah, you really shouldnt have said anything.  

MONICA:
 phoebe! rachel! its monica! i wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!   oh.

RACHEL:
 oh monica, we are so sorry.

MONICA:
 for what?

RACHEL:
 well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.

PHOEBE:
 and then for forgetting to invite you to it.

MONICA:
 you al-you already had it?

PHOEBE:
 yeah. well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.

RACHEL:
 yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.

PHOEBE:
 we ruined everything.

RACHEL:
 ugh

MONICA:
 well no wait a minute thats not true! no, what did, that was really sweet. and it kinda works out for the best.

RACHEL:

 oh, its not just that, i would be englands most powerful weapon. jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. a man who fears no one; with a license to kill.   

JOEY:
 we should really learn how to play the real way. 

PHOEBE:
 i like our way. oh!   chess!

JOEY:
 nice move.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 so joey i just hooked ross and chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?

JOEY:
 no, im performing the ceremony. im not wearing a tux.

RACHEL:
 well, what are you going to wear?

JOEY:
 multi-colored robes! ooh, and maybe a hat.

RACHEL:
 huh. does monica know about this?

JOEY:
 i dont think so.

RACHEL:
 can i please be there when you tell her? 

PHOEBE:
 hey oh, rach wait! do you want to go to a movie tonight?

RACHEL:
 oh, yknow what? i cant. i have to have dinner with that melissa girl.

JOEY:
  noise from my video camera.

PHOEBE:
 what is this? whats going on?

JOEY:
 oh good! can i tell her?! can i tell her?!

RACHEL:
 well, do you want to hear what actually happened or joeys lewd version?

PHOEBE:
 joeys!

JOEY:
 okay

RACHEL:
 hey, come on! i had this friend from college and i made the stupid mistake of telling joey that one timeshe and i yknowkissed a little bit.

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 it-it did!

PHOEBE:
 sure!

JOEY:
 hey. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, it was senior year in college. it was after the sigma chi luau and melissa and i got very drunk! and we ended up kissing! for several minutes! 

PHOEBE:
  cheek.

JOEY:
 why are you taking this away from me?

RACHEL:
 yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!

PHOEBE:
 okay! i justi didnt know that you are a lesbian.  

RACHEL:
 im not saying that im a lesbian! im just saying that this happened!

PHOEBE:
 okay, it just seems pretty wild and youre soyknow sovanilla.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 im not vanilla! ive done lots of crazy things! i mean i got-i got drunk and married in vegas!

PHOEBE:
 to ross.

RACHEL:
 all right, yknow what? if you dont want to believe me about this, why dont you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.

PHOEBE:
 okay! all right! yeah! cause i just cant picture it.

JOEY:
 oh-ho, you should get inside my head.  

ROSS:
 hey! guess what i got for your wedding! 

CHANDLER:
 a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?

ROSS:
 no. rachel hooked me up with a tux! but not just any tux, batmans tux!

CHANDLER:
 what?

ROSS:
 thats right! made expressly for val kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat batman film he was in.

CHANDLER:
 you cant wear that! im wearing the famous tux! james bonds tux!

ROSS:
 so?

CHANDLER:
 soif you wear that youll make mine less special.

ROSS:
 well, you need something to make this day special? hello! you-you-you have the most special thing of all! you are marrying the woman you love. 

CHANDLER:
 please, dont take away my cool thing. please?! pretty please?!

ROSS:
 pretty please? not very uh, 007.

CHANDLER:
 look, its my wedding day okay? if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you.

ROSS:
 when i got married you slept with my sister.

CHANDLER:
 that was pretty 007.  

JOEY:
 hey.

MONICA:
 hey. oh good-good youre here! all right, i figured it out. im gonna take two tables of eight, im gonna add your parents, and im gonna turn them into three tables of six. okay? and i called the caterer; i added two extra meals, we are good to go!

JOEY:
 yeah, theyre not coming.

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. theyfeel a little unwanted.

MONICA:
 oh thats too bad. its true, but too bad.

JOEY:
 look mon, if you could just call my mom

MONICA:
 oh joey!

JOEY:
 come on! look just-just telllet her know that you really want them to be there. lets not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.

MONICA:
 no she hasnt.

JOEY:
 is it her fault that some of them didnt make it to you?

MONICA:
 well, what am i going to say?

JOEY:
 i dont know. just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the invitations, orno-no-no! blame it on the post office. they hate the post office. and the irish! but i dont think you can blame it on them so  

MONICA:
  is monica geller.  really hope you can make it to the wedding. yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent werent delivered. umm, i guess there was some screw up at the damn post office!  us post office? no, more like us lost office!   

 anyway, his name is allan and weve been going out for three years. he was my first client when i became a party planner. he was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. oh well.  beta pi at syracuse.

RACHEL:
 oh. oh, thats great!

 hmm phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?

PHOEBE:
 of course! yeah, i was uh, umm thigh mega tampon.

 what one?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! yknow, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when regina philange died of alcohol poisoning.

 oh, isnt a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? 

RACHEL:
  tellin phoebe about that one crazy night after the sigma chi luau where you and i uh, we made out.

 

RACHEL:
 remember?! wecome on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops

 yeah?

RACHEL:
 we went back the house and we got really silly and wewe made out.

 oh wow, ray-ray i have no idea what youre talking about.

PHOEBE:
 really?! commercial break 

CHANDLER:
 ross is batman!

MONICA:
 well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.

CHANDLER:
 rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman. okay batman is so much cooler than james bond!

MONICA:
 what are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!

CHANDLER:
 batman has a utility belt!

MONICA:
 007 has a fancy car!

CHANDLER:
 batman has the batmobile!

MONICA:
 007 gets all the ladies.

CHANDLER:
 batman has robin! 

MONICA:
 how about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and ill make you a nice martini.

CHANDLER:
 actually, i dont like martinis.

MONICA:
 how about a youhoo with a funny straw?

CHANDLER:
 ooh, yum! 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 hey.

JOEY:
 listen, i know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?

MONICA:
 the show?!

JOEY:
 right. right. the wedding, gotcha. but i mean, its gonna start a little late right? i mean, weddings start late. right?

MONICA:
 have you ever been to one of my weddings?

JOEY:
 ah. yeah. well look, the thing is its the same day as my nieces christening and i really want my parents to be there in time to see me. cause my parts just in the beginning im not even in the rest of the showwedding!

MONICA:
 the wedding starts at six.

JOEY:
 okay. okay, i totally hear ya. oo how about this? i vamp a little til they get there?

MONICA:
 youll vamp?!

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah yknow, like warm up the crowd. ask em where theyre from. cause in joey tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. im a minis-tainer!  greater! 

RACHEL:
 how can you not remember us kissing?!

 i dont know. i dont remember a lot of things that never happened.

RACHEL:
 wh come on! remember? we were on the sleeping porch! we couldnt stop giggling? and our coconuts kept knockin together?

PHOEBE:
 oh, somewhere joeys head is exploding.

RACHEL:
 yeahbut come onlisten, im sorry i dont want to make you uncomfortable, but i told phoebe that it happened and she doesnt believe me.

 im sorry ray-ray. i mean if i thought it happened i would say it. maybe i passed out and you did stuff to me while i was sleeping.

RACHEL:
 no!!

PHOEBE:
 rachel, its okay. you dont have to do this. i believe you. all right? okay, if-if you say that you kissed melissa, then you kissed melissa.

RACHEL:
 thank you phoebe.

 she didnt.

PHOEBE:
 i know.  

ROSS:
 hey!

MONICA:
 you just carry that around?

ROSS:
 yes. i find it to be something of a conversation piece. 

MONICA:
 between you and

ROSS:
 gunther.  get a picture of batman and james bond together.

CHANDLER:
 i would but mine doesnt fit. the pants are a little tight.

MONICA:
 a little tight? i could see double-oh and seven in those pants.

ROSS:
 well that stinks. i was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.

CHANDLER:
 well, does that mean that youre not going to wearing yours?

ROSS:
 what are you kidding? its batmans tux!!

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 okay, but just the jacket. double-oh and seven are not gettin in there.

CHANDLER:
   whats this?

ROSS:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 an invitation for the at first sight premiere? oh my god! val kilmer didnt wear this in batman! he wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!

ROSS:
 let me see that! 

CHANDLER:
 the only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 all right thats it, i give up! whatever you want you can have it! you wanna sing a song? you wanna do a dance? you want your mom stand at the alter and scream racial slurs? i dont care!

JOEY:
 no! no, i-i just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. theyre so happy they get to be a part of your special day.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 well, youre welcome. and tell them were really glad theyre coming.

JOEY:
 okay. i will. ohh! check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!  when i marry you guys, and then this  time. 

RACHEL:
 it happened! i am telling you it happened!

 okay.  dont think ill be calling you  youve gotten weird.  

RACHEL:
 what?! wait a minute! no wait a minute!  night was the one wild thing i have ever done in my entire life, and im not gonna let you take that away from me! okay, so if you dont remember that, maybe you will remember this! 

 my god! you love me!

RACHEL:
 

 of course i remember our kiss. i think about it all the time. i can still hear the coconuts knockin together i  didnt want to tell you cause i didnt think that youd return my love, and now that you have 

RACHEL:
 

 aww, look whos being suddenly shy. you cant tell me you dont feel what i feel. nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. 

RACHEL:
 

 

RACHEL:
 im sorry!

  imim obviously kidding. im not in love with you.  im not in love with her. i dont hear coconuts banging together. yeah, i dontpicture your face when i make love to my boyfriend. anyway, i gotta go. ehkiss good-bye?  

RACHEL:
 wow! i mean i had no idea that that was gonna 

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 i dont want to say.

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on! i dont care! come on! whose is it?

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 theres still so much to do. have you written your vows yet?

CHANDLER:
 i figured id buy those. pat, id like to buy a vow. 

MONICA:
 sweetie, you know i have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.

CHANDLER:
 right. so uh, have you written yours yet?

MONICA:
 no! but i know exactly what im going to say.

CHANDLER:
 do you happen to know what im going to say?

MONICA:
  okay? it wont be hard. just say whats in your heart.  

CHANDLER:
  more than i love her! whats wrong with me? ooh, dont open that door. opening credits  

CHANDLER:
  are no words! this should not be this hard!

JOEY:
 all right, uh  well what did you say when you made up your vows?

ROSS:
 well with carol, i promised never to love another woman until the day i die. she made no such promise.

CHANDLER:
 im so pathetic! monica knows what she wants to say! you shouldve seen her. writing, writing, writing!  

RACHEL:
 monica what? 

PHOEBE:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 what is the emergency?!

MONICA:
 you have to help me! im supposed to be writing my vows and all i have is this! 

RACHEL:
 well, i like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.

MONICA:
 thank you.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. 

MONICA:
 those are my eyes! those are my breasts. 

PHOEBE:
 oh! yeah!  

ROSS:
 well, why dont you just start with something simple. like umm, monica from the moment i met you, i knew i loved you.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, im not sure i can do that.  

ROSS:
 ...everyone, this is chandler!

 hi, i'm ross's little sister.

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:
 okay. okay. okay. umm, maybe you can start with, "chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew i wanted more."  

CHANDLER:
 all right, theres a nuclear holocaust, im the last man on earth. would you go out with me?

MONICA:
 ennnh.  

MONICA:
 ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!

PHOEBE:
 well maybe you dont talk about your feelings back then. maybe you just say something about yknow all the things that hes taught you. like  taught him.  woman on. they're in monica and rachel's apartment and monica has just drawn a diagram of 

MONICA:
 now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.   you got one, two three, four  , five, six, and seven!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 its kind of an important one!

CHANDLER:
 oh, yknow-yknow what, i was looking at it upside down.

RACHEL:
 well, yknow, sometimes that helps.  

MONICA:
 all right. umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  6-7, 7 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7  

JOEY:
 oh, i got it! how about saying something like, "monica

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 "when i look back over our time together"

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 well, i cant do everything! look back over your time together.   

PHOEBE:
 oh, look, twins. hi, guys. oh, cute, cute.

MONICA:
 no fair. i don't even have one. how come they get two?

CHANDLER:
 you'll get one.

MONICA:
 oh yeah? when?

CHANDLER:
 all right. i'll tell you what. when we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?

MONICA:
 why won't i be married when i'm 40?

CHANDLER:
 oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.

MONICA:
 ok, hypothetically, why won't i be married when i'm 40?

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no.

MONICA:
 what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 well?

CHANDLER:
 dear god! this parachute is a knapsack!      

ROSS:
  today!! ahh, whoo-hoo!! 

MONICA:
   do you think he knew i was here?    

CHANDLER:
 nice try.

MONICA:
 wait, wait, wait! 

CHANDLER:
 look, monica

MONICA:
 look! 

CHANDLER:
 this is not going to work.

MONICA:
 i bet this will work! 

CHANDLER:
 you are so great! i love you! 

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 nothing! i said, i said "you're so great" and then i just, i just stopped talking!

MONICA:
 you said you loved me! i can't believe this!

CHANDLER:
 no i didn't!

MONICA:
 yes, you did!

CHANDLER:
 no i didn't!

MONICA:
 you love me!

CHANDLER:
 no i don't! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!    

CHANDLER:
  yknow i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here?

MONICA:
 then all your stuff would be here.

CHANDLER:
 well, what if all my stuff was here?

MONICA:
 then youd be going back and forth all the time, i mean it doesnt make any sense.

CHANDLER:
 okay. what if we lived together and you understand what im saying?    

MONICA:
 you wanted it to be a surprise. 

CHANDLER:
 oh my god. 

MONICA:
 chandler in all my life i never thought i would be so lucky.  reason why girls dont do this!

CHANDLER:
 okay!  i thought  thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you,   trying to make you feel the same way.  marry me?

MONICA:
 yes.  

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 come in! come in!  were engaged!!!  commercial break 

JOEY:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey, what have you guys been up to?

ROSS:
 oh, we were helping chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.

JOEY:
 how is "monica, i love your sweet ass," inappropriate?

ROSS:
 hows monica coming along with her vows?

PHOEBE:
 well lets just say its shes lucky she has a sweet ass, cause shes not so good at the writing.

ROSS:
 i cant believe in four weeks theyre gonna be married!

PHOEBE:
 well lets just hope it works. yknow nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?

ROSS:
 phoebe thats not true.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, youre right. hows the mrs.?

RACHEL:
 i cant believe theyve been together for three years.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.   

JOEY:
 hey, it's me! i'm comin' in!  

CHANDLER:
 i've had a very long, hard day.

JOEY:
 ahh, i'm gonna go get some chicken. want some?

CHANDLER:
 ahh, no thanks. no chicken, bye-bye then.

JOEY:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 are you okay? i'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. he kept asking me about chicken.

MONICA:
 chicken? i could eat some chicken.

CHANDLER:
 hey joe! 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, can i get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a coke diet coke.  

RACHEL:
 i dont know why they didnt just tell us.

JOEY:
 i know! i mean its not like we werent cool about it.  keep his new found knowledge of their secret relationship in monicas bedroom in the 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 yes, but you cannot tell anyone! no one knows!

JOEY:
 how?! when?!

CHANDLER:
 it happened in london.

JOEY:
 in london!!! 

CHANDLER:
 the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

JOEY:
 but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!  

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no-no-no! you can't!

MONICA:
 please? please?! we just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? just promise you won't tell. 

JOEY:
 all right! man, this is unbelievable!  

MONICA:
  gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 arghh!!

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 nothing! oh god, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!

ROSS:
 actually, it looks really good.  

PHOEBE:
      

PHOEBE:
 okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that rachel knows?

JOEY:
 yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!

PHOEBE:
 or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own  

RACHEL:
 all right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.

MONICA:
 bye!

 bye!

PHOEBE:
 bye chandler!  

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 joey!

JOEY:
 they know you know.

RACHEL:
 ugh, i knew it! oh i cannot believe those two!

PHOEBE:
 god, they thought they can mess with us! they're trying to mess with us?! they don't know that we know they know we know!  you can't say anything!

JOEY:
 i couldn't even if i wanted too.  

CHANDLER:
 listen, this is totally getting out of hand! okay? she wants me to put lotion on her! 

MONICA:
 she's bluffing!

CHANDLER:
 look, she's not backing down! she went like this!   

PHOEBE:
 he's not backing down. he went to get lotion.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner phoebe breaks chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.

JOEY:
 ooh!

RACHEL:
 okay!

JOEY:
 i like that!  can't work 'em! 

PHOEBE:
 joey! 

JOEY:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 ooh.

CHANDLER:
 well, i guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 okay! okay! okay! you win! you win!! i can't have sex with ya!

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.

RACHEL:
 you really think it would be that different?

PHOEBE:
 how could it not be? i mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. and then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a volvo dealership.

RACHEL:
 well, things change.

JOEY:
 i dont want them to move to a volvo dealership!

ROSS:
 itll be okay joe.

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 nice work everybody! so much for the yknow, "you can drive it, but dont tell rachel" plan!

RACHEL:
 wow! i cant believe you lied to me.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i can fix this! okay monica, rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. 

MONICA:
 great! well rachel, the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver. there! that wasnt about the wedding.

ROSS:
 look rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the porsche ill be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.

JOEY:
 yeah, you got a couple hours? opening credits  

ROSS:
 whew! that was a brisk ride!

RACHEL:
 take the top down did ya?

ROSS:
 only way to fly. 

RACHEL:
 come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what shes talking about! i am an excellent driver!

ROSS:
 youre fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver.

RACHEL:
 well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader. 

ROSS:
 did you see the look that girl just gave me? huh? she mustve seen me cruising in the bad boy.

RACHEL:
 i think shes checking out your beehive ross.

ROSS:
 what?! 

RACHEL:
 gimme the keys!

ROSS:
 no way!

RACHEL:
 well no brush!

ROSS:
 fine! yknow what? it doesnt matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.   

RACHEL:
   

MONICA:
 chandler, we still havent gotten an rsvp from your dad.

CHANDLER:
 oh! right. umm, maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation.

MONICA:
 chandler! hes your father; he should be at the wedding.

CHANDLER:
 i dont even know the man. okay? were not the close. i havent seen him in years.

MONICA:
 well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!

CHANDLER:
 well he doesnt have to know! its not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, i think i wanna trade circles.

CHANDLER:
 trust me, you dont want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.

MONICA:
 so what! as long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil i dont care.

PHOEBE:
 okay, i think i need to do some shopping.  

RACHEL:
 ahhh!  

RACHEL:
 my god!

ROSS:
 what do you think youre doing?!

RACHEL:
 just washing the windshield.  

ROSS:
 there is no way i am letting you drive this car! so why dont you just hand over the keys?

RACHEL:
 oh.

 she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? its a tradition left over from porsches racing history. the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday.  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. the drivers left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}

ROSS:
 no ah-ah-ah! do not start this car!  okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!  

RACHEL:
 look ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car!

ROSS:
 with you?! yeah right!

RACHEL:
 all right. 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 what are you doing?! get in the front!

ROSS:
 in the death seat?!!

RACHEL:
 oh my  

 hey guys!

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey sweetie!

 ready to go?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! sure! ooh, i left my purse up at monicas. ill be right back. 

 

PHOEBE:
 what?  

JOEY:
 so! you and phoebe huh? how long have you been going out?

 over a month.

JOEY:
 wow! maybe uh, maybe you and i ought to get to know each other a little better.

 sure, id like that.

JOEY:
 so uh, whats your name?

 

JOEY:
 joey. 

 yeah, big fan.

JOEY:
 me too! theres a game on tuesday do you wanna go?

 yeah that would be great! let me make sure im not doing anything tuesday.    

MONICA:
 here! 

CHANDLER:
 whats this?

MONICA:
 its your suitcase. were going to las vegas.

CHANDLER:
 are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! no more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersthink of the money well save!!  wedding be bigger please?

MONICA:
 were going to las vegas to see your dad. its time you two talked, and i want to get to know my father-in-law.

CHANDLER:
 yknow we already went over this and i won!

MONICA:
 no you didnt. oh and honey just so you know, now that youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore.

CHANDLER:
 look forget it okay? i dont want to go. i dont want to see him. i dont wanna.

MONICA:
 chandler, look i-i know that your dad embarrassed you. i know

CHANDLER:
 no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. youre skinny. youre wearing speedoesthat your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!

MONICA:
 hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! okay? thats a, thats a pretty great dad.

CHANDLER:
 he had sex with mr. girabaldi!

MONICA:
 whos mr. girabaldi?

CHANDLER:
 does it matter?!

MONICA:
 chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe its time that you let that stuff go. if your fathers not at your weddingyoure gonna regret it for the rest of your life.

CHANDLER:
 yeah o-okay, but im just doing this for you.

MONICA:
 yes!

CHANDLER:
 so i really never get to win anymore?

MONICA:
 how much did ever really win before? 

JOEY:
 pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

JOEY:
 listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear?

PHOEBE:
 yeah!

JOEY:
 well, when jake did it i saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!

PHOEBE:
 i know. they were mine.

JOEY:
 oh. 

PHOEBE:
 no, its not! we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on.

JOEY:
 thats weird!

PHOEBE:
 im wearing his briefs right now.

JOEY:
 thatskinda hot.

PHOEBE:
 i think so too. and that little flap? great for holding my lipstick.

JOEY:
 yeah, i wouldnt know about that.

PHOEBE:
 and! yknow what jake says? that womens underwear is actually more comfortable. and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.

JOEY:
 yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!

PHOEBE:
 there is nothing wrong with jake! okay? he is all man! im thinking even more than you.

JOEY:
 oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.

PHOEBE:
 im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! i dont think you could ever do that.

JOEY:
 hey! i am secure with my masculinity.

PHOEBE:
 okay whatever.

JOEY:
 youve seen my huge stack of porn right?   

RACHEL:
 god. i forgot how much i love driving. i have got to get my license renewed.

ROSS:
  licenseokay that is it! pull over right now!

RACHEL:
 oh ross youre so tense! you just gotta relax okay? just need to relax all right? just need to relax 

ROSS:
  thats not funny! just stop horsing around!

RACHEL:
 i am not horsing around okay? i am porsching around. 

RACHEL:
 uh-oh. 

ROSS:
 okay, stay calm. nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.

RACHEL:
 really? you think so?

ROSS:
 i was talking to myself! youre going down!  past a pile of rachels laundry, which just happens to include a selection of panties. he stops, goes back to the basket, looks for rachel, picks up a lavender thong, and heads for his bedroom. however, he decides he doesnt like his selection and goes back this time picking up a red low-cut silk brief and heads for his room, flexing along   arrive at 4 queens bar, where chandler and monica are sitting at a table waiting for the show to start.

 

MONICA:
 uh oh yeah, she did. uh, he did.  im-im sorry im new. i dont

 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i just ordered a beer! 

 youre straight. i get it. 

MONICA:
 i still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.

CHANDLER:
 no! no! i dont want him to know were yet! im not sure im ready for that. and besides hes not gonna be too happy to see me either.

MONICA:
 why not?!

CHANDLER:
 i dont know if ive told you this, but hes kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years

MONICA:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to new york, but i always said i was too busy to see him. yknow its all very cats in the cradlei dont want to get into it.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! chandler just left though!

RACHEL:
 yeah but, maybe its not what we think. maybe its tell monica im sorry idrank the last of the milk.

PHOEBE:
 or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? tell monica im sorry.

ROSS:
 i think it means he freaked out and left!

PHOEBE:
 dont be so negative! good god! isnt it possible that sorry is sitting in there

MONICA:
  

RACHEL:
 god! dontwe cant let her start getting ready! this is too awful! oh god, but wait shell be in the gown and then he wont show up and then shes gonna have to take off the gown

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 im sorry. im sorry. its justits just so sad!

PHOEBE:
 oh heres a whole bunch.

RACHEL:
 oh, i mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "oh that poor girl." yknow? then shell have to come back here and live all alone.

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 there was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. monicas pregnant.  alone. commercial break 

RACHEL:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 i know! monicas gonna have a baby! hey, can this count as her something new?

RACHEL:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 hey, do you think this is why chandler took off?

RACHEL:
 no, she had to have just taken that test because i took out the trash last night.

PHOEBE:
 oh god, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! the bride is pregnant. the groom is missing. and im still holding this.  

RACHEL:
 okay phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.

PHOEBE:
 right.

RACHEL:
 okay?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, okay. hey, wait. do you know what kind of birth control she was using?

RACHEL:
 no. why?

PHOEBE:
 just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.  

RACHEL:
 anything?

ROSS:
 no! i talked to joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. i-i-i talked to chandlers parents again!

PHOEBE:
 you told them he was missing?

ROSS:
 no! i made it seem like i was just calling to chat. pretty sure, they both think im interested in them.

RACHEL:
 all right, weve got to tell her hes gone. 

ROSS:
 no! hey! hey! we cant!

RACHEL:
 ross, shes gonna start getting ready soon!

ROSS:
 well, cant you at least stall her a little? ill-ill go back to some of the places i went last night.

RACHEL:
 all right, well how much time do you need?

ROSS:
 well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?

RACHEL:
 one hour.

ROSS:
 give me two.

RACHEL:
 then why do you ask?! 

ROSS:
 okay, wish me luck.

PHOEBE:
 okay. im going with you.

ROSS:
 why?!

PHOEBE:
 ross, youre tired. youve been looking all night. and clearly you suck at this.

RACHEL:
 all right, ill see you guys later.

PHOEBE:
 okay. wait, do you know how youre going to stall her?

RACHEL:
 ill figure something out.

PHOEBE:
 all right. good luck.

RACHEL:
 thanks. 

MONICA:
 hey! okay, so i thought wed start with my make up and then do my hair.

RACHEL:
 okay uh, but before you do that. i-i, i need you to talk to me.

MONICA:
 about what?

RACHEL:
 umm im never gonna getting married!

MONICA:
 yeah you will! the right guy is just around the corner! okay, are we done with that?

RACHEL:
 no monica! im serious! oh, maybe i should just forget about it. become a lesbian or something.

MONICA:
 any woman would be lucky to have ya.

RACHEL:
 well maybe it would make me feel better if i slept with joey.

MONICA:
  

JOEY:
 excuse me, aaron?  problem with the schedules. originally, i wasnt supposed to work today, and i have this wedding that i really have to be at. its my best friends, and im officiating so i really cant work past four.

 joey, you gotta stay until the end. we cant stop filming just for you. its not like its your wedding. 

JOEY:
 im having surgery!

 what?!

JOEY:
 yeah, i-i just made up the stuff about the wedding because i didnt want you to worry about me. but, im having surgery today.

 what kind of surgery?!

JOEY:
 transplant.

 but youre supposed to work on monday.

JOEY:
 hair transplant.

 but youre not bald.

JOEY:
 its not on my head.

 look joey, theres nothing i can do. besides, youre probably gonna be out by four anyway. weve just got one short scene. its just you and richard, and god knows hes a pro. youll be fine.   morning richard.

JOEY:
 hey! youre here! great! great! great! lets get going buddy, weve got a scene to shoot!

 im wearing two belts.

JOEY:
 are you drunk?

 no!

JOEY:
 yes you are!

 all right. 

ROSS:
 we are never gonna find him! hes one guy in a huge city!

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! is that him? 

ROSS:
 that is an old, chinese woman!

PHOEBE:
 he could be in disguise, yknow.

ROSS:
 aw, yknowyknow, maybe were-were just approaching this all wrong. if youre chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on earth people would think youd go? 

ROSS:
 so this is your office?

CHANDLER:
 how did you guys find me? i knew i shouldve hid at the gym!

PHOEBE:
 what the hell are you doing?!

CHANDLER:
 panicking! and using the internet to try to prove that im related to monica. how is she?

ROSS:
 shes fine. she doesnt know youre gone. and she doesnt have to know, okay? now come on, were going home.

CHANDLER:
 no! no! no! i cant do that!

PHOEBE:
 why not?!

CHANDLER:
 because if i go home, were gonna become the bings! i cant be the bings!

ROSS:
 whats wrong with being the bings?

CHANDLER:
 the bings have horrible marriages! they yell. they fight. and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!

ROSS:
 chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?

CHANDLER:
 no.

ROSS:
 then you are neither of your parents!

CHANDLER:
 its not just their marriage! i mean, look at yours. look at everybodys! the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman! and ive met me; i am not paul newman. i dont race cars! i dont make popcorn! none of my proceeds go to charity.

PHOEBE:
 but look chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than i do. but i totally believe you can do this.

CHANDLER:
 i want to. i love her so much, but im afrits too huge.

ROSS:
 yknow, okay. youre right. it is huge. so why dont we take it just a little bit at a time? okay? umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. can you just come home and take a shower?

CHANDLER:
 well yeah, but then

ROSS:
  home and take a shower. now, thats not scary right?

CHANDLER:
 depends on what you mean by we. 

RACHEL:
 the nights are the hardest.  and thats every bit as hard as the night. and then the night comes again

MONICA:
  rachel im sorry! i have to start getting ready! im getting married today!

RACHEL:
 i know. at dusk. thats such a hard time for me.

MONICA:
  hotel in an hour! 

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 okay. all right.  about to tell you, i need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 how can that be?! oh wait! wait! are you, are you serious?!

PHOEBE:
  on it, yknow make sure we dont lose it again

RACHEL:
 oh!

MONICA:
 oh wow! okay. dont scare me like that okay? i mean for a minute there i was like, "oh my god! the worst has happened!"    

JOEY:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

 you cant ask us son, thats cheating.

ROSS:
 

 well, he better not come by here. he cant see the bride in the wedding dress.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 go on! go on. 

MONICA:
 chandler, for so long ii wondered if i would ever find my prince, my soul mate. then three years ago, at another wedding i turned to a friend for comfort. and in stead, i found everything that id ever been looking for my whole life. and nowhere we arewith our future before usand i only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. unless you dont want to. you go!

JOEY:
 chandler? 

CHANDLER:
  thought this was going to be the most difficult thing i ever gonna had to do. but when i saw you walking down that aisle i realized how simple it was. i love you. any surprises that come our way its okay, because i will always love you. you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with. you wanna know if im sure?  

JOEY:
 you may not kiss the bride. so, i guess by the powers vested in my by the state of new york and the internet guys, i now pronounce you husband and wife. oh wait! do you take each other?

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way   hello. 

JOEY:
 chandler. will you see if your mom can give my resume to dennis phillips? cause if i can get in a broadway show then i wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater. the only think left would be radio, and thats just for ugly people.

CHANDLER:
 what size shoes do you wear?

JOEY:
 uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

CHANDLER:
 great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can i borrow the boots from your costume?

JOEY:
 uh, i dont even really know where i left those. sorry.

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 okay fine! im a seven! all right, i have surprisingly small feet. but the rest of me is good, ill show ya! 

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh yknow what honey? lets not talk about that right now?

MONICA:
 this is so huge.

RACHEL:
 sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?

MONICA:
 of course not nothing is. between me and you

RACHEL:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

RACHEL:
 hey! yknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything theyre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!

MONICA:
 how?

RACHEL:
 i dont know! maybe they have tools.

MONICA:
 well i-i talked to and uh, shes definitely going to have this baby. yknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.

RACHEL:
 well, maybe thats, maybe thats really brave.

MONICA:
 maybe. i just hope she realizes how hard its gonna be.

RACHEL:
 maybe she hasnt really thought it through that well.

MONICA:
 well, theres a lot to think about. i mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? how is she going to juggle work? does she realize shes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 are you okay?

RACHEL:
 uh-hmm. im just thinking about phoebe; poor knocked up phoebe.

 champagne?

RACHEL:
 oh yes! thank you very much!  realizes what she just did. she then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass  oh thats-thats actually how the french drink it.  commercial break 

PHOEBE:
 well, i just got off the phone with my lover, james brolin

MONICA:
 oh really?!

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 how do you feel?

RACHEL:
 i dont know. i dont know how i feel. this is all happening so fast. i have to make all these decisions that i dont want to make.   somebody just take this away from me!!

PHOEBE:
 calm down. maybe youre not pregnant.

RACHEL:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 when i got pregnant with the triplets, i took that test like three times just to make sure.

MONICA:
 yes! maybe its a false positive. are you sure you peed on the stick right?

RACHEL:
 how many ways are there to do that?

PHOEBE:
 im-im just saying, dont freak out until youre a hundred percent sure.

RACHEL:
 all right, ill-ill take it again when i get home.

MONICA:
 you-you gotta take it now. come on, do it as a present to me.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

ROSS:
 oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if i could do you a favor, and my uncle murray came up to you and handed you a check. and then you said, "why do they call it a check? why not a yugoslavian?"  that.

MONICA:
 oh wow! okay. well that was fun.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 okay.

MONICA:
 whew. although yknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. i mean i guess yknow it may just count as a half a present. what do you think?

PHOEBE:
 well i guess its okay to open one more if its part of a set. yknow, its probably this one. 

MONICA:
 or this one! 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 hey, how are you feelin? any morning sickness?

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 yeah thats right chandler does still think im pregnant. he hasnt asked me how im feeling or offered to carry my bags. boy, i feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. 

RACHEL:
 dont worry i promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, cause im going to tell the father today.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, is it someone in this building? is it that tall guy from the first floor?

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 wow. yknow it is so weird. i mean, youre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whats gonna happen.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. youre just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. youre like ed mcmahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

RACHEL:
 yeah. uh-huh, i guess it is pretty big news.

PHOEBE:
 pretty big? its huge! god, this guy doesnt have a clue! hes just walking down the street thinking, i had sex with rachel green. i rock! then bam! hes a father and everythings different.

RACHEL:
 well its only different if he wants it to be. i mean, im not gonna ask him for anything.

PHOEBE:
 okay. then he still has this huge decision to make. now hes walking around thinking, do i want to be a dad? and then bam!

MONICA:
 what was that bam?

PHOEBE:
 i dont. he gothe-he-he-hes hit by a bus.

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 yeah but how do i start? i mean, whats-whats the first thing that i say? 

MONICA:
 hey! good luck!

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
  didnt you tell me?! 

MONICA:
 i didnt think you could keep it a secret.

CHANDLER:
  secret keeper. i have kept all of our secrets.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 all in good time my love. all in good time. oh shoot! i left my guitar in their apartment. well you can let me in later.

JOEY:
 i dont have a key, they took mine to give to you.

PHOEBE:
 what?! they took mine to give to you!

JOEY:
 why would they take away our keys?

PHOEBE:
 maybe they dont trust us.

JOEY:
 no thats not it. they let me keep my key the last time they were out of town. 

PHOEBE:
 you mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with monicas guest towels?

JOEY:
 hey, i washed those!

PHOEBE:
 no you didnt.

JOEY:
 yeah that didnt sound like me.

PHOEBE:
 well, what am i gonna do? i really need my guitar!

JOEY:
 yeah, i have stuff in there too.

PHOEBE:
 what stuff?

JOEY:
 monicas chicken parm! ill take care of it.   hey mr. treeger, its joey tribbiani. listen, i need to get into monica and chandlers apartment. its an emergency.  bring garlic bread.

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 oh well, i guess ill catch up with her later.

PHOEBE:
 well, she really wanted to talk to you now.

JOEY:
 yeah, it seemed pretty important.

ROSS:
 oh no.

PHOEBE:
 what?

ROSS:
 i think i might know what this is about. 

JOEY:
 really?

ROSS:
 yeah. uh, uh we promised we werent gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago rachel and i slept together.

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 wow! i thought you would be a little more shocked.

PHOEBE:
 oh sorry. 

ROSS:
 well, we-we said wed just do it that one time but, but now i think she may wanna start things up again.

JOEY:
 yeah, i dont think thats what it is.

ROSS:
 why? what-what else could it be?

JOEY:
 oh wow, i dont feel well.

ROSS:
 im telling you. im telling you. thats what it is. no wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. she didnt say anything to you?

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 please, just-just, just go and talk to rachel.

ROSS:
 yeah, i guess i should.  realize? maybe im just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. yknow, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. i should remember that.    

 next? 

MONICA:
 theyre kissing lets just go around them.

CHANDLER:
 oh honey, leave them alone, theyre in love.

MONICA:
 im in love too! but in an orderly fashion.

 im sorry, all our first class seats are taken. that couple got the last two.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 25j and k, any chance those arent together?  

JOEY:
 i still cant believe they took away my key. you trust me with yours.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 what the hell is that?  

JOEY:
 whoa! whoa! whoa! treeger, what are you doing?

 you said there was a gas leak in here.

PHOEBE:
 well why dont you use your key?

 because by the time i find it on this thing  , the whole place might have exploded. if that happens at another building that i manage, people are gonna start asking questions.  come on! hurry up. 

PHOEBE:
 oh! we could have done that.  tiny hallway that proves this is a set on a sound stage and not an actual airport, and see 

MONICA:
 look at that! look at that! theyre going into the first class lounge! do you know what they have in there?

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 okay.  thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it?

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends?

RACHEL:
 seriously. what?!

ROSS:
 okay. okay. yknow what? if you want to, we can do it one more time. i mean id-id be okay with that. in fact, i have some time right now.

RACHEL:
 okay, yknow what? can i, can i talk now?

ROSS:
 oh sure. 

RACHEL:
   ross?   that commercial break 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 im good. im good.

RACHEL:
 ross, there is no pressure on you. okay? i mean you can as involved as you want. 

ROSS:
 yeah, i need uh im justi dont knowi dont understand, umm, how this happened? we-we used a condom.

RACHEL:
 i know. i know, but yknow condoms only work like 97% of the time.

ROSS:
 what? what? what?!! well they should put that on the box!!!

RACHEL:
 they do!

ROSS:
 no they dont!!!   well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!

RACHEL:
 okay ross come on lets just forget about the condoms.

ROSS:
 oh well i may as well have!

RACHEL:
 listen, yknow what? i was really freaked out too when i found out

ROSS:
 freaked out? hey no, im not freaked out! im indignant! as a consumer!

RACHEL:
 yknow what? lets, lets talk later.

ROSS:
 no! no! i want to talk now! okay? iin fact,  am going to talk to the president of the condom company!

RACHEL:
 okay, yknow maybe i should come back 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
    

 ive looked everywhere. theres no gas leak.

JOEY:
 

 anyway uh, ill get moving on that new door.

PHOEBE:
 oh great! and listen, could you do us a favor and not tell chandler and monica about this? cause yknow umm, they dont-they dont have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.

 well im gonna have to put on a new lock, theyll find out anyway.

PHOEBE:
 oh no.

  day job, ill have to cancel my yoga class. 

ROSS:
 hi.

ROSS:

 namaste. 

ROSS:
 namaste.  

ROSS:
 oh my god! what happened to the door?!

JOEY:

ROSS:
 look, is rachel here? i really need to talk to her.

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 yeah but uh okay, okay look you guys know that rachel and i slept together, but theres something else. 

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 with my child.

PHOEBE:
 that is brand new information!!

ROSS:
 you already know dont you?

PHOEBE:
 a little bit.

JOEY:
 how are you doing?

ROSS:
 okay. okay. i mean ill be okay. its just i dont think i handled it very well.

JOEY:
 well, what did you say to her?

ROSS:
 nothing. but the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. and then when i turned around she was gone.

PHOEBE:
 oh ross.

ROSS:
 but hey, in my defense i-i just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 i gotta go find her.

JOEY:
 whoa! hey! whoa!! hold up! are you serious?! so like 3% of the time they dont even work?! huh? they should put that on the box!

ROSS:
 evidently they do.

JOEY:
 what?!   

MONICA:
 i cant believe were here.

CHANDLER:
 oh youve got to be kidding me.

MONICA:
 what? 

 as a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.

MONICA:
 no!! you have been screwing us all day!

 who are you?

CHANDLER:
 were you just ten seconds later!

MONICA:
 yeah! you already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! i mean we should get free stuff too! i mean youre not the only ones on your honeymoon!

 well you can have the suite if you want. we dont care about where we stay. were here to celebrate our love together. we dont have to get free stuff. we just want to be together.

CHANDLER:
  

JOEY:
 hey monica its joey. listen uh, phoebe and i smell gas comin from your apartment.

MONICA:
 what? are you serious?! 

CHANDLER:
 what else is new?

JOEY:
 yeah and wed go check it out, but you took away our keys.

MONICA:
 well do something! get in there!

JOEY:
 how? i guess i could break down your door.

MONICA:
 yeah! do that!

JOEY:
 and-and you wont blame us for any damage?  

MONICA:
 no! 

JOEY:
 uh, okay ill-ill-ill break it down.  

PHOEBE:
 oh hey hi, hes doing it. hes breaking down the door.   okay, were in.   

 okay rachel, are you comfortable?

RACHEL:
 

 the doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.

RACHEL:
 okay.  barn 

ROSS:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 uh we-we need to talk.

RACHEL:
 uh-uh-uh, right now? because ive kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.

ROSS:
 please, please i want to apologize for the way i acted earlier today.

RACHEL:
 okay ross thats fine, but can you please stand near my head?

ROSS:
 what? oh yeah.  think i went a little crazy. i mean i was thinking about myself when i   reallyi should have been thinking about you rach

RACHEL:
 okay. head ross! head ross! head ross!

ROSS:
 right! right! i justi want you to know that im going to be there through this whole thing, okay? okay? the doctors appointments, the uh, the lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartmentalthough we could probably worry about that til after we get married.

RACHEL:
 what married?

ROSS:
 well yeah, i think we should get married.

RACHEL:
 what, because thats your answer to everything?

ROSS:
 no, because thats the right thing to do.

RACHEL:
 yeah, maybe if youre in love. but ross, we are not in love, are we?

ROSS:
 no butbut still you cant possibly do this alone.

RACHEL:
 excuse me?

ROSS:
 come on rach, you cant even eat alone in a restaurant.

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
 im just saying if you cant eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?

RACHEL:
 i can too eat by myself!

ROSS:
 when have you ever?

RACHEL:
 when certain people leave the table and i am not finished!

ROSS:
 well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!

RACHEL:
 oh please, you inhale your food!

ROSS:
 i grew up with monica! if you didnt eat fast you didnt eat!!

 

RACHEL:
 oh no dr. long, please come in. this is ross, he is the father.

ROSS:
 but not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.

 huh. nice to meet you. ill get started on this.

ROSS:
  admit that you need me.

RACHEL:
 i do need you! i need you to stand near my head!

 okay, everything looks good. here it is on the screen.   here is your uterus. and right here is your baby.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh. oh, its beautiful. i see it now.

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

JOEY:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 filming rachel is not something i planned. okay look, heres what happened, and joey you-you can back me up on this. all right, about-about a month and a half ago i came to you with a problem? umm, a personal thing. 

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:
 whoa, for like months?

ROSS:
 five to be lying, six.

JOEY:
 six months? whoa thats rough.

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 thank you.  no!

JOEY:
 youre right. 

ROSS:
 joey! no!

JOEY:
 loud and clear!    

MONICA:
 i still don't get why greg and jenny would give us a fake number.

JOEY:
 yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either.

MONICA:
 okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names.

JOEY:
 oh yeah? 

PHOEBE:
 regina philange. 

CHANDLER:
 i still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.

MONICA:
 i know! although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.

CHANDLER:
 i thought you said those jokes were funny. joke! joke! joke!

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 well maybe it was all of your questions.

MONICA:
 what about my questions?

CHANDLER:
 the sheer volume, it was like flying with the riddler!

MONICA:
 oh, im sorry. was that another joke?

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 uh no rach, hes gone. but listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.

RACHEL:
 oh really? well how would you like it if i had sex with you and i taped it?  my child, the porn king of the west village.

ROSS:
 look, it was accident! okay? i-i feel bad that it happened, but i swear, i didnt even watch it! anyway, here.  thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. 

RACHEL:
 thank you.   what?   you dont want to see this do you?

MONICA:
 hell yeah!!!

RACHEL:
 i am not gonna show you this!

PHOEBE:
 no! not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.

ROSS:
 forget it, shes destroying it.

PHOEBE:
 okay fine! fine! well just have to think of some other way to put the whole who came onto who, thing to rest! come on now, think!!

ROSS:
 look, forget it phoebe. okay? its rachels tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. and she wants to destroy it. so, end of story.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 i dont want people to see it for your sake.

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 rachel, please

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

 youre a joker bing. 

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 im telling you, i like the food!

CHANDLER:
 you like the purple rain display! 

 hey toby! have a good night. 

ROSS:
 did that guy just call you toby?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, he thinks thats my name.

ROSS:
 well, why dont you correct him?

CHANDLER:
 oh its been going on way to long now. yknow, i mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so i didnt say anything. and then the next time he said, "hey toby, do you want a donut?" and i-i wanted a donut. and now its five years later, the donuts gone and im still toby.

ROSS:
 five years?! chandler you have to tell him!

CHANDLER:
 no! that would be so awkward! lookbesides, we work in different departments. hes on the sixth floor yknow? so he calls me toby once in a while. whats the big deal? it could be worse, its not like hes calling me muriel. 

ROSS:
   oh my god! chandler m bing? its not just an m, your middle name is muriel!!

CHANDLER:
 shh! it is a family name!

ROSS:
 chandler muriel bing. boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?  

 drake, ive discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.

 what is it?

 apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. it seems your body is rejecting jessicas brain.

 is it serious?

 not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.

 well that sounds simple enough, lets just do that.

 we would, but when we went to exhume jessicas body, it was gone. 

 cut! very nice people!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 well dontwhat happened to jessicas body?!

JOEY:
 im not telling, youll have to see it on tv!

RACHEL:
 you dont know do you?

JOEY:
 no, couldnt care less.

 hey good scene man.

JOEY:
 hey you too!

 alright. 

JOEY:
 what? you werent in it.

RACHEL:
 oh! 

JOEY:
 oh sorry. uh-uh, kash?

 yes?

JOEY:
 this is my friend rachel. rachel, kash, kash, rachel.

RACHEL:
 hi.

 hey! how come i havent seen you here before?

RACHEL:
 well, joey probably thinks ill just embarrass him. yknow, he thinks im some kind of a soap opera nutwhich im not! im not. although i do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.   and uh, and that your-your dogs name is wally. well look at that, im just stroking your arm.

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
 oh, were leaving. bye kash.

 bye.

RACHEL:
 say hi to wally. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh monica!

MONICA:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! i had the best time with tim last night. he is so sweet! oh, i cant wait to get sous-neath him.

MONICA:
 ii have to fire him.

PHOEBE:
 but why?!

MONICA:
 because hes terrible! okay, hes slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!

PHOEBE:
 well maybe he was just nervous, yknow you can be very intimidating. and besides ive met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.

MONICA:
 well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.

PHOEBE:
 but monica, he loves his job so much! can you just give him another chance? please?

MONICA:
  is out of there!

PHOEBE:
 thats fair! thank you so much. thanks. oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.

MONICA:
 i paid to have this done.

PHOEBE:
 love it! 

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi!

JOEY:
 oh you know uh kash, really liked you the other day. he said he thought you were charming.

RACHEL:
 i thought i was a complete idiot.

JOEY:
 hey, im with you. he even asked me if i thought youd go out with him.

RACHEL:
 oh! oh, i think im gonna throw up a little bit. what did you say?

JOEY:
 i said no.

RACHEL:
 what?!

JOEY:
 what? ii just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people.

RACHEL:
 okay joey, first of all kash ford is not people. second of all, what did he say when you told him i was pregnant?

JOEY:
 i didnt tell him. i didnt know if you were telling people. this is back when i thought kash was still people.

RACHEL:
 good-good, dont tell him. dont tell him. just have him call me okay?

JOEY:
 rach look, i really dont think thats such a great

RACHEL:
 okay, you go do it! ill come back to that set! ill meet more actors! ill meet em all!  

CHANDLER:
 hey bob.

 hey! hows my pal toby doing today?

CHANDLER:
 if i see him, ill ask.

   

 hey-hey! bing? was that bob from six you were just talking too?

CHANDLER:
 yeah!

 oh then you know each other.

CHANDLER:
 were on a semi-first name basis.

 what do you think of adding him to our team?

CHANDLER:
 bob? ooh, working here with us? everyday? yeah, i dont know if he has what it takes.

 really? they love him down on six.

CHANDLER:
 but this is eleven. its almost twice as hard up here.

 okay, i hear you loud and clear. bob will stay put.

CHANDLER:
 i think its best sir.

 but we really do need to find someone up here. the work is starting to pile up. ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.   

CHANDLER:
 yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.

 

CHANDLER:
 what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! 

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey. okay, i gave him another chance, but tim has got to go!

PHOEBE:
 but

MONICA:
 no! no-no! he is totally incompetent. i called the chef who recommended him to me. he said, "ha-ha! gotcha!"

PHOEBE:
 okay. okay, but you cant fire him today.

MONICA:
 why not?!

PHOEBE:
 because im dumping him today.

MONICA:
 what?! you said he was sweet!

PHOEBE:
 he is sweet. hes too sweet. he calls me all the time.  out of the shower okay?"

MONICA:
 just dont pick up your phone.

PHOEBE:
 then he comes over!  you." uck! be a man!

MONICA:
 what? so now im not allowed to fire him?

PHOEBE:
 you cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.

MONICA:
 okay well then, ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.

PHOEBE:
 are you kidding?! another week with that sip, ill kill myself!

MONICA:
 okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!

PHOEBE:
 okay. but the question is whos gonna go first. cause whoever goes second is the bitch.

MONICA:
 what do you mean?

PHOEBE:
 come on! the boss that fires a guy thats just been dumped, bitch! and the woman who dumps a guy thats just been fired, blond bitch!

MONICA:
 i wanted to do this days ago so i think i should go first.

PHOEBE:
 all right, that makes sense.  butscrew you im going first!   

 hey toby, you got a sec?

CHANDLER:
 sure, whats up?

 i just had a meeting, i was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but i just found out its not gonna happen. apparently somebody thinks im not eleventh floor material. say uh, who the hell is this chandler?  

RACHEL:
 hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why im not drinking on this date tonight. "umm, im a recovering alcoholic. im a mormon," or "i got so hammered last night im still a little drunk?"

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 hi!

JOEY:

ROSS:
 so, what do you want to do tonight? theres a ukrainian film at the angelica thats supposed to be very powerful. interested?

JOEY:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh no, i cant. i got a date.

ROSS:
 a date?

RACHEL:
 yeah. why? is that weird for you?

ROSS:
 why no, its the opposite of weird. its-its uh, regular. its-its uh, its mundane. its actually uh, a little dull.

JOEY:
 its no ukrainian film.

RACHEL:
 yeahooh! earrings! 

ROSS:
 a date?! shes-shes got a date?! with who?

JOEY:
 i set her up with this actor on my show.

ROSS:
 you set her up?!

JOEY:
 no

ROSS:
 joey what-what were you thinking?!

JOEY:
 well, i was thinking that itd probably be okay because ross hasnt gone out with rachel in five years!

ROSS:
 joey, im not worried about her! im worried about my baby! whoever she dates my baby dates! now-now where is this  taking them?

JOEY:
 hey! im an  not sure. i think theyre taking the ferry out to some italian place on staten island.

ROSS:
 a ferry? my baby is going on a ferry? do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!

JOEY:
 are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?

ROSS:
 why dont they just jump out of an airplane?! huh?! that-thats a fun date! or burn each other with matches?! thats fun too! whew!! 

 hey joey.

JOEY:
 hey kash. uh hey-hey this is ross. ross, this is kash.

JOEY:
 well ross, what did you think she was gonna do?

ROSS:
 i dont know! i guess i just cant believe any of this is happening.

JOEY:
 what do you mean?

ROSS:
 its just i always thought when i had another kid it would be different. now i-i love ben, but every time i have to drop him off at carol and susans, its likeit breaks my heart a little. i mean ive always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. and we all read the paper together. yknow? maybe fight over the science section.

JOEY:
 thats a nice picture. maybe you can still have that!

ROSS:
 no! no i cant. i mean rachels out with some guy. my baby went with her. if anything that picture keeps moving further away.

JOEY:
 hey, can i ask you something? in this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife rachel?

ROSS:
 it used to be. now she doesnt really have a face. smokin body though.

JOEY:
 good call. yeah. but, the face ross, the face isnt rachel.

ROSS:
 no but ahh! how much easier would it be if it were?

JOEY:
 i know, but i dont think thats what she wants.

ROSS:
 no, its not what i want either. i mean i-i cant force myself to fall in love with her again now.

JOEY:
 thats okay ross maybe you need a new picture. okay? its not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what theres gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. who cares what the picture looks like?

ROSS:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 my mother killed herself.

 she, now i knew that andnow im sweating. look at me, im really sweatingnow im saying, "look at me," im getting even sweatier. i think i probably should go.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 why are you looking at me like that?

 cause the sweats getting in my eyes and its burning.

PHOEBE:
 

 oh umm, im the solar system.   yeah, my students helped me make iti teach the second grade.

PHOEBE:
 i love the second grade!

 really?

PHOEBE:

 so what do you do?

PHOEBE:
 umm, im a masseuseby day.  

 yknow you dont have to stand here with me, believe me

 two weeks ago.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 oh really?

 were both teachers.

PHOEBE:
 huh? 

 and we were both in the peace corps.

PHOEBE:
 peace corps, really? 

 in fact when we were building houses in uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.

CHANDLER:
 howdy doody.

ROSS:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 monica and i were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or ross?

CHANDLER:
 theres no question.

JOEY:
 so you think ross too? 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 ross is really strong! okay, hes the strongest out of all three of you! 

CHANDLER:
 i cannot believe you didnt pick me.

ROSS:
 uh, in her defense, shes right. i am stronger. i would destroy you.

CHANDLER:
 oh really?! you think youre stronger? why dont you prove it? 

ROSS:
 oh ill prove it! ill prove it like a theorem!!   

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
  its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! thats the kind of strength that i want in the man that i love!

CHANDLER:
 that means nothing to me.   

PHOEBE:
 hi liar!

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 yknow the only reason hes marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.

 well they could be true.

PHOEBE:
 but theyre not!

 yeah, its a fine line huh?

PHOEBE:
 why are you lying to him?

 i dont know. he said he did all this stuff and then i said i did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.

 

  disgusting habit and i want you to quit now!

 shes helped so many people to quit smoking.

 yknow, wed really better get going.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 umm listen, i dont thinki dont think im gonna make it to the wedding. so i just want to wish you all the luck in the world.

 i think well be okay. besides its so perfect and  shes been saving herself for me.

PHOEBE:
 okay i cant let you do this! shes lying to you.

 what?

PHOEBE:
 she is lying! and i bet i can prove it. excuse me.   okay. okay. yeahnot a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.  as a waitress! not a teacher, a waitress. all right, heres her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. how old did she say she was?

 she told me she was 25.

PHOEBE:
 oh, i almost dont want to show this.  remember im a minute younger.

 i am so stupid. of course she was lying! shes not a teacher. theres not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.

PHOEBE:
 no. youre not, youre not stupid.

 im not smart.  tobe impulsive once. to be romantic.

PHOEBE:
 thats good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. justyou did it with the wrong person. 

 its just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.

 

 id better go, deal

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you should. 

 hurry up i gotta pray!!  

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hey! well, i had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.

JOEY:
 thats not so bad.

RACHEL:
 no, i also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. oh, i am just awful with children!

JOEY:
 come on! youre good with kids. theyre just crazy on halloween. yknow, theyre all greedy and hopped up on sugar!

RACHEL:
 really? you think thats all it is? 

JOEY:

ROSS:
 thats not really porn.

RACHEL:
 not so much.

ROSS:
 hey, yknow what and if youre looking for a place? i just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! was she old? does she have a view?

ROSS:
 well i dont know, but how-how great would that be huh? you living in my building. i could help take care of the baby. i can come over whenever i want.   with your permission.

RACHEL:
 yeah that would really be great.

ROSS:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 well can we see it?! oh maybe we shouldnt. i mean if she just died this morning out of respect.

ROSS:
 yeah. no. no youre right.  

RACHEL:
 shall we?

ROSS:
 yeah.   

 yes?

ROSS:
 hi. im ross geller. i live in the building.

RACHEL:
 and im rachel, an admirer of the building.

ROSS:
 i-i heard about mrs. verhoeven passing away and im so sorry for your loss.

 she didnt pass.

ROSS:
 what?

 my mothers still alive.

ROSS:
 oh, thank god!

 it looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but shes a tough old bird.

RACHEL:
 ahh.

 are you close with her?

ROSS:
 of course! uh yeah, she and i would talk all the time in-in   the laundry room. 

 you speak dutch?  van mijn moeder te ontmoeten.  

ROSS:
 yknow i would its just painful.

RACHEL:
 so shes really not dead.

 no, shes hanging in there.

RACHEL:
 hmm. do you thinkcould you tell me if shes hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two? 

 mrs. bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! whered you get it?

MONICA:
 oh well umm, i make it myself! its two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. and now the secret ingredient isyknow what? we just met.

 okay. uhh, im gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. and, when i come back ill clean behind the refrigerator.

MONICA:
 

 ill be back in a minute.

MONICA:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 see? i told you.

MONICA:
 she stole my jeans!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 i have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!

CHANDLER:
 so she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?

MONICA:
 dont you see? its the perfect crime!

CHANDLER:
 she mustve been planning this for years!

MONICA:
 i will prove it to you! okay? about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain!

CHANDLER:
 honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?

MONICA:
 i guess.

CHANDLER:
 so, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we gosnooping around her crotch?

MONICA:
 fine. im just glad i didnt give her my secret ingredient.

CHANDLER:
 out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?

MONICA:
 yeah!  

PHOEBE:
 hi!

 come in, im so glad youre here.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, me too. not in the shaky angry way you are though.

 sorry, i just saw ursula. i had to give the engagement ring back.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

 just seeing her brought it all back. all the lies, the way she used me. i justi got so angry just looking at her

PHOEBE:
 yeah. 

 im sorry. i justwhen i look at you i see her. when i see her i get a little bit angry.

PHOEBE:
 maybe this is too weird.

 no wait! theres only a problem when i look at you.   oh i got it! i got it. 

PHOEBE:
 no dont tear out your eyes!!

 i was just, i was just gonna take out my lenses.

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah try that. 

 not really. youyoure blurry, but you still look like ursula. youre blursula. okay wait. maybeif i-if i just dont look at you for a while.  im not angry at all anymore! this is a great date!

PHOEBE:
 look eric, turn around.  shouldnt be this hard. yknow? this is our first date yknow? first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand? and yknow first kisses and second kisses.    

ROSS:
 thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, gunter.  

 jij spreekt nederlands? dat is te gek. heb je familie daar? 

ROSS:
 yeah, were done.

 ezel. 

ROSS:
 ezel? ezel? ezel? 

JOEY:
  tide pools?

ROSS:
 really?!

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 sweet!

JOEY:
 all right, well finish your coffee; lets go.

ROSS:
 okay i-i just have to stop by my place first.

JOEY:
 to tape the game? you do this every time ross, youre not gonna be on tv!

ROSS:
 no-no, i-i have to see if this apartment became available.

JOEY:
 oh, youre switching apartments?

ROSS:
 its not for me, its for rachel.

JOEY:
 but rachel has an apartment.

ROSS:
 yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.

JOEY:
 she is?

ROSS:
 yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?

JOEY:
 i guess i didnt really think about it.

ROSS:
  youre an ezel!

  jij hebt seks met ezels.  

ROSS:
 damnit!  

MONICA:
 nice jeans!

 oh thanks! i like your top.

MONICA:
 oh.   

 what happened?!

MONICA:
 oh, i fell asleep.

 i was thinking about taking my lunch break.

MONICA:
 oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? thatll really work up your appetite for lunch.

 all right.  clean the top of the cabinets. monica sneaks over, bends over, and tries to see the stain. that doesnt work so she sticks her head between brendas legs. suddenly brenda 

MONICA:
 hello.

 whats going on?!

MONICA:
 im sorry. ive never had a maid before, is this not okay? commercial break  

RACHEL:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 how was the game?

JOEY:
 oh, okay. ii ate way too much.

RACHEL:
 oh.

JOEY:
 ooh.  talkin to ross and he said you were looking for a new place.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! hopefully across the street if certain dutch people would just let go.

JOEY:
 i was kinda hoping youd stay.

RACHEL:
 oh but joey, i have to go. theres no room for a baby here.

JOEY:
 no room? its a baby. its like this big.   yknow, i mean you-you could you could put it over here.  or-or-or we could put it right here.  could put it over here.  wheres the baby? 

RACHEL:
 honey, its not just a matter of where you put it. i mean a baby changes everything. they cry all the time. i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when theres a screaming baby around.

JOEY:
 i could use a challenge! its getting pretty easy.

RACHEL:
 honey, its so sweet that you want me to stay, but i-i cant do that to you. i mean it would disrupt your entire life.

JOEY:
 i love living with you so much. i just wish things didnt have to change.

RACHEL:
 i know.

JOEY:
 yknow i blame ross for this.

RACHEL:
 i do too a little bit.

JOEY:
 im gonna miss you, youre the hottest roommate i ever had. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, oh no! i have to go! i have a massage appointment.

 oh no, stay here well keep doing this. ill pay you.

PHOEBE:
 no, i got in trouble for that before. ill see you later.

 absolutely.  kiss.

PHOEBE:
 really? thats the thing im worse at! youll see.   

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 hey! umm, i think brenda needs a raise.

CHANDLER:
 how come?

MONICA:
 because i put my head between her legs.

CHANDLER:
 to see her pants?

MONICA:
 theyre my pants!

CHANDLER:
 are you sure? did you see the stain?

MONICA:
 no! i was just getting into position and then everything went dark.

CHANDLER:
 god! she is not stealing from us! okay, will you let this go?

MONICA:
 fine.   shes wearing my bra!

CHANDLER:
 oh dear god!

MONICA:
 my pink flowered bra! i recognize the strap!

CHANDLER:
 and yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.

MONICA:
 heres the plan! okay? im going to leave you get a look at brendas bra!

CHANDLER:
 heres another planno!

MONICA:
 i would do it but she thinks im attracted to her!

CHANDLER:
 why?

MONICA:
 did you not hear where my head was? come on! come on were a team! were in this together!

CHANDLER:
 i fear a jury will see it the same way!

MONICA:
 do this for me! come on, i catch you looking at womans breasts all the time!

CHANDLER:
 you see that?

MONICA:
 do you see this? 

CHANDLER:
 all right. yes. okay. i get your point. but if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!

MONICA:
 yes! absolutely. okay? look, youll know its mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip.

CHANDLER:
 you need new clothes.  

ROSS:
 hi. how is she?

 its not looking good.

ROSS:
  bloemen. 

 thats so sweet.  like to come in and say good-bye? im sure it would mean a lot to her.

ROSS:
 oh i dont know that it would.

 well, her memory is pretty much gone.

ROSS:
 all right then.  

PHOEBE:
 

 welcome back!

PHOEBE:
 hey! 

 i dont know, im still pretty tired out from this afternoon.

PHOEBE:
 why?

 uh, the sex.

PHOEBE:
 what sex?

 our sex.

PHOEBE:
 we didnt have sex.

 well if i didnt have sex with you, i had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like

PHOEBE:
 

 

PHOEBE:
 you-youyou had sex with ursula?!

 uh, a little bit. she-she-she walked in and i thought she was you and i kissed her and

PHOEBE:
 you didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!

 well i was just so excited to see you.

PHOEBE:
 oh. ew! ew! ew! ugh! yknow what? this is too weird.

 no-no its not! i dont want to lose you! its-its like i was saying to ursula when i was making love to her and i thought she was youyeah it is too weird.

PHOEBE:
 so i guess this is it.

 yeah. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, so do you.  

 

CHANDLER:
 im leaning. this is where i lean.

 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 brenda a bee!

 what?

CHANDLER:
 yes! its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!

 i think i know whats going on here.

CHANDLER:
 you do?

 look, i know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. youre married.

CHANDLER:
 i totally understand.  bra? 

RACHEL:
 hi!

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 you gave them to me!

MONICA:
 no i didnt!

RACHEL:
 all right, i took them. but i figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.

MONICA:
 oh no! did you take my bra too?!

RACHEL:
 what bra?

MONICA:
 the pink one with the flowers?!

RACHEL:
 you mean the one that youre wearing?  

 

MONICA:
 sounds about right.  

RACHEL:
 what is this?

JOEY:
 hey! uh, this is just to give you an idea. okay well, we can put screens here,  over the crib. and uhoh look! heres a baby monitor  the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. huh?

RACHEL:
 youre so sweet.  you gave the baby hugsy! 

JOEY:
 ahhhhhhhhhhhh. that-that-thats really just to show where the baby would go. yknow why dont i hold on to him so that theres no confusion? 

RACHEL:
 but joey the baby is going to be crying, its going to be loud.

JOEY:
 im loud!

RACHEL:
 its gonna be up all night!

JOEY:
 im up all night!

RACHEL:
 its gonna poop!

JOEY:
 hello!

RACHEL:
 what about all the women you want to bring home?

JOEY:
 look, if im bringing home a woman who cant stand being around a baby, then maybe i dont want to be with that woman! or maybe well just do it in the bathroom of the club!

RACHEL:
 joey, are you sure?

JOEY:
 yeah! all rightlook, i know sometimes itll be hard, okay? but, itll also be reallyreally great. please rachel! i-i-i really want you to stay.

RACHEL:
 i want me to stay too.

JOEY:
 ohh!

RACHEL:
 thank you. 

JOEY:
 i know! i found it on the street.

RACHEL:
 are you seriousreally?! its in such good condition.

JOEY:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 wow! whoa-whoa whats under the covers?

JOEY:
 i dont know.

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 ew.

RACHEL:
 its still here! get it out of here!!

JOEY:
 ooh! ah! okay!  dedicated to the memory of pearl harmon closing credits 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 ewww. yeah. umm. i think im gonna stay here.

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 huh?

RACHEL:
 im having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?

PHOEBE:
 sure. yeah, hes kinda sexy.

RACHEL:
 oh no, no, ill be there too.

PHOEBE:
 okay so, well just come up with some kind of signal if its going well you can take off.

RACHEL:
 no phoebe! i just need you there for support. i havent told him im pregnant yet.

PHOEBE:
 oh. why not?

RACHEL:
 cause i know hes gonna flip out and i hate it when hes angry.

PHOEBE:
 oh rachel, this is all so papa dont preach.

RACHEL:
 what phoebe? wait! one time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again hed make me eat the entire pack.

PHOEBE:
 wow! oh well, i will be there! 

RACHEL:
 thank you.

PHOEBE:
 gosh. im not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.   oh. hey! who is that guy? i think i know him.

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!!! monica!! hes the stripper from your bachelorette party!!

CHANDLER:
 her what?!!

PHOEBE:
 your secret bachelorette party

CHANDLER:
 you had a bachelorette party?!

PHOEBE:
 she untied his g-string with her teeth. 

CHANDLER:
 i thought we werent gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.

JOEY:
 its a grand tradition!

MONICA:
 im sorry, they surprised me. there was nothing i could do!

RACHEL:
 well you couldve untied it with your hands.

JOEY:
 this is so unfair! the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, i wasnt allowed to. all i got was a stupid steak dinner!

CHANDLER:
 you went home with the waitress.

JOEY:
 oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.

CHANDLER:
 i cant believe you didnt tell me! you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!

MONICA:
 ugh, i knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass! opening credits  

 how about i order everyone the moroccan chicken?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i-i dont eat meat.

 its chicken.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i dont eat that either.

 ill never understand you lesbians.  mewhat is new with you.

RACHEL:
 well actually umm

 

 74?! i ordered the 75! thats a magnificent wine! the 74 is sewage! why would you bring me sewage?!  that a hard question? are you an idiot? is that why youre a waiter?

 this is why i told the manager i wouldnt wait on you tonight! 

 oh come on! dont be such a baby! 

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 hes right though, the 74 is absolute piss.

RACHEL:
 this was such a huge mistake. i cant tell him phoebe. i cant, i cant, i cant, i cant

PHOEBE:
 rachel!

RACHEL:
 no its okay, this is whats gonna happen. im gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.

PHOEBE:
 why, so he can get mad at the baby?

RACHEL:
 hey, that is thebabys problem.  everything okay with the waiter?

 i have no idea, i went to the bathroom. so sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.

RACHEL:
 well umm, i got tivo.

 whats tivo?

PHOEBE:
 its slang for pregnant.

RACHEL:
 phoebe!

 are you really pregnant?

RACHEL:
 well uh, yes and no. except not no. so to sum it up, yeah.

 who is the father? oh no! please dont tell me its her! 

RACHEL:
 no, its ross. its ross. you like ross.   oh daddy, i hope youre okay with all of this. i mean think about it, this is a good thing. youre gonnathis is your first grandchild! youre gonna be a poppy!

 thats true. 

RACHEL:
 yeah.

   so when is the wedding?

RACHEL:
 who?

 the wedding! theres going to be a wedding. young lady, dont you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard!   rachel karen green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!

RACHEL:
 february 2nd!   

 so it was really cool seeing you lecture today.

ROSS:
 oh thanks. although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.

 oh no-no, i-i had my eyes closed so i could concentrate and yknow take it all in.

ROSS:
 yeah, a lot of my students do that.

 so, i gotta get going.

ROSS:
 okay, i-ill see you tonight.

 yeah. 

ROSS:
 okay, bye.  

 oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. it was amazing! 

CHANDLER:
 my god! you must be good in bed!

JOEY:
 so uh, you and mona, been a while now. hows it going?

ROSS:
 ah, its good. its going good. i mean, we get along great. shes, shes so

JOEY:
 hot?

ROSS:
 well, i was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!

CHANDLER:
 shes okay with rachel and the baby?

ROSS:
 well ii havent actually told her yet. i dont want to scare her off, yknow?

CHANDLER:
 well, you have to honest with her! otherwise you may think that youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones.

JOEY:
 im gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.

MONICA:
  about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor party.

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 yeah, i got this number from this guy at work and i hired a stripper to come dance for you. am i going in the wife hall of fame or what?!

CHANDLER:
 honey! thats crazy! i dont want you to get me a stripper

JOEY:
 will you let the lady talk?!

MONICA:
 come on! come on, itll be fun! itll make me feel so much better.

CHANDLER:
 look, i appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. yknow? im not a bachelor anymore.

MONICA:
 so dont think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as aa two month anniversary present.

ROSS:
 sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!  

MONICA:
 please! i feel so bad! just watch the hot woman get naked!

CHANDLER:
 all right fine! but im only doing this for you!

JOEY:
 yeah!

CHANDLER:
 and joey.

MONICA:
 thank you. all right, now who else do you want to invite?

CHANDLER:
 ah, no-no-no just ross. ross and joey is embarrassing enough.

ROSS:
 uh actually, sorry i cant even make it. im seeing mona again tonight.

CHANDLER:
 i understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?

JOEY:
   

PHOEBE:
 im sorry i wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but im really busy that day. yeah, i already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

RACHEL:
 i know. i know. i panicked, i panicked. i didnt want him to start yelling at me like i was some 74 latour. 

PHOEBE:
 its lafite. the 74 latour is actually drinking quite nicely.

RACHEL:
 all right here he comes. im gonna do this, im gonna tell him, im gonna be strong.

 i just called a friend of mine.

RACHEL:
 yeah?

 i think i may be able to book the plaza on short notice.

RACHEL:
 really?! the plaza?!! oh daddy!!   right. daddy, i need to talk to you. please, sit down.

 what is it sweetie?

RACHEL:
 theres not gonna be a wedding. ross and i are not getting married.

 what?!

RACHEL:
 im sorry daddy.

 i dont believe this!!

RACHEL:
 oh now daddy, stay calm. please.

 stay calm?!! how do you expect me to stay calm?! this is unacceptable rachel! and i wanna know why?!! is it because that punk ross wont marry you?! thats it! is that it?!

RACHEL:
 yes. yes, he says im damaged goods.  of it, with only joey   enjoying a nice product placement of budweisers 

JOEY:
 so you uh, nervous about getting married?

CHANDLER:
 what are you doing?

JOEY:
 look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. okay? yknow? before your wedding. come on, itll be fun.

CHANDLER:
 okay. i cant believe tomorrows the big day.

JOEY:
 how does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.

CHANDLER:
 youre right, this is more fun. 

JOEY:
 thats her! okay, come on! 

 hi!

CHANDLER:
 hi. 

 so which one of you lucky boys is chandler?

JOEY:
 uh, that-thats-thats me!

CHANDLER:
 thats me.

JOEY:
 joey tribbiani, a big fan.

 so is that a bedroom? 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, yeah right over there.

 all right, whenever youre ready. 

CHANDLER:
 that was weird.

JOEY:
 why-why would she go in the bedroom?

 im waiting. 

CHANDLER:
 so shes a

JOEY:
 yeah, thats one naked hooker! 

 i love your place! where is this guy from?  

ROSS:
 uh thats an eighteenth century indian artifact from calcutta.

 oh wow! so, youre more than just dinosaurs.

ROSS:
 so much more.  calcutta off of his apothecary table from the days of yore and the magical city of white 

 oh my god! oh my god! im so sorry!

ROSS:
 aw forget it, its from pier one.   sorry. 

 you think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! im gonna kill you!!

ROSS:
 yknow this is actually not a great time for me. commercial break 

 so? come on! explain yourself geller! first you get my rachel pregnant!

 you got rachel pregnant?!

ROSS:
 who did?!

 you did!

ROSS:
 yes. yes, yes i did.  thing. it meant nothing.

 oh? really? thats what my daughter means to you? nothing?

ROSS:
 no! no sir umm, she means a lot to me. i mean, i carei-i love rachel.

 what?!

ROSS:
  with her. i love her like a, like a friend.

 oh really? thats how treat a friend? you get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?

ROSS:
 

 wh

ROSS:
 

 well why not? so you can spend your time with this tramp?!

 tramp?!

ROSS:
 im sorry. dr. green, mona. mona, dr. green.  

CHANDLER:
 i cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!

JOEY:
 wait! wait! maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do.

CHANDLER:
 could be. i mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. 

 uh, no. but i could pretend to strip, but thats gonna cost extra. okay, heres the extras, handcuffs, spanking  

JOEY:
 maybe monicas playing a joke on ya. yknow? getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.

CHANDLER:
 that is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.

JOEY:
 i bet ross was in on it too. i mean he was conveniently busy.

 do you mind if i smoke in here?

CHANDLER:
 oh actually, id rather youyeah, go ahead. were gonna have to burn that room down anyway. 

 how could you have kept all of this from me?

ROSS:
 i was going to tell you, but

 but what?! you figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel!

ROSS:
 hey! i did not dump rachel!  phone rings and ross goes to answer it, only hes trapped behind the apothecary table  can i just  machine get that?

JOEY:
  we thought maybe youd know something about it.

ROSS:
 no! no! no! no! no! i-i-i-ii need to, i need to lie down.  

 so, tonights the night of the big bachelor party?

MONICA:
 yeah! hey! thanks for getting me that girls number.

 no problem. so whos the party for?

MONICA:
 my husband.

 you hired your husband a hooker?

MONICA:
 shes a stripper.

 no, shes a hooker.

MONICA:
 is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?

 when theyre hookers.

MONICA:
 oh my god stu! i-i cant believe you did this! now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?

 either that or shes just the best, most expensive date i ever had.   

JOEY:
 maybe she meant to get you a hooker.

CHANDLER:
 why would she do that?

JOEY:
 maybe she wants you to learn something. huh? now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?

CHANDLER:
 this is the worst bachelor party ever!

 whats taking you boys so long?

JOEY:
 in a minute!

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 all right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.

CHANDLER:
 why me?!

JOEY:
 hey! its your bachelor party.

CHANDLER:
 which is why you should do it.

ROSS:
 so your dad dropped by. hes a pleasant man!

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 id better go.  3000, the chair that sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at

 i dont want to miss the fight.

RACHEL:
 ross im so sorry. okay. i-i will promise i will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.

ROSS:
 i dont care about your dad! i care about mona! she was there and now shes totally freaked out!

RACHEL:
 oh okay, ill fix that to. whats her e-mail address?

ROSS:
 rachel!

RACHEL:
 all right, i promise. ill fix this. i swear. ill-ill-ill-ill talk to her.

ROSS:
 okay!

RACHEL:
 okay.

ROSS:
 thank you!

PHOEBE:
 thats it?! you call that a fight? come on! "we were on a break!" "no we werent!" what happened to you two?! 

ROSS:
 thank you so much for coming back over.

 oh good, youre here. yeah, and i was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.

RACHEL:
 i know mona, just hear me out. first of all, im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but i heard you totally held your own. youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.

ROSS:
 focus.

RACHEL:
 okay. umbutokay, yes ross and i used to date. and yes we are gonna have a baby. but we are definitely not getting back together.

 how can i be sure on that?

RACHEL:
 oh we justwe drove each other crazy!

ROSS:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 i mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!

ROSS:
 trying to date this woman.

RACHEL:
 right! but, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. 

ROSS:
 probably shouldnt touch me.

 yknow, i-i-i justi dont want to get in the middle of something so complicated.

RACHEL:
 i know, i get it, but mona, what relationship is not complicated? i mean we all have our baggage! you must too! why else would you still be single?   i am so gonna leave right now. 

ROSS:
 should i leave this open for you too?

 im not sure yet. why didnt you just tell me about all this?

ROSS:
 because whats going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you.

 yeah? well you still shoulda told me.

ROSS:
 i know and i was going to, but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachels father. look ii made a mistake, but its only because i really, really like you. really!

 okay, i guess you canclose the door now. 

RACHEL:
   im going!   

MONICA:
 i swear i didnt know she was a hooker! i mean whdid you let her smoke in here?

CHANDLER:
 her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?

MONICA:
 yknow what? im gonna make this up to you. i promised you a stripper  

CHANDLER:
 monica! wait!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
   

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 gotcha sailor.   closing credits  hes been going on for so long rachel is holding the phone away from her ear and 

  you cant

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 about an hour ago.

PHOEBE:
 wanna go see a movie?

RACHEL:
 yes!   bye daddy. 

   unacceptable rachel! what the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! there are more important things in a marriage other than love!   constantly thinking about things! you have to think about the consequences of your decision.  

JOEY:
 hey rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.

RACHEL:
  

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 i brought you my old maternity clothes! 

RACHEL:
 oh pheebs thats so sweet those are so cute!

PHOEBE:
 yeah! and look,   great for shoplifting melons.

MONICA:
  oclock.  high school?

RACHEL:
 no.

MONICA:
 he was in rosss classmarching bandkinda overweight? well, really overweight. i mean i was his thin friend.

RACHEL:
 wow! i dont remember him. honey, are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.

MONICA:
 no that was jarred! wow! i havent thought about him in a long time  wills, wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so i invited him here.

RACHEL:
 oh thats nice.

MONICA:
 oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. i mean he looks goo-ood! okay, i mean really, really gorgeous!  love chandler.

JOEY:
 i just want you to say it once in a while.

MONICA:
 all right okay, just so you know, im not gonna make a turkey this year.

JOEY:
 what?!

MONICA:
 well phoebe doesnt eat turkey

JOEY:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals!

JOEY:
 no theyre not! theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!

MONICA:
 all right! okay, its just phoebe. wills still on a diet, chandler doesnt eat thanksgiving food, and rachels having her aversion to poultry.

JOEY:
 she is?

RACHEL:
 remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?

JOEY:
 yeah. but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.

MONICA:
 anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. okay? its a lot of work.

JOEY:
 but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving! i mean, thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like fourth of july with no apple pie! or friday with no two pizzas!

MONICA:
 all right fine! if it means that much to you! but justtheres gonna be a ton left over.

JOEY:
 no there wont! i promise i will finish that turkey!

MONICA:
 all right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?

JOEY:
 thats right! cause im a tribbiani!  is what we do! i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! we can eat! opening credits  the right game green bay at detroit  

MONICA:
 hey, isnt weird to think about how next year at this time theyll be a little baby at the table?   rachels! but good to know where youre at!

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 happy thanksgiving!

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 sure!

MONICA:
 im gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

 hey.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
  screamed something. maybe we should.

PHOEBE:
 oh okay.

CHANDLER:
 oh come on!

PHOEBE:
 noooo!! damn you ref! you burn in hell!!! 

MONICA:
 hey, what are you doing? you gotta save room, youve got almost an entire turkey to eat.

JOEY:
 let me explain to you how the human body works. i have to warm my stomach first. eatin chips is like stretching.

MONICA:
 all right.

JOEY:
 dont worry, tribbianis never get full.

 i actually know what youre talking about. im here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 what?  we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? the smell is just yuck!

 

RACHEL:
 im sorry. what?

 i said it was typical. typical of you, rachel green, queen rachel does whatever she wants in little rachel land. 

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 umm, im sorry. do you-do you have a problem with me?

 i dont know? do i? do i?

PHOEBE:
 i think you do.

MONICA:
  school.

 a little mean? you made my life miserable!

RACHEL:
 im-imi had no idea. im sorry. i

 well you should be. screw it! bring on the yams!

MONICA:
 oh will. but you-youve worked so hard

 yams!!!! 

MONICA:
 okay.  

RACHEL:
 uh will umm, i just want to say that im real sorry for whatever i-i did to you in high school

 oh, it wasnt just me. we had a club!

RACHEL:
 you had a club?!

 thats right, the i hate rachel green club!

RACHEL:
 whoa! my god! so what, you all just joined together to hate me?! who else was in this club?

 me and ross. 

ROSS:
 no need to point, she knows who ross is. commercial break 

RACHEL:
 

 yes he was. 

ROSS:
 no. no.

RACHEL:
 so who else was in this club?

ROSS:
 uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from thailand but i-i dont think he-he knew what it was.

RACHEL:
 so ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an i hate rachel club.

 you went out with her?! we had a pact!

ROSS:
 that was in high school! its not like it was binding forever.

 then why did it have the word eternity in it?

RACHEL:
 okay monica, did you know about this?!

MONICA:
 i swear i didnt.  to go up to your bedroom and lock the door? 

 yeah.

MONICA:
 hmm, a little relieved, i gotta say.

ROSS:
 look rach i-im sorry, okay? ii was a stupid kid, okay? the only reason i joined

 co-founded!

ROSS:
 co-founded. co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you. obviously i didnt handle it very well. but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club.

 uh, except that it was really the i hate rachel club.

RACHEL:
 okay. so what? you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?

 well, we did a little more than that.

ROSS:
 no-no! no-no. no-no.

PHOEBE:
 what?! what else did you do?

 we started a rumor.

RACHEL:
 what rumor?

PHOEBE:
 oh, come on will! just take off your shirt and tell us!

RACHEL:
 ross!

ROSS:
 it was no big deal. we-wesaid that the rumor wasthat ummyou had bothmale and female reproductive parts.

RACHEL:
 what?!

 thats right! we said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 you started that?!

RACHEL:
 what?! you heard that?! 

MONICA:
 everyone at our school heard it!

CHANDLER:
 everybody at my school heard it! you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island?!

RACHEL:
 oh no!!!! oh my god!! this is all making so much sense to me now! this is why adam carter wouldnt go out with me! this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region! 

ROSS:
 actually, billy tratt is gay now. so-so that ones not really our fault.

RACHEL:
 monica, how come you never told me this?!

MONICA:
 i thought it might be true. and i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.  

RACHEL:
 joey stop staring! theres nothing there! its not true!

JOEY:
 im afraid im gonna need proof.

RACHEL:
 oh!   

JOEY:
 you are my everest.

MONICA:
 joey, you dont have to finish that.

JOEY:
 oh yes i do. otherwise whats next? today im just a guy who cant finish a turkey, but tomorrow im the guy who eats half a powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? no! no, i justi justi gotta change my pants. 

RACHEL:
  in my yearbook senior year, "dear rach, youre such a good person." not girl! person!

ROSS:
 rach, i think youre reading a little too much into it.

RACHEL:
  person. sorry about your tiney-wienie." 

ROSS:
 look, what do you want me to do? do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasnt true?!

RACHEL:
 yes!

 could you also tell them im skinny now?

MONICA:
 oh! me too!

ROSS:
 well look-look im not calling anybody! okay? it was like a million years ago!

RACHEL:
 i dont care how long ago it was! you told people that i was half and half! yknow what? i just want to point out i never did anything to hurt you in high school.

MONICA:
 thats not totally true.

RACHEL:
 what?

ROSS:
 what?

MONICA:
 well you-you did start that rumor about ross making out with mrs. altman, our 50-year-old librarian.

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 its true?!!

ROSS:
 no.

RACHEL:
 yes it is! i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog! 

 mrs. altman? she also made out with takaka ci-kek the night before he went back to thailand.

CHANDLER:
 im sorry. when you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?

ROSS:
 hey! she didnt look 50!

CHANDLER:
 did she look 16?

RACHEL:
 ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.

PHOEBE:
 oh! 

ROSS:
 she didnt photograph well!

CHANDLER:
 well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!

PHOEBE:
 so how did this happen? did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?

ROSS:
 i was working late in the library one afternoon. it was just the two of us. she needed some help with her word jumble. and one thing led to another. if you must know, anita was very gentle and tender. may she rest in peace

MONICA:
 didnt she walk with a cane?

ROSS:
 only when it was damp!!  people about this?! everybody knew?! yknow what?  club!

 yeah! 

PHOEBE:
 i wanna join!

RACHEL:
 whphoebe!!

PHOEBE:
 im sorry. im sorry. i never got to be in a club. i-i didnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french. bonjour.

RACHEL:
 all right, yknowfine! you guys have your stupid little club, but i would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you! you gave me a tiney-wienie! 

MONICA:
 all right, listen youre just being silly. rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. one girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll!

RACHEL:
 wow

MONICA:
 and ross, if it werent for rachels rumor i mean no one in high school would even know who you were. she put you on the map!

ROSS:
 as a romancer of the elderly.

MONICA:
 hey! mrs. altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.

ROSS:
 the eyesdid still sparkle.

MONICA:
 hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. you-youve been through so much since then. and right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. cant you just let this go?

RACHEL:
 shes right.

ROSS:
 yeah. i mean we are having a baby together.

 hold on! you got her pregnant?

ROSS:
 yeah.

 are ya getting married?

ROSS:
 nope.

 so you knocked her up but youre not gonna marry her. dude!   anybody?

PHOEBE:
 okay.  it would be.

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 im sorry, they just, they just look so good! and the saleswoman was looking at me like, "oh, these are way too expensive for you."

CHANDLER:
 she had a point. 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 wow! theyre beautiful!

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 what?!

MONICA:
 the guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!

RACHEL:
 well-well you can give them to me! i havent felt my feet in years!

MONICA:
 i cant! i spent so much money on them and i told chandler that id wear them all the time, i just cant give them away!

PHOEBE:
 well then get your money back and return them!

MONICA:
 i cant do that either! the soles are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 hey i uh just picked up ben from school

CHANDLER:
  thorough job!

ROSS:
 i dropped him off at carols.  im not going to be able to get those tickets though.

PHOEBE:
 oh no! why not?

ROSS:
 well it turns out that ben and stings son do not get along.

PHOEBE:
 how come?!

ROSS:
 apparently, stings son made fun of the fact that bens moms are lesbinims.

PHOEBE:
 wait! but ross if they dont get along then you should smooth things over. make them be friends.

ROSS:
 phoebe, you cant force kids to be friends.

PHOEBE:
 sure you can! give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!

ROSS:
 playpen?! bens seven!

PHOEBE:
 your kid is seven?!  hes really small. 

ROSS:
 look im sorry pheebs, i cant do it.

PHOEBE:
 yes you can! sting says so himself!

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 look phoebe, im sorry its just

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 phoebe, i

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 my little sister dina!

RACHEL:
 right! hi dina! 

 hi.

RACHEL:
 nice to meet you. 

 thanks so much for meetin with me. joeys told me so much about you!

JOEY:
 this is so exciting for her. well, ill let you two fashists get down to business. 

RACHEL:
 okay. all right dina, well lets talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. lets see, theres design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. uh, theres-theres sales, which is great because you get to travel

 ii dont care about fashion! im pregnant! and i know you are too, so you gotta help me!

RACHEL:
   on the step and changes from wearing tennis shoes to the boots and she moans in pain as 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 oh nothing im justjust was yawning.  

CHANDLER:
 oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight.  

MONICA:
 honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we?

CHANDLER:
 now sweetie, i know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. see? every cloud has asupple leather lining.

MONICA:
 i-i dont-i dont think that im gonna wear the boots tonight.

CHANDLER:
 why not?

MONICA:
 well yknow, im just-im just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. or! or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!

CHANDLER:
 do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company?

MONICA:
 anyway, i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it.

CHANDLER:
 you said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!

MONICA:
 fine! if you want me to wear the boots, ill wear the boots. in fact, ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.

CHANDLER:
 okay.

MONICA:
 okay?  christmas party in my boots!    

 i-i cant go in there. i cant tell him!

RACHEL:
 honey, its going to be okay. hes been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; thats what the meatball sub is for.  

 thank you.

RACHEL:
 okay. 

JOEY:
 hey! its my fashion girls!  wrong?

RACHEL:
 honey, why dont you sit down? dina has something that she wants to tell you.

JOEY:
  is it dads heart? is that a sandwich?

 joe, mom and dad are fine

JOEY:
 is that a sandwich?!

RACHEL:
 joeytheres something that youshould know. dina?

 im pregnant.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
  

JOEY:
 well obviously this is a mistake! you cant be pregnant! because you have to have sex to get pregnant!

 joe, i tried to wait until i was 25 like you did!

RACHEL:
 what?! dina

JOEY:
  cant believe this! youre the good one! you went to college! both years! who did this to you?!

 bobby corso, but hes a real nice guy. i like him a lot. hes real funny.

JOEY:
 you got pregnant for funny?! dinaif hes funnylaugh! all right, ill be back in a little while! you stay here!

 why? where are you going?

JOEY:
 i cant look at you right now! 

 wow.

RACHEL:
 i know.   commercial break  

PHOEBE:
 oh, there you are ben!

 aunt phoebe, what are you doing here?

PHOEBE:
 well, i heard youre having a problem with one of the boys in your class. and so i thought i would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. now umm, the boys name is stings son.

 jack? i hate him! hes a jerk.

PHOEBE:
 now ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.

 i have to go. my friend doug is waiting for me over there.  

PHOEBE:
 him youre friends with.  

 excuse me. can, can i help you with something?

PHOEBE:
 yes! yes you can, im looking for jacks parents.

 are you with one of the students?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh, im with ben.

 are you one of bens mothers?

PHOEBE:
 i am one of bens mothers. im a lesbian. it was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.

 well hi, im jenny boone. im the new teacher here.

PHOEBE:
 oh.

 ive only met your partner carol.

PHOEBE:
 ah! okay so that would make me susan.

 right. are you looking for jacks parents to discuss the problems hes having with ben?  do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! lets do that!! that-that sounds good. we should sit down and talk, just me, my lover carol, and the stings. umm, how-how will i get in touch with them?

 oh, their number is on the contact sheet.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. uh-huh. umm, could-could i get a copy of that? cause carol threw it out, she lost ours. shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.  

CHANDLER:
 yknow, that party wasnt bad.

MONICA:
 yeah! i didnt know there would be dancing. that was a fun surprise!

CHANDLER:
 i dont see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk?

MONICA:
 oh no, we cant walk!

CHANDLER:
 what honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. lets go.

MONICA:
 hey! do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?

CHANDLER:
 whats going on?

MONICA:
 i cant walk. okay? okay? these boots were a huge mistake!

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 okay you were right! all right, i never should have bought them! theyre killing me! one toe at a time!

CHANDLER:
 so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right.  its oddly unsettling.

MONICA:
 how are we gonna get home? maybe a piggy-back ride?

CHANDLER:
 hop on.

MONICA:
 okay. wait, just give me a second, i need to just get my boots off first.  godohhohohhohhhh

CHANDLER:
 honey, i know youre in pain right now, but im a little turned on.  

 do you ever worry that youll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?

RACHEL:
 what college was that dina? 

 oh my god! bobby!

 hi dina. good to see you.

RACHEL:
 joey, what are you doing?

JOEY:
 just what needs to be done! dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman

RACHEL:
 oh joey this is crazy!

JOEY:
 dont interrupt me when im talkin to god! now where were we? oh right, okay. do you dina, take this man

 no!

JOEY:
 oh youll take em!

 no i wont!

JOEY:
 hey! you dont get a say in this!

 yes i do!

JOEY:
 ahhh! i heard "i do", were halfway there! okay!  you!

RACHEL:
 all right joey! that is enough!   listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, its not legal. okay? they-they dont have a marriage license, they dont have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!

 yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.

JOEY:
 well what am i supposed to do?

RACHEL:
 youre supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.

JOEY:
 no they cant! they were stupid enough to get knocked up!

RACHEL:
 heyyyyy! contraceptives are not always effective!  right?

 yeahwe kinda didnt use any

RACHEL:
 oh, come on kids! a little help here!  

PHOEBE:
 wow! this place is incredible!  gave to phoebe.  come on! secret passageway! 

 hi! 

PHOEBE:
 hi!

 im trudie.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh.

 you must be bens mum.

PHOEBE:
 why else would i be here?

 do sit down.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. 

 i gather jack and ben havent been getting along lately.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

 im told there are two sides to this story, but all ive heard is that bens a bit of a poo-poo head.

PHOEBE:
 umm, im sorry. wont-wont jacks father be joining us?

 oh im sorry, jacks father is not available.

PHOEBE:
 uh-hmm. okay. well then, could we reschedule? for say, friday night perhaps at 8 oclock?

 oh no, i know that wouldnt work. my husbands in concert.

PHOEBE:
 concert. yeah. that does put us inquite a pickle. because you see im very busy before and after the concert, and hes obviously busy during.

 so, i guess you and i should talk about jack and ben right now.

PHOEBE:
 unless! unless umm, okay i-i would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.

 are you here for tickets?

PHOEBE:
 oh, thank you. four would be great.

 im not giving concert tickets to someone whod use their son like this!

PHOEBE:
 oh good! then youre in luck! bens not my son!

  silent alarm. any minute now, the police will be here!

PHOEBE:
 the police? here? a reunion?!  

CHANDLER:
 okay, ten blocks down. five to go.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh im sorry! do you need a break?

MONICA:
 my boots in tan! hey! can you get a little closer so i can see the price?

CHANDLER:
 i can see it from right here. itll cost you one husband.

MONICA:
 okay, im sorry. i think i can walk the rest of the way now. just-just give me my boots.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 well i dont have them either. where are they?

CHANDLER:
 well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay!

MONICA:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?

MONICA:
 okay, im never gonna wear them again. i just didnt get a chance to say goodbye.

CHANDLER:
 yknow what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones.

MONICA:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

MONICA:
   

RACHEL:
 joey, just because theyre not getting married doesnt mean this is going to be a disaster. maybe they have a plan!

JOEY:
 oh? oh! okay! okay! lets hear their plan! now, whats the future look like for dina and bobby?

 welli really have high hopes for my band.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 hey, now wait a minute! i get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! now come on bobby, why dont you tell us a little bit about your band?

 well its just me and my pal rooster, the bands name is numb nuts.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! even if it is to bobby! 

 no joey! i knew you wouldnt be supportive!

JOEY:
 so whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! what are you gonna do? youre gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?! you cant be a single mother alone! youre gonna ruin your life!

RACHEL:
 oh excuse me! am i ruining my life?

JOEY:
 no! no! no! its different for you. youre so strong and together. youre not some dumb kid who doesnt know what shes doing.

 excuse me?

JOEY:
 one pregnant woman at a time, please! i just want you to be okay.

RACHEL:
 so forcing her to marry bobby is gonna make that happen?

JOEY:
 maybe!  nutsoh forget it! i cant!

 joey, i am scared to death about this. but i really think i can do it, im just gonna need some help. and bobbys gonna be here the whole time.

 you bet i am!  straight-up gangster rap. 

 look, rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. why cant you do that for me?

JOEY:
 because! cause cause youre my baby sister!

 and youre my big brother! i mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world. im not even scared to tell mom and dad. i was scared of telling you.

JOEY:
 well id be scared of them, but all right.

 joey, i cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. i want him to have his uncle. is my baby gonna have his uncle joey?

JOEY:
 of course hes gonna have his uncle joey!

 were gonna be all right. i mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. not just by us.

JOEY:
 thats right! by his uncle too!

 and by you.

RACHEL:
 okay bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment. 

JOEY:
 come here! 

RACHEL:
 no! seriously! whats wrong with you?! closing credits 

ROSS:
 youre gonna love me so much. i got sting tickets!! 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! i do love you! how did you do it?!

ROSS:
 welllets just say 

PHOEBE:
 oo, where are the seats?

ROSS:
 uh, middle balcony.

PHOEBE:
 okay, now would you say that thats more than 50 yards away from sting, his wife, or a member of his family?

ROSS:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 phoebe?

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 look at that guy by the window, wow!

PHOEBE:
 hes awfully short and i think hes talking to himself. and to  be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.

RACHEL:
 oh, what is wrong with me lately? i mean its like every guy i  seei mean look here.   normally thats not someone i would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the  way im feeling, all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.

PHOEBE:
 wait a second! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 this is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start  going crazy.

RACHEL:
 really?! so this has happened to you?

PHOEBE:
 oh absolutely yeah! oh and keep in mind, now, i was carrying triplets so  in, yknow, medical terms i was-i was thrice as randy.

RACHEL:
 wow! this explains so much! last weekend, i went from store to store  sitting on santas lap.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. yeah, i remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of evander  holyfield from a foot locker.

RACHEL:
 ah.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 well, yknow what? i go see my doctor tomorrow, ill ask her  about this. maybe she can give me a pill or something.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. yeah, thats what you need a goodpill. opening credits 

 hey! 

ROSS:
 hi!

 hi! look! i got our pictures developed from rockefeller center.

ROSS:
 oh great! hey-hey joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and mona  ice skating?

JOEY:
 oh uh, ordinarily i would love too, but i am just swamped right now.    

ROSS:
 hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us  together?

 oh yeah, probably at the end.   pictures of my breasts!

JOEY:
 im missin picture time?!   

PHOEBE:
 

 okay. okay, heres a good one of us.

ROSS:
 wow! that is a good one! wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card  yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.

 yknow, every year i say im gonna send out holiday cards and i  never do it. do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?

ROSS:
 

 yeah, yknow. happy holidays from mona and ross. itll be cute,  okay?

ROSS:
 okay. 

 oh, i gotta get to work. so call me later?

ROSS:
 uh sure, sure.

 bye guys.

PHOEBE:
 bye. 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 i know. can you believe that?

PHOEBE:
 wait, im-im sorry. whats the big deal about a holiday  card?

ROSS:
 married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have  been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! what-what is she crazy?!

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey, hey thats your wife youre talking about! 

 bing! ho! and the bing-ette!

CHANDLER:
 honey, you remember my boss doug right?

MONICA:
 yes, hi.

 hi. so good news, the divorce is final. i signed the papers this a.m.

CHANDLER:
 i didnt know you and carol were getting divorced, im  sorry.

 sorry? finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. hey, congratulations  to you guys though!

MONICA:
 no leg-chewing for us sir.

 oh well, give it time. so the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot  to celebrate. how about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?

MONICA:
 i cant think of anything were doing.   cant i think of anything were doing?

 tomorrow night it is then, i should be out of court by six. they keep  throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and i keep knocking them out of the park!

MONICA:
 okay, ill see you tomorrow!   were not seeing him tomorrow.   evening with that man. do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?

CHANDLER:
 no.

MONICA:
 thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved  at our engagement party.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah. boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture  doesnt it? 

 hi!

ROSS:
 hey!

 hey, i went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.  what do you think?

ROSS:
 huh. wow, this is great.

 now, do you think it should say, "love ross and mona?"

ROSS:
 well, we-we havent said that to each other yet, but i guess its okay  to say it to other people.

 how many did you want? im getting a hundred.

ROSS:
 a hundred?! well, i-i guess ill take amona, uhi-im  not sure about the whole uh, card thing.

 really? why not?

ROSS:
 sending out a holiday card, together, i mean i just dont know if  were really quite there yet.

 oh yknow, i didnt think of it that way. youre right.  youre right. so, can i ask you a question? 

ROSS:
 yeah.

 where are we?

ROSS:
 huh.

 yknow, like where are we? where is this relationship going?

ROSS:
 hmm

 i mean i love spending time with you, yknow i justi hope  were moving forward. i mean, we should probably talk about that. dont you  think? 

ROSS:
 lets do the card!

 what?

ROSS:
 the card! i think were there!

 okay. ibut i think we should still have this conversation.

ROSS:
 really?! i mean, even with the card?   

 hi!

RACHEL:
 hi!

 just so you know, dr. long cant be here today, she was called to  the hospital, so dr. schiff will be seeing you.

RACHEL:
 oh, okay. hey, can i ask you a question? was it me, or-or was the guy  who took my blood sample really cute? yknow who im talking about, bald  haircut, hairy fingers 

   

RACHEL:
 yes, you are.

 so, hows it going?

RACHEL:
 oh, really, really good. but enough about me, come on! where-where are  you from? what do you do?

 im a doctor.

RACHEL:
 right! right! i-i actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? do you  ski? or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?

 uh, i dont have a wife or girlfriend, but i do like to ski.

RACHEL:
 oh, i love to ski! how amazing is this?!

 so, are you experiencing any discomfort?

RACHEL:
 no. im very comfortable.

 any painful gas?

RACHEL:
 no! shoot, dr. schiff what kind of question is that?!

 okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?

RACHEL:
 well would you like me to lie down on the table?

 im sorry, is there something going on here?

RACHEL:
 do you feel it too? 

RACHEL:
 hi.

PHOEBE:
 oh hey! so, how did your doctors appointment go?

RACHEL:
 well, lets see. uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the  middle of the exam i put my pinky in his chin dimple.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god.

MONICA:
 why did you do that?

PHOEBE:
 okay, remember that little problem i was having during my  fourth month of  pregnancy?

MONICA:
 oh yeah, the evander holyfield phase. oh man you were so hard up you  practically came on to me.

PHOEBE:
 you wish.

MONICA:
 hey, i couldve had you if i wanted you.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah? come and get it.

RACHEL:
 okay, even this is turning me on!

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 oh hey! hey ross! hey hows it, hows it going with you and  mona? are you guys still together?

ROSS:
 oh yeah, yeah were moving forward. youll be getting our card!

MONICA:
 you and mona are doing a holiday card together?

ROSS:
 yeah, were not just doing a card! yknow, she-she also wants to  have the conversation about where the relationship is going.

PHOEBE:
 ugh! women!

ROSS:
 i know! i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation?! huh? i  mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "so, where is this going?"

RACHEL:
 uh ross? you asked me that.

ROSS:
 hey! you were a closed book! okay? im not a mind reader! besides, i  hate those conversations. im horrible at them. really! maybe-maybe i need kind of a  gesture. yknow, something that says were moving forward without having to talk  about it.

MONICA:
 like asking her to move in with you?

ROSS:
 smaller than that.

MONICA:
 making her a mixed tape?

ROSS:
 uh, bigger than that.

PHOEBE:
 give her a key to your apartment.

ROSS:
 whoa-hello! we were closer with the mixed tape.

MONICA:
 all right. have you said, "i love you?" you could say, i love  you.

ROSS:
 yeah i-i dont-i dont think im quite there yet, but i  could say i looove spending time with you.

PHOEBE:
 no, we hate that.

MONICA:
 that is a slap in the face.

ROSS:
 forget it. i-iyknow what? ill just have the  conversation. ill just say i like things the way they are, and hope for the best.  what do you think rach?

RACHEL:
 i think, if it was a little colder in here i could see your nipples  through that sweater. 

 bing! were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.

CHANDLER:
 oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. monica has to work.

 oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother  work. fine. tomorrow night then.

CHANDLER:
 oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.

 oh? why not?

CHANDLER:
 its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.

 whats going on bing? does uh, your wife have a problem with me or  something?

CHANDLER:
 well now-now youre just talking crazy.

 so why cant the three of us go out together?

CHANDLER:
 because uhwe-wewe split up. monica and i split up. hold  me.

 good god bing iwell i cant say im altogether surprised,  i saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. and the way she looked at  me, pure lust.

CHANDLER:
 yknow what would really help me through this tough time is  choking something. can i choke ya?

 bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. now heres the plan,  grab your coat, were going to a strip club.

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no, monica would freak.   that bitch. 

ROSS:
 here we go. mona umm, i think its time we-we had a conversation  about-about where things are with us.

 yeah, i-i think i suggested that.

ROSS:
 aw, we-we are so  i-i-i like you and i-i love umm, yknow hanging out with you. and i mean-im  having a lot of fun.   

 okay.

ROSS:
 i mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if  its just fun. its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? so  where-where is it going?   the answer isis its going somewherefun. now i-i know what youre  thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre  not getting any younger. no i meanno not you, not you, youyou are  getting younger. i meanyou-you look like youre getting younger by the  secondwhats your secret?

 im sorry, so umm, so where are we?

ROSS:
 well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young.

 okay

ROSS:
 but thats not enough. so soheres a key to my  apartment. 

 really?!

ROSS:
 really.

 you dont think this is too fast.   commercial break   

RACHEL:
 you gave her a key to your apartment?!

ROSS:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 rachel umm, i was just talking to this guy and i think hell have  sex with you.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.

RACHEL:
 no! i do not care what my hormones are doing, i am not going to just do  it with some random guy!

PHOEBE:
 fine! then you tell roger because he was really looking forward to this!   

 oh bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. let me buy you a lap  dance with those girls. huh?

CHANDLER:
 oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl.

 bingwhats this?! 

CHANDLER:
 its a hand. its a thing you use as a jack and coke  holder.

 no, its a wedding ring. you gotta get rid of it. were gonna go  to the east river right now and throw it in there!

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no!

 oh yeah-yeah-yeah, yknow i did it and i felt a hell of a lot better  and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.   

ROSS:
 okay, and oh im gonna need a bunch of extra keys. apparently i give  them away for no reason at all.

 

ROSS:
 no. that guy is.

 i dont understand. you-you give me a key to your apartment and then  you change the lock.

 good luck buddy. 

 umm, i-i thought we were moving forward and now youre-youre  sending me all these mixed signals. what are you trying to tell me?

ROSS:
 im trying to tell you i made you a mix tape.

 what?

ROSS:
 i love you!

 ohh!    

CHANDLER:
 hi honey im home.

MONICA:
 from the tequila factory?

CHANDLER:
 it was awful. to get out of going to dinner with doug i told him that  you and i split up. so then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then  when i wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!

MONICA:
 come here. i can breath through my mouth.

CHANDLER:
 yknow what the worse part was? i got to see what my life would  be like without you. it was like its a wonderful life with lap dances. please  promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each  other for the rest of our lives.

MONICA:
 i promise. hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday  card this year?

CHANDLER:
 ooh, i dont know if were there yet. 

RACHEL:
 yes. hi, id like to order a pizza. okay, can i ask you a question?  is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? very ambercrombie & fitch.    ill call you back.

JOEY:
 who was that?

RACHEL:
 its just the pizza place.

JOEY:
 you hung up on the pizza place? i dont hang up on your friends.

RACHEL:
 im sorry honey, im just having a, having a rough day.

JOEY:
 oh, whats wrong?

RACHEL:
 oh you really, you really just dont want to hear about it.

JOEY:
 then why did i ask?

RACHEL:
 okay, its justand this is really embarrassingbut  lately with this whole pregnancy thing im just finding myselfhow do i put this  umm, erotically charged.

JOEY:
 is that college talk for horny?

RACHEL:
 yeah. so yknow, i have all of these feelings and i dont know  what to do about them, because i cant date like a normal person, which is fine  because i dont need a relationship, i mean all i really want is one great night.  just sex, yknow? no strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that i feel  comfortable with and who knows what hes doing. for just one great night, i mean is  that really sohardto find. 

JOEY:
 good, i uh, i saw a pretty big pigeon.

RACHEL:
 well, i gotta get up early and its almost seven oclock.

JOEY:
 yeah, i gotta, i gotta go to my room too.

RACHEL:
 okay, good night!

JOEY:
 good night.  

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 youre rachel!

RACHEL:
 youre joey!

JOEY:
 youre my friend!

RACHEL:
 right back at ya!

JOEY:
 but plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.

RACHEL:
 and so bad. i dont even know what youre talking about  because i didnt ask you to do anything!

JOEY:
 i know! 

JOEY:
 do you wanna do it?

RACHEL:
 no!

JOEY:
 all right, me neither! i was just testing you!

RACHEL:
 thats the end of this conversation!

JOEY:
 this conversation never happened!

RACHEL:
 never happened! good night!

JOEY:
 good night!   

JOEY:
 get back in there!  closing credits

MONICA:

ROSS:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 ooh, i miss dating. gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy  restaurant. im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!  i mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not  fun.

JOEY:
 hey, yknow what?

RACHEL:
 huh?

JOEY:
 why dont i take you out?

RACHEL:
 what?! joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.

JOEY:
 yes i do! and were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time,  and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching  out

RACHEL:
   with ya.

JOEY:
 ill be fun.

RACHEL:
 all right? 

PHOEBE:
 no. no! yes! ahh. oh, would you look at that monica? i just knocked off  all of your top scores, how sad.

MONICA:
 okay, im next.   dont start another game! i said im next! phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 oh, im sorry. i didnt hear you over all the winning.

MONICA:
 chandler! phoebes hogging the game!

CHANDLER:
 who cares? its a stupid game.

MONICA:
 you only think its stupid because you suck at it.

CHANDLER:
 i dont suck. its sucks. you suck.

PHOEBE:
 wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,  then maybe i should just keep it.

MONICA:
 no! no-no! i love it! it is a great present! in fact, why dont you  go home and wait for the thank you card?

CHANDLER:
 why do you want to play this game so bad?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! its not like it spits out a clark bar after every  game.

MONICA:
 okay. phoebe thats it. come on, get outout of the chair. get  out!   comephoebe!   

RACHEL:
 joey? could you get that?    what are you doing here? i thought you were in your room?

JOEY:
 no, im picking you up for our date. these are for you.   

RACHEL:
 ohh, lilies. joey, theyre my favorite. thank you.

JOEY:
 and, a brownie!   brownie. actually, its just bag. its been a long walk from the flower shop and  i was startin to feel faint so

RACHEL:
 oh man! this is so great! i actually feel like im going on a real  date! although, i have a hint of morning sickness, and im wearing underwear that  goes up to about  there.

JOEY:
 hey come on now, this is a real date. uh, sonice place you got here.  foosball, huh? pizza box. oh, a subscription to playboy, my kind of woman.

RACHEL:
 yeah, actually thats my roommates.

JOEY:
 i would like to meet him. he sounds like a stand up guy.

RACHEL:
 ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch  yourself.

JOEY:
 ah hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?

RACHEL:
 hm-mmm.

JOEY:
 oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 no-no-no-no, hes not! no! why are you trying to ruin the game? come  on! 

ROSS:
 which brings us back, of course, to greelys theory of dominance.    freeman building is?

 yeah, its the new building on avenue a.

ROSS:
 what?! that-thats all the way cross town, im supposed to teach  a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.

 ooh, dude. thats not gonna happen.   

ROSS:
 move it! move it! move it!! hey!!! im the teacher!! 

ROSS:
 hello.   sorry im a little late. ah  start by uh, by introducing myself, i am professor geller.   im professor geller. good job today. 

RACHEL:
 now the filet mignon, what comes with that?

 theres a side of steamed vegetables.

RACHEL:
 emmm. now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway i can substitute  the three-pound lobster?

JOEY:
 yknow what? bring her both, and ill have the same.   

RACHEL:
 wow! this is shaping up to be a pretty good dateoh, i almost  forgot. i didnt pay you the rent check.

JOEY:
 oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. okay? were on a date.

RACHEL:
 okay. wow! so i get to see what joey tribbiani is like on a date. so do  you have any moves?

JOEY:
 no! no. umm, just myself and if they dont like me for  im sorry i couldnt even get through that.

RACHEL:
 i knew it! i knew it. come on tell me your moves.

JOEY:
 oh alright. umm, well, okay, i usually start by having a bottle of wine  sent to my table from a fan.

RACHEL:
 oh my god. and that works?!

JOEY:
 well it does when you combine it with, "this is so embarrassing, i  just want to have a normal life!"

RACHEL:
 oh, you poor little famous man.

JOEY:
 oh okay, how about this one. i was gonna wait until the end of the night  to kiss you, but youre so beautifuli dont think i can.

RACHEL:
   in. i really almost did!

JOEY:
 alright, soso tell me one of your moves.

RACHEL:
 alright. so whered you grow up?

JOEY:
 thats your move? boy rach, youre lucky youre hot.

RACHEL:
 come on, just answer the question!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 and so were-were you close to your parents?

JOEY:
 yeah, with my mom. yeah, not so much with my dad.

RACHEL:
 why not?

JOEY:
 i dont know. i guess theres just always been this distance  yknowi mean we both try to pretend its not there, but it is.

RACHEL:
   gotta be rough.

JOEY:
 yeah, it is. its really tough. yknow sometimes i  thinkwow!! nice move!

RACHEL:
 huh?

JOEY:
 "whered you grow up," its so simple!

RACHEL:
 thank you! and now if youll excuse me, i have to go to the rest  room.

JOEY:
 yeah. 

RACHEL:
 and now youre watching me walk away.

JOEY:
 yes i am! again so simple!   

MONICA:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 you are not going to believe what i did today!

MONICA:
 well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving.

CHANDLER:
 i got good. i played this game all day and now i rule at it! they  should change the name of it to ms. chandler. 

MONICA:
 wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played ms. pac-man  while i went off to work like some kind of chump?!

CHANDLER:
 uh-huh, and i got all the top ten scores, i erased phoebe off the  board! high five!   

MONICA:
 what is the matter with your hand?

CHANDLER:
 well ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen  up. come on, check out the scores. oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty  words.

MONICA:
 chandler, why would you do that?

CHANDLER:
 because its awesome.

MONICA:
 you think this is clever?

CHANDLER:
 well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after a-s-s it  is a bit of a challenge.

MONICA:
 hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty.

CHANDLER:
 it is when you put it together with that one.

MONICA:
 ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one  of those from me. but bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this  cant be there.

CHANDLER:
 come on, he wont even know what they mean.

MONICA:
 chandler! hes seven; hes not stupid.

CHANDLER:
 have you talked to him lately?

MONICA:
 all right, look im just gonna unplug it.

CHANDLER:
 no-no-no, if you unplug it, ill have nothing to show for my day!  it would be like i was at work.   that! look at that, its still there! this thing must have some kind of primitive rom  

MONICA:
 honey you-you got to beat your scores!

CHANDLER:
 with the claw?!

MONICA:
 all right fine. fine, ill do it. ive just got to get this  off the screen. carol and susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.

CHANDLER:
   messed up. 

RACHEL:
 i am not gonna answer that!

JOEY:
 oh come on! just pick one! between monica, phoebe, chandler, and ross if  you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?

RACHEL:
 no one! they are my friends, i wouldnt punch any of them.

JOEY:
 chandler?

RACHEL:
 yeah, but i dont know why. look at me, im having such a  wonderful time!

JOEY:
 me too! hey rach, can i just say i think this is the best date i ever had!

RACHEL:
 i know!

JOEY:
 i never laughed so harddid you see the wine come out of my nose?

RACHEL:
 joey, i think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.

JOEY:
 i gotta say, i never knew i could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so  much.

RACHEL:
 well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.

JOEY:
 huh. huh.

RACHEL:
 all right, now dont judge me. i normally wait until my date  leaves, but you live here. im ripping into this swan.

JOEY:
 ah! okay, well then you dont judge me. im gonna suck on the  cellophane from the brownie i had before. 

RACHEL:
 so tell me, what are joey tribbianis end of the night moves?

JOEY:
 ah, well, if i want the girl to kiss me, first thing i do is make my lips  look irresistible. 

RACHEL:
 how do you do that?

JOEY:
 now you cant tell anyone, but uhi put on shiny lip balm.

RACHEL:
 oh my god!

JOEY:
 yeah, like a moth to a flame, im telling ya. okay all right, so now  you go.

RACHEL:
 no, i dont want to tell you.

JOEY:
 why not?

RACHEL:
 because its embarrassing.

JOEY:
 more embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!    i didnt say raspberry before did i? all right just-just tell me rach, just  tell me!

RACHEL:
   at the door, i lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a  second, and then i make this sound, "hmmm." okay, i know it doesnt sound  like anything, but i swear it works.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 all right, i gotta go to bed. honey, i had such a wonderful time.

JOEY:
 oh.    commercial break 

RACHEL:
 you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!

ROSS:
 no, i ran. it was really far, and when did people stop understanding the  phrase, "get the hell out of my way!"

RACHEL:
 well, why didnt you just take a cab?

ROSS:
 ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets  itll take me twice as long. besides, i teach the class three times a week, who am i?  rockefeller?

RACHEL:
 well youre not gonna be able to keep doing this.

ROSS:
 well i have to. okay? if i dont, theyll take the class away  from me. andi already put it in my family newsletter.

RACHEL:
 you what?

ROSS:
 youve seen it, the geller yeller.

RACHEL:
 right. wow!

ROSS:
 besides, i-i think i figured out a much faster route, im sure i can  make it this time. i justi just cant be afraid to get a little bithit by  cars. 

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi! hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie cujo?  

JOEY:
 oh yeah, i still cant believe you havent seen cujo.  what is wrong with you?

RACHEL:
 relax! its not like its citizen kane!

JOEY:
 have you ever tried to sit through citizen kane?

RACHEL:
 yeah i know its really boring, but its like a big deal.  anyway, i was thinking about renting cujo sometime.

JOEY:
 oh yeah? all right, lets do it tonight.

RACHEL:
 well dont you have that big date tonight?

JOEY:
 oh right!

RACHEL:
 hey joey, can i ask you something?

JOEY:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 after our date last night, did you feel a little weird?

JOEY:
 oh my god! you did too? it totally freaked me out, what was that?!

RACHEL:
 i dont know!   the lobster

JOEY:
 oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i mean i was up sick all night.

JOEY:
 yeah me too, all night.

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 yeah well thats because uhi stayed in my room. yeah, you  dont want to look in my hamper.   

MONICA:
 okay, i got that. ill escape over there. ill come back over  here. all right, come on ms. pac-man. its gotright  well, youre just a little bitch, arent you?

PHOEBE:
   game before  unfortunate initials!

MONICA:
 theyre all chandler.

PHOEBE:
 chandler sucks! he couldnt have gotten this good!

CHANDLER:
 i did. 

MONICA:
 but ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.

CHANDLER:
 oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.    was it just me?! 

ROSS:
 yeah!!!! yes, i made it! im on time!    okay,  why dont we all uh,    where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots. okay,    umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while i     

 hey. are you all right? you seem a little distracted.

JOEY:
 no-no! im fine. its just hey, can i ask you something?  have you ever looked at someone that youve known for a while and then  suddenlysuddenly see them a different way?

 you mean like from behind?

JOEY:
 yeah. yeah, thatthats exactly it. youre right. yeah.

 ew, yknow what? one time i saw this guy from behind and he  seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was stephan baldwin!

JOEY:
   about.

 totally! wow! 

JOEY:
 oh yeah, sure.    ehhh.   

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:
 oh god! thank god youre home! im watching cujo.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 hey, did you get to the part where theyre trapped in the car and  cujos throwin himself at the windshield?

RACHEL:
 no! no! seriously, whats wrong with the dog?! wait a minute, what  are you doing home so early? what happened to your date?

JOEY:
 oh uh, it didnt work out.

RACHEL:
 oh. do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?

JOEY:
 oh uh, okay. yeah.

RACHEL:
 yknow, i never thought id say this about a movie, but i  really hope this dog dies.    what are you doing over there? come sit here, you protect  me.

JOEY:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 i just had the most amazing bath. 

CHANDLER:
 really? i dont like baths. 

MONICA:
 wait, you like them with me. 

CHANDLER:
 honey, its not the bath i enjoy, its the wet, naked lady. 

MONICA:
 oh, baths are so relaxing! 

CHANDLER:
 really? what do you do? you just sit in there stewing in your own filth. 

MONICA:
 how dirty do you think i am? im telling you, if you had some candles  and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! it would take all of your stress away. 

CHANDLER:
 honey, its 2:00 on a wednesday and im watching road rules,  how stressed do you think i am? 

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
 oh! uh, yeah! is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk? 

JOEY:
 well, neither. 

CHANDLER:
 oh my god, whats up?! 

JOEY:
 i dont know. its-its justlately, ive been  feeling okay, heres what it is   better, thanks!  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 in london? 

JOEY:
 yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 yes. when monica and i were in london, we were both in london. 

JOEY:
 you know what? this is a bad idea. forget it. forget it, and listen, do me a  favor, this conversation was between you and me. 

CHANDLER:
 if that.  

RACHEL:
 hi! oh, ross, dont forget, we have that doctors appointment  tomorrow! 

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby? 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 yep! happy and healthy! and cute! 

ROSS:
 and smart! 

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 me too! 

RACHEL:
 really?! 

PHOEBE:
 uh huh! if its a girl, phoebe, and if its a boy, phoebo! 

ROSS:
 maybe. but it wouldnt hurt to have a backup, you know? uh, rach-rach,  what were you thinking?  

RACHEL:
 okay! i was thinking if its a girl, how about sandrine? its  french. 

ROSS:
 huh. thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent. 

RACHEL:
 okay fine, what do you have? 

ROSS:
 well, ok, its for a boy. well, i know its a little out there,  butdarwin. 

RACHEL:
 wow, oh my god, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, by sandrine. 

ROSS:
 youre just saying that 'cause i said no to your name! 

RACHEL:
 im really, really not. 

PHOEBE:
 how-how about you each get five vetoes? 

ROSS:
 all right. 

RACHEL:
 all right. 

ROSS:
 that sounds fair. 

RACHEL:
 yeah! i dont think youre going to need it though. okay, check  this out. if its a girl, rain. 

ROSS:
 veto. 

RACHEL:
 why? 

ROSS:
 rain? hi. hi, my name is rain. i have my own kiln, and my dress is made out  of wheat. 

PHOEBE:
 i know her! i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show! 

ROSS:
 okay, how about, for a guy, thatcher? 

RACHEL:
 ross, why do you hate our child? 

ROSS:
 fine, you go. 

RACHEL:
 okay, james. 

ROSS:
 huh. 

RACHEL:
 but only if its a girl. 

ROSS:
 oh, veto. how aboutooh, i like ruth! what about ruth? 

RACHEL:
 oh! im sorry! are we having an 89-year-old? how about dayton? 

ROSS:
 veto. stewart? 

RACHEL:
 veto. sawyer? 

ROSS:
 veto. helen? 

RACHEL:
 veto. 

PHOEBE:
 is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?  

CHANDLER:
 hey. 

MONICA:
 boy, do i have a surprise for you! 

CHANDLER:
 sex on the balcony? 

MONICA:
 no, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they? 

CHANDLER:
 what is it? 

MONICA:
 i drew you a bath! 

CHANDLER:
 honey, i dont like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having  sex on the balcony? 

MONICA:
 please, could you just try it for me? come on, i used all my best stuff!  i-i-i lit some candles. i put on some music. i used bath salts, plus bubble bath! and got  you this little plastic navy ship. so its a boy bath! 

CHANDLER:
 well, this does butch it up a bit. 

MONICA:
 i swear, if you try it, you will love it! 

CHANDLER:
 all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony? 

MONICA:
 absolutely.  

MONICA:
 bet i know how that discussions going to go.    

CHANDLER:
   smell! which is okay, because ive got my boat. 

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 oh my god. 

MONICA:
 i told you you were a bath person! hey, when you get out, maybe i can give you  a facial! 

CHANDLER:
 im going to need a bigger boat.    

ROSS:
 i dont think you had an open mind about the name ruth. i mean, come on,  little ruthie geller, how-how cute is that? 

RACHEL:
 oh, oh my god! i can practically hear the mahjong tiles! 

 okay! all your tests look fine. now, are you two interested in knowing  the sex of the baby? 

ROSS:
 uh, no. no, were not. 

RACHEL:
 but you have it right there in that file? you could tell us whether  its a boy or a girl? dayton or sandrine? phoebe or phoebo? 

 thats right. but if you dont want to know 

ROSS:
 no, no, we want to wait, right? 

RACHEL:
 right. right. 

   its really not my place, but please dont name your child phoebo. 

RACHEL:
   babies do you think is the ugliest? 

ROSS:
 what? rach! come on, thats terrible!  theyreuhtheyre babies. theyre-theyre all beautiful. 

RACHEL:
 third one from the left? 

ROSS:
 yeah, why is it staring at me? i think it knows im talking about it.   

RACHEL:
 what?!  

ROSS:
 youre looking! 

RACHEL:
 i didnt! 

ROSS:
 i saw you! 

RACHEL:
 okay fine, i did. but i didnt see anything, i swear. 

ROSS:
 shame on you! ugly baby judges you! 

RACHEL:
 okay, but ross just listen to me 

ROSS:
 no, no, no, no! dont tell me! i dont want to know! 

RACHEL:
 but i couldnt even if i wanted to, because i dont know! i  swear; i didnt see anything, and i dont want to know! it was just a momentary  lapse. 

ROSS:
 momentary lapse. dont-dont you have any self-control? 

RACHEL:
   

MONICA:
 hello? 

CHANDLER:
 im in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think theres  something wrong. 

MONICA:
 you know what? i-i think ill wait out here.  

CHANDLER:
 im in the bathtub. 

MONICA:
 oh.  

CHANDLER:
 i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the waters tepid. the salt  didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. and the scents i used dont  compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomileoh! 

MONICA:
 what? 

CHANDLER:
 the bath salts! theyre starting to effervesce! its different.   

MONICA:
 okay, lets talk about something else. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh-oh-oh! 

MONICA:
 well, i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey. he was talking  about rules and right and wrong and 

CHANDLER:
 i had the exact same conversation. 

MONICA:
 you did? what was he talking about? 

CHANDLER:
 i dont know! joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out  words since we saw him in macbeth! 

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 all right, lets break this down. what exactly did he say to you? 

MONICA:
 okay, he was talking about rules. 

CHANDLER:
 uh-huh. 

MONICA:
 umm, and looking at people differently. 

CHANDLER:
 he didnt say anything about that to me. 

MONICA:
 what did he tell you? 

CHANDLER:
 he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of  course the glue that holds this all together, the rules. 

MONICA:
 okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants  to do what you and i did in london with someone. 

CHANDLER:
 but what did he mean by rules? 

MONICA:
 wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in! 

CHANDLER:
 because he was looking at her differently. 

MONICA:
 and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules! 

CHANDLER:
 my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london! 

PHOEBE:
  

MONICA:
 just a minute!  

CHANDLER:
 you dont say anything. 

MONICA:
 why would i say anything? that two of our best friends could start the  greatest love affair of their lives! and they would have me to thank, and we could all  start having babies? 

CHANDLER:
 im not going to let you say anything. 

MONICA:
 you just stay here!  

CHANDLER:
 oh, god!  

PHOEBE:
 oh, hey, monica, i brought back your iron. 

MONICA:
 oh, you had that?  

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh. 

MONICA:
 i thought i lost it. i got a new one, like, a month ago. 

PHOEBE:
 oh, just as well, i broke this one.  

PHOEBE:
 what? 

MONICA:
 nothing. 

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 i mean, i-i, i really shouldnt say. i mean, im really not  supposed to. 

PHOEBE:
 fine. 

MONICA:
 its a humdinger! 

PHOEBE:
 then its really too bad that you cant tell me. 

MONICA:
 somebody likes you! 

PHOEBE:
  

MONICA:
 no! 

PHOEBE:
 well, then tell him to stop staring! 

MONICA:
 its joey! 

PHOEBE:
 really?! joey?! you dont say. 

MONICA:
 is it something youd be interested in? 

PHOEBE:
 i dont know, i dont know, i dont know. you know, i mean,  on the one hand, mother may i? but yknow on the other hand no. no, i  cant. were friends. no, oh, no. i dont want to risk what we have. 

MONICA:
 i guess that makes sense. so, you think youre going to talk to him? 

PHOEBE:
 sure, yeah. i mean, its joey. i dont want him to get hurt.  well, i must say, i am on fire! first chandler, now joey! 

MONICA:
 not chandler, just joey. 

PHOEBE:
 sure.  commercial break   

RACHEL:
 hey. 

ROSS:
 hey. 

RACHEL:
 you know what? ive been thinking about it. im really coming  around on the name ruth. i think i would actually consider naming our child that. 

ROSS:
 rach, i-i cant tell you how-how much that means to me! ohh wait a  minute. wait a minute. you-you hated the name ruth! why-why would you change your mind?  unless, you know were never going to have to use it. you did see the folder. you  know its a boy! 

RACHEL:
 i didnt see anything! i actually changed my mind about the name. 

ROSS:
 i dont think so! youre just giving me ruth so youll get to  name it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him heath  or blaine or sequoia. 

RACHEL:
 i wouldsequoia? 

ROSS:
 veto. 

RACHEL:
 fine. 

ROSS:
 unless   this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named  ruth! well, im not falling for that! okay? ruth is off the table! 

RACHEL:
 but ross, you want the name ruth! 

ROSS:
 not like this!  

PHOEBE:
 hey. 

JOEY:
 hey. well, whats up? 

PHOEBE:
 umm, joey, i know. 

JOEY:
 what? 

PHOEBE:
 i knooow. 

JOEY:
 whaaat? 

PHOEBE:
 i know about your feelings. 

JOEY:
 oh my god. you do? 

PHOEBE:
 yes, and im sorry. i-i know things worked out for chandler and  monica, but thats very rare. 

JOEY:
 i know. i know. and this is so much more complicated than it was for those  guys. i mean, its rachel for god sakes. 

PHOEBE:
 for god sakes, its rachel! 

JOEY:
 i know. i know. and shes not only my friend; shes my pregnant  friend! shes my pregnant friend whos ross ex! 

PHOEBE:
 yeah thats rachel.  

JOEY:
 what am i going to do? you know, and i keep, i keep trying to get rid of  these feelings, yknow? i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i  dont like about her. you want to hear it? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah. 

JOEY:
 she made me switch to light mayo. thats it! thats all i got! and,  you know what? it tastes the same and my pants fit better! 

PHOEBE:
 joey, i just think youre getting worked up over nothing. this is  probably just a crush. 

JOEY:
 you think? 

PHOEBE:
 absolutely! yknow, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes  away. 

JOEY:
 yeah, just a crush! thats all this is! its a crush! im  joey; i dont get deep feelings. 

PHOEBE:
 thats right, there you go! crushes happen all the time! i know  ive had them for all you guys. well, except for ross and chandler. and im sure  youve had them for us. 

JOEY:
 not really. 

PHOEBE:
 mm-hmm.   

ROSS:
 so, i uh i called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby. 

RACHEL:
 what? 

ROSS:
 thats right. the student has become the master. 

RACHEL:
 ross, i swear, i dont know. 

ROSS:
 oh, come on, you know its a girl! 

RACHEL:
 a what?! 

ROSS:
 you really didnt know? 

RACHEL:
 were having a girl? 

ROSS:
 no. 

RACHEL:
 thats what you just said! 

ROSS:
 no. 

RACHEL:
 you said girl! 

ROSS:
 yes. im im sorry. im so sorry. 

RACHEL:
 im not! were having a girl! sometimes i cant believe  its with youbut still! were having a girl! 

ROSS:
 i know! i know. you know what? im putting ruth back on the table! 

RACHEL:
 oh, yes! well have ourselves a little baby ruth 

ROSS:
 permission to veto. 

RACHEL:
 yes, please.  

MONICA:
 hey. 

CHANDLER:
 do i smell essential oils? 

MONICA:
 yeah, im going to take a bath. im just going to get a magazine. 

CHANDLER:
 okay.    

MONICA:
 what do you think youre doing? 

CHANDLER:
 l-leaving my troubles behind? 

MONICA:
 i know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable  bath decorum. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed. 

MONICA:
 fine, you can have the bath, but i am taking your boat. now youre  just a girl in a tub!  

CHANDLER:
  

PHOEBE:
 hi, bubbles. manly. well, i just thought i would drop by and let you know  how it went with joey. 

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 she pulled it out of me! shes like a conversational wizard!  howd it go? 

PHOEBE:
 well, you were wrong, he doesnt like me! 

MONICA:
 what? 

PHOEBE:
 yeah! how would you like it if i sent you to lee majors house and  told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didnt  like you? how would you feel? 

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 really? lee majors is hot! 

JOEY:
  

PHOEBE:
 were in the bathroom! 

JOEY:
 why? 

CHANDLER:
  

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 oh my god! a friend hes looking at differently, but its wrong.  its rachel! 

CHANDLER:
 you like rachel?! 

JOEY:
 its no big deal, okay? phoebe and i talked about it. its just a  crush! its going to go away!   oh! 

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
   here?    

MONICA:
 honey, cover it up with the boat! 

ROSS:
  

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
   oh, no.   hey, did you, did you tell them? 

RACHEL:
 no, i was waiting for you! 

PHOEBE:
 tell us what? 

RACHEL:
 were having a girl. 

 oh, wow! yay! wow! hooray! oh, man!  

CHANDLER:
 illill get you later!  

JOEY:
   crush, thats all! just a little crush! all that worrying i was doing,  that was crazy. crazy! like my friend here the bird would say, "it  was cuckoo!" everythings going to be fine. its just a crush. 

RACHEL:
  

JOEY:
   closing credits     

MONICA:
 it sure is nice to do this together, isnt it? 

CHANDLER:
 yeah. and what youre doing feels so good. 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 thats always appropriate!  more push! one more push! 

 oh, here is your beautiful baby. congratulations!   

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 oh thats amazing. 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 whoa-hey-oh! sorry!  

CHANDLER:
 hey babe.

MONICA:
 hi honey. we just got a wedding gift from bob and faye bing; they dont like us do they? 

CHANDLER:
 who says you cant get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? maybe we can take it back?

MONICA:
 no, it doesnt say where it came from. where would we return it?

CHANDLER:
 how about to the street say from the balcony?

MONICA:
 why dont we just find a place for it?

CHANDLER:
 okay. how about in that cabinet?

MONICA:
 no! thats where we keep the canned goods! have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?

CHANDLER:
 how about the closet by the bathroom?  

MONICA:
 oh, okay. here, why dont you let me do it?

CHANDLER:
 oh no-no-no, i will do it. honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  its locked, you have to help me. why is it locked?

MONICA:
 no reason. i-i keep private things in there.

CHANDLER:
 oh yknow, ive been living here a while and ive never seen whats inside that closet. what is, what is in there?

MONICA:
 feminine stuff.

CHANDLER:
 dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!

MONICA:
 chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! if you love me you-youll let it go.

CHANDLER:
 fine.

MONICA:
 thank you! 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 phoebe if it helps alexandra has only been massaging monica for like three years.  "if it helps!" 

PHOEBE:
 why wont you let me massage you?

MONICA:
 well itsi mean id justid be self-conscious. youre my friend; id be naked.

PHOEBE:
 monica! we lived together for years! ive seen you naked!

MONICA:
 thats different, we were roommates! and when?!

PHOEBE:
 im curious about the human body.

MONICA:
 hey, come on phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.

PHOEBE:
 but im a professional! and im really good! look, if youre uncomfortable we can stop. just give me a chance, okay. please?

MONICA:
 okay, if it means that much to you

PHOEBE:
 it does! how would you feel if you couldnt share your cooking? or-or imagine how ross would feel if he couldnt teach us about dragons.

MONICA:
 dinosaurs.

PHOEBE:
 potato, potaato.  

ROSS:
 hey!

JOEY:
 hey ross! the babys kicking!

ROSS:
 what?! it is?!  trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs 

RACHEL:
 its not kicking right now. although we would love to see you do 

ROSS:
 hey, when-when was it kicking? what happened?

RACHEL:
 last night! i just felt it and i went into joeys room and he was sleeping

JOEY:
 a dreamless sleep.

ROSS:
 my god, the babys kicking. thats great. although ikinda wish i-i wouldve been there to feel the kicking for the first time yknow.

JOEY:
 well i got stuff going on in here 

ROSS:
 look, i-i dont want to miss anymore baby stuff. sohere. heres my new pager number, okay? anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! ill be there! okay? i dont care if its three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.

JOEY:
 wow! can i get a copy of that? 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 yes.  

PHOEBE:
  hows the pressure?

MONICA:
 nice! wow phoebe you are good!

PHOEBE:
 stating the obvious, but thank you. and its not weird is it.

MONICA:
 no. ooohh

PHOEBE:
 thats right, you just enjoy.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 oh god phoebe!!  it! right there! oh!    

CHANDLER:
 i wasnt trying to open your closet! i wasnt trying to open your closet! i swear! 

JOEY:
 whoa, monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it.

JOEY:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 i dont know! what could she possibly be hiding in here that i cant see?!

JOEY:
 i dont know. ooh, i bet its richard.

CHANDLER:
 why would monica be keeping richard in here?

JOEY:
 well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. you being the cake and richard being the too. or!

CHANDLER:
 and here we go

JOEY:
 i saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy!   stupid closet full of bugs!

RACHEL:
 joey. joey, something feels weird and not good weird. i dontwhoa!! 

JOEY:
 oh hey whoa-whoa, dont worry. okay. when my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.

RACHEL:
 really?

JOEY:
 absolutely. but, were gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? ill page ross on the way. come on.

RACHEL:
 okay. oh godow!oo!

JOEY:
 okay rach-rach-rach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna be fine, trust me. okay. take my hand. here we go.  bones!  

JOEY:
 hey! so?

 shes fine. shes experiencing braxton-hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.

RACHEL:
 hmm, mild discomfort. so i take it youve had one of these braxton thingies?

JOEY:
 so but everything is normal.

 absolutely.

JOEY:
 and-and theres no danger to her and the baby?

 no-no. contractions can be unnerving if you dont know what they are, but shes fine.

RACHEL:
 thank you doctor.  nice and calm.

JOEY:
 calm?! i wasnt calm! ive never been more scared in all my life!

RACHEL:
 but wait you said everything was gonna be okay.

JOEY:
 well what do i know?! im not a doctor!

RACHEL:
 but ibut everything is okay. im fine!

JOEY:
 you sure?!

RACHEL:
 yes! yes! i got half a mind to contract that doctors uterus though. mild discomfort, whats he talking about?

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 yeah, everythings fine!

ROSS:
 your page said come to the hospital, what? what was it? what happened?

JOEY:
 something called braxton-hicks contractions.

ROSS:
 oh. oh. thank god, most women dont even feel them.

RACHEL:
 okay, no uterus, no opinion.

JOEY:
 hey uh, whats with the candy?

ROSS:
 oh when you beeped me i was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.

RACHEL:
 oh you went to the movies by yourself?

ROSS:
 no imona!

RACHEL:
 oh, i gotta go back in there.

ROSS:
 what? why? whats wrong?

RACHEL:
 no, everythings fine. i just gotta go back

ROSS:
 no really, you tell me whats up.

RACHEL:
 i-i forgot my underwear. 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 oh hey, dont worry about it man. dont worry about it, no big deal.

ROSS:
 yeah but still, i mean it shouldve been me. im the dad.

  on braxton-hicks.  bringing her in. youre gonna make a wonderful father.

JOEY:
 oh uh, hey. not as good as this guy!  brought twizlers! commercial break 

CHANDLER:
 there has got to be a way!

JOEY:
 easy there captain kirk. oh, do you have a bobby pin?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.  girl.

JOEY:
 then why do you throw like one?

CHANDLER:
 maybe monica has a bobby pin.

JOEY:
 sure. "monica."

CHANDLER:
 so, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming?

JOEY:
 uh, really good. really good. yeah, i should be ready to kill myself any day now.  that quick.  about rachel anymore, yknow? i wish things could go back to normal. i mean, i love living with her and god, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now i thinki think ross feels left out. yknow? when i had to take rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought i was the father. god you shouldve seen the look on rosss face.  just locking it more. oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?

CHANDLER:
 thats a good idea.

JOEY:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 okay.  ross is kinda bummed huh?

JOEY:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 what?! youre crazy! theres nothing sexual about the noises i make!

PHOEBE:
 really? theres nothing sexual about this?  ohh. ohhhh. ohh.  

MONICA:
 oh mythis is so embarrassing. oh my god, im never gonna get massaged again!

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
  okay?

RACHEL:
 yeah, ill be fine. but could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when i get out there?

JOEY:
 im on it! 

ROSS:
 i cant believe this! i shouldnt be the one making her throw up!

JOEY:
 dude relax! it could happen to anyone.

ROSS:
 yeah? not to you, because you know this stuff. i dont know any of it and im the father. i wish id be more involved yknow.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 hey uh, can i, can i talk to you guys for a second?

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 maybe you two should live together.

RACHEL:
 are you asking me to move out? do you not want me here?

JOEY:
 oh no-no, no-no i love living with you. it just seems thatif youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.

RACHEL:
 but joey, i dont think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. i mean he does.

ROSS:
 no i-i-i would love to be around for you and the baby. and we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.

RACHEL:
 but ross, its you and me!

ROSS:
 so? sure! but it-it wouldnt be anything romantic. and im-im dating monadamnit mona! i was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! what is wrong with me?!

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 i dont know. is it crazy?

ROSS:
 no! no its not. joey, this is a smart idea.

JOEY:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 so rachels all moved out huh? how are you taking it?

JOEY:
 well uh, i wanted to have a few beers, but uh, i got rid of those because rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. but i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. and uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick.

CHANDLER:
 are you okay?

JOEY:
 are you kidding me? im great! yeah, im uh; im better than great. i am good. and now that shes gone, i can uh, i can do all this stuff around here that i couldnt do before. yknow? like umm, i can walk around naked again. yknow? i can uh, i can watch porn in the living room. right? this is uh, this is good for me. yknow? i like being on my own, im uh, better off this way. im uh, a lone wolf. yknow? a loner. alone. all alone. forever. whats a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!  closing credits

 we have red bagels. 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 oh, im actually on my way to tell her right now. yeah, shes been away all week visiting her parents, but shell be cool. i mean, shes been so supportive. she-she even got the baby a tiny t-shirt that says, fossils are my friends. 

PHOEBE:
 ugh. come on, mona, dont kiss ass. 

ROSS:
 uh, im going to take off. 

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 you dont want my opinion? 

MONICA:
 not really. 

ROSS:
 come on, im your older brother, ask me! 

MONICA:

ROSS:
    

PHOEBE:
  lately, so i brought someone over to cheer you up. right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate. 

JOEY:

RACHEL:
  

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 i accidentally packed these with my stuff.  is this? 

JOEY:
 oh, thats, uh, thats phoebes friends dog. i dont know what his real name is, but i call him mozzarella. 

RACHEL:
   oh, well, you are so cute! i wish i could play with you more, but ive got to go to work! i hope i stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes i do. yes i do.  

JOEY:
  the one who used to live here. might as well be honest with youwe love her. but we cant have her. i really miss her. well, hey, you understand, right? youre a guy.    

MONICA:
   

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 what is it? 

CHANDLER:
 its yellingbleedingdilating. oh, the dilating 

MONICA:
 is this the video of the baby being born? sweetie, this is phoebes. why were you even watching it? 

CHANDLER:
 i thoughtmaybeyou got me porn for valentines day. 

MONICA:
 chandler, if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentines day  young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! yeah, it got four starts!  arent stars. anyway, you want to take a look? 

CHANDLER:
 well, im not really in a sexy mood right now. 

MONICA:
 honey, whats going on? 

CHANDLER:
 well, remember the first time we saw jaws? 

MONICA:
 mm-hmm. 

CHANDLER:
 how long it took to go back in the water? 

MONICA:
 chandler, we cant let this tape wreck valentines day! 

CHANDLER:
 you dont know. you didnt see it. 

MONICA:
 child-birth, its a natural thing! its beautiful. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, beautiful? really? beautiful? you think this is beautiful?  the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like  

MONICA:
 oh! oh, my god! no wonder my mother hates me! 

CHANDLER:
 see, honey, theres 

MONICA:
 dont touch me!  

 hi! 

ROSS:
 hey!  

 good. 

ROSS:
 yeah? 

 i brought you back a present. 

ROSS:
 wha? oh, come on. you didnt have tosaltwater taffy?!   thanks! this is interesting. you know, most people think this is made with sea water, but its actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. thats not interesting. 

 i think its interesting. 

ROSS:
 i do too! i missed you! 

 i missed you, too! so, how was your week? 

ROSS:
 oh, it was good! it was good. actually, the baby started kicking! 

 how exciting! 

ROSS:
 yeah! i know! it was. oh the only sad thing is i wasnt around when it happened for the first time. 

 oh no. 

ROSS:
 yeah, im missing out on all this other stuff, too. so, joey suggested rachel move in with me. 

  

ROSS:
 what? 

 joey cracks me up! its like, yeah, why dont you have your ex-wife move in with you? that wouldnt be awkward at all!  

ROSS:
  

 huh, could you imagine. i go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!    

 so, whatd you tell him? 

ROSS:
    commercial break   

PHOEBE:
 how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you? 

ROSS:
 i dont know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy! 

PHOEBE:
 taffy, really? ive never had any. 

ROSS:
 ever?! 

PHOEBE:
 well, i think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  tell her? 

ROSS:
 oh, no, no, no, i will! i just want to butter her up, first! you know, im going to take her to an amazing valentines dinner. do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks im the best boyfriend in the world, then im going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me. 

PHOEBE:
 if i havent said it before: shes a lucky, lucky lady! so, where are you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff?   oh, god. is it gum, is it food? whats the deal?    

JOEY:
 so, between her and me being friends, and her history with ross, it just isnt going to happen. it would be like you falling in love with a cat. 

PHOEBE:
  

JOEY:
 hey. 

PHOEBE:
 hey, buddy. hows my favorite dog, huh? hows my favorite dog?  

JOEY:
 no. 

PHOEBE:
 will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment. 

JOEY:
 yeah, sure. go ahead.   

PHOEBE:
 hes miserable! what happened to him? 

JOEY:
 nothing. we just talked about stuff. 

PHOEBE:
 what stuff? 

JOEY:
 rachel stuff. 

PHOEBE:
 ohjoey, you bummed him out! this was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him! 

JOEY:
 hes breathing! 

PHOEBE:
 okay, im going to take him back to wendys. 

JOEY:
 no, no, no, no! hes fine! look, look, look!  heres your ball! get your ball! get your ball!   get your ball! my god, what have i done to you, huh? i broke the dog! pheebs, i broke the dog!   

ROSS:
 well, im, uh, going to pick up mona. what have you got going tonight? 

RACHEL:
 oh, ive got big valentines plans! ive got my chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy! 

ROSS:
 yknow, its interesting! most people think thats made with seawater, when in fact 

RACHEL:
 ross, we actually watched the documentary together.  

RACHEL:
 ooh! my chinese food! let me get my cash!   

ROSS:
  are you doing here? im, um, supposed to pick you up! 

 change of plans, i made you a special valentines dinner! surprise! 

ROSS:
  ayyyayyyy! 

RACHEL:
  

 hi! hi. hi, rachel!  

ROSS:
 i have no idea! 

RACHEL:
 ill be watching tv if anybody needs me.  

 seriously, what is she doing? 

ROSS:
 uhlately, she just likes hanging out here. 

 why? 

ROSS:
 i think shes lonely. 

 okay, but its valentines day! 

ROSS:
 i know. 

 cant we just ask her to go? 

ROSS:
 no, no. shes way to emotional. and by emotional i mean crazy.  

RACHEL:
 im not here! thats just my chinese food! 

 oh, my god! she has food delivered here? 

ROSS:
 mm-hmm. shesshes emotional, but, but ballsy. 

RACHEL:
 you know what im going to do? im going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!  

ROSS:
 and you thought she was going to be in our way! so, why dont you, uh, open the champagne, and ill be right back. ive got a surprise for you. 

 you got another ex-wife back there? 

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
  

 oh, rachel! wait! hey, i hope you dont take this the wrong way, but, but, um what are you doing? 

RACHEL:
 oh, im sorry! do you need the phone? 

 no, no. listen, ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why dont you go back to your place and give us some privacy? 

RACHEL:
  

ROSS:
  remember me by.   

MONICA:
 how long has it been this time? 

CHANDLER:
 90 seconds. 

MONICA:
 thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about itexcept all i did was think about it. 

CHANDLER:
 you know, it haunts me? up til now, the worst thing i ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. after this, i would gladly make that my screensaver! 

MONICA:
 okay, well, we have to get past this! why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed? 

CHANDLER:
 i can do that. 

MONICA:
 okay.  

CHANDLER:
 okay. now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.  back up. they move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone  

MONICA:
 oh, thank god! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, i know! 

MONICA:
 come in! 

RACHEL:
  i had to get away from all the yelling. mona is dumping ross. 

MONICA:
 oh, my god. 

CHANDLER:
 poor ross.   

CHANDLER:
 oh, great. we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes! 

MONICA:
 rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? its here. 

CHANDLER:
 oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: dont watch it. 

RACHEL:
 why? you saw it? is it scary? 

CHANDLER:
 well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself. 

RACHEL:
 well, now, wait. now im all freaked out. come on, you guys will watch it with me. 

MONICA:
 no, but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you! 

RACHEL:
 cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watch this alone! 

MONICA:
 shes rightof course not. honey, get the tape. 

CHANDLER:
  reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.   okay, here we go. 

RACHEL:
 okay.   woah! why is that baby torturing that woman?! 

CHANDLER:
 why have i seen this thing three times?! 

MONICA:
 itsstill beautiful. 

RACHEL:
 uh! its horrible! 

MONICA:
 i know! i know, im so sorry for you! 

RACHEL:
 oh, my god!  

CHANDLER:
 wait, you guys, look! 

RACHEL:
 what? did her ass explode?! 

CHANDLER:
 no, the babys out! look, look! 

MONICA:
 oh, look at those little fingers and toes! 

CHANDLER:
 and look how happy the mom is now! 

MONICA:
 ohrach! 

RACHEL:
 oh, screw you guys, you dont have to do it!  some back area of central perk around the corner that weve never seen!  

ROSS:
 hey, hey, man! 

JOEY:
 hey, whats up? 

ROSS:
 uhmona just dumped me. 

JOEY:
 oh, man, im sorry. why? 

ROSS:
 well, with everything thats been going on lately, i havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. you know, i, uh, i didnt tell her i got rachel pregnant. i gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me. in a way, i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know? 

JOEY:
 still, that really sucks, man. especially on valentines day. 

ROSS:
 yeah. wait a minute. what are you doing here? joey tribbiani without a date on valentines day? whats going on, huh? girl trouble? 

JOEY:
 sort of. 

ROSS:
 really?! 

JOEY:
 you dont have to seem so happy about it. 

ROSS:
 oh, sorry. well, look, maybe i can help you with it. 

JOEY:
 oh, ii d 

ROSS:
 hey, whatever it is, i am sure it has happened to me. yknow, actually onceonce i got dumped during sex.   

ROSS:
 anyway, so, uh, so what is it? 

JOEY:
 forget about it. its no big deal. 

ROSS:
 cmon! joey! what is it? 

JOEY:
 its nothing. 

ROSS:
 hey, hey, its me. why cant you tell me? 

JOEY:
 okay, uhsit down.  like. a lot. but, uhit cant happen. 

ROSS:
 shes not a tribbiani? 

JOEY:
 no! 

ROSS:
 i knew it. so, is she someone from work? 

JOEY:
 yes. 

ROSS:
 well, uh, does she like you? 

JOEY:
 sometimes i think maybe she could. but it doesnt matter, because i cant do anything about it. 

ROSS:
 why not? 

JOEY:
 well, its complicated. shes with this other guy. for a long time. someone from work, too. and i could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends. 

ROSS:
 so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her? 

JOEY:
 no. i dont think so. 

ROSS:
 okay. um is he a good guy? 

JOEY:
 yeah, hes the best. 

ROSS:
 then talk to him! he might be fine with it. 

JOEY:
 oh, i dont know. 

ROSS:
 joey, its worth finding out. i mean, if you really like her. 

JOEY:
 i do! so much! i cant stop thinking about her! i cant sleep, i 

ROSS:
 okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself. 

  

ROSS:
 im going touhim going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home. 

JOEY:
 oh, yeah. 

ROSS:
 anyway seriously, uhjustjust talk to the guy, okay? and tell me how it goes.  

JOEY:
 its rachel.    closing credits   

RACHEL:
  prepared. now, youre going to make yourself watch the whole thing. just do it!  

 i came to the big city to become a star! ill doanything to make that happen! 

 anything?  

JOEY:
 theres this woman, that i like.  a lot.  well, its complicated.  shes with this other guy.  for a long time.  and i could never do that to the guy, yknow?  ccause were really good friends. 

ROSS:
 so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy? 

JOEY:
 yeah, hes the best. 

ROSS:
 then talk to him! he might be fine with it. 

JOEY:
 oh, i dont know. 

ROSS:
 joey, its worth finding out. i mean, if you really like her. 

JOEY:
 i do! so much! i cant stop thinking about her! i cant sleep, i 

ROSS:
 okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself.  

JOEY:

ROSS:
  its rachel?

JOEY:
 yes.

ROSS:
 um, youyou like rachel?

JOEY:
 yes. i like rachel.

ROSS:
 rachel?!

JOEY:
  yknow who else i like? you! and it-it doesnt get said enough. i like you ross.

ROSS:
 but r-r-rachel-rachel?! 

JOEY:
 yeah, but its not a big deal.

ROSS:
 its not a big deal? oh, im sorry i justum, iwhat about all the stuff you-you just said? i mean how about, i likeyou-you cant stop thinking about her. like how you cant sleep?

JOEY:
 im an actor, yknow? as-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.

ROSS:
 rachel whos carrying my baby? rachel?

JOEY:
 look no, i-i know its bad, and i know its wrong. okay? but-but its not like anythings ever gonna happen. yknow? these-these are just feelings, theyre gonna go away.

ROSS:
 yknow what? i-i gotta go.

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?

RACHEL:
 oh yes i do. i do. i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. and do you know how you find him? you stop looking for him. thats why i stopped looking for russell crowe. hell find me.

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh, 

CHANDLER:
 no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i dont think they exist.

PHOEBE:
 okay, good.

CHANDLER:
 why?

PHOEBE:
 well last night, i met monicas.

CHANDLER:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half.

CHANDLER:
 come on, dont be crazy.  theres someone out there better suited for monica than me, do ya?  

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 well hes tall.

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.

PHOEBE:
 he has brown hair.

RACHEL:
 of course, of course.

CHANDLER:
 a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!

PHOEBE:
 he works with food!

RACHEL:
 oh sure. older?

PHOEBE:
 obviously, and hes british.

RACHEL:
 oh, i was just gonna ask!

PHOEBE:
 yeah? and, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident.

RACHEL:
 oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.

CHANDLER:
 luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.

PHOEBE:
 oh, im so sorry. um, and maybe im wrong! i butyknow im gonna go out with him again, ill find out more.

CHANDLER:
 you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?

PHOEBE:
 well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat. 

MONICA:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey.

MONICA:
 i just talked to joey, i justi want to see how you were.

ROSS:
 oh yknow, i stilli cant believe it. joey and rachel i mean its its like you and me going out, only weirder!

MONICA:
 all right, i know youre hurting, and-and i want to be supportive, but dont say that again.

ROSS:
 oh my god! what if, what if they get married? then hed be the stepfather of my child.

MONICA:
 honey, i dont think thats something we need to worry about! first of all hes-hes never gonna tell her how he feels about her. and even if he did you have no idea how shed react.

ROSS:
 sure, because women never like joey. yknow, i think hes a virgin.

MONICA:
 joeyhes not even thinking about going after rachel!

ROSS:
 hes not?

MONICA:
 no! all hes thinking about is how youre taking this! i mean, listen its totally freaking him out. hes talking about moving to vermont.

ROSS:
 why?

MONICA:
 he says he wants to leave the country. 

ROSS:
 hate him? i no, i dont hate him.  its rachel, yknow?

MONICA:
 honey i cant even imagine how hard this must be for you. but, i dont want you to lose joey over it. and right now he just needs to know that youre still his friend.

ROSS:
 okay. okay, ill talk to him.

MONICA:
 all right. now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money.  

PHOEBE:
 oh! hi!

MONICA:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 umm, chandler, monica, this is don.

 oh, hello.  

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 so, what have you guys been doing?

 well, we just had a terrible lunch today at reattica. what is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?

MONICA:
 i know! what is this, 1985?!

 thats exactly what i said. phoebe, isnt that strange.

MONICA:
 not really.

CHANDLER:
 whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  on a barbecue chicken pizza? 

MONICA:
 so don, what-what other restaurants do you like?

 well, octavio, 27&7oh! and theres this great little place, alessandros.

MONICA:
 oh my god! thats my restaurant, im the chef there.

 youre kidding me!

MONICA:
 no!

 your food is fantastic! wow, i really want to talk to you about your menu, once i get some coffees first. um, anyone want any?

MONICA:
 oh, id like a latte. oh yknow what? if youre gonna talk about me, im gonna go with you.  

CHANDLER:
 what are you doing?!

PHOEBE:
 nothing! i swear to god i didnt know you guys would be here! and the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. so

CHANDLER:
 i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!

PHOEBE:
 theyre just talking, and yknow what? just because i think theyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

MONICA:
 yeah! oh hes great, i love him.  

PHOEBE:
 dont worry, well find you someone else.  

JOEY:
 hey.

ROSS:
 hey.

JOEY:
 look, i understand if you came by to hit me, i deserve it.

ROSS:
 no, i dont want to hit you.

JOEY:
 oh what then? kick me?

ROSS:
 no.

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 no, no i dont want to do anything to you. all right? i just want to tell you that im not mad at you andand that i certainly do not hate you. i just, i just came here to say that. 

JOEY:
 oh nowhey ross-ross! do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?

ROSS:
 uhyeah sure. 

JOEY:
 do uh, do you got any beer? all-all i got is this melon stuff that rachel left. i dont

ROSS:
 okay.

JOEY:
  okay? i uhi am never gonna act on this rachel thing, okay? i-i would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. 

ROSS:
 thank you.  

JOEY:
 anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get over her, thats all. im not even sure how to do that, i mean ive never been in love before so

ROSS:
 what?! youre in love with her.

JOEY:
 yeah, i thought you knew that.

ROSS:
 umm, no.

JOEY:
 wow. hey look, if it helps, i dont want to feel this way. honest. i just keep thinking, "ah, ill get over this." yknow? i justit just keeps gettin harder. i dont, i dont know what to do. yknow? what do i do? 

ROSS:
 i think you need to tell her how you feel.

JOEY:
 okay thats the green stuff talkin.

ROSS:
 no, im serious. you-you need to find out where she is, because if shes not where you are, then you can start to move past this.

JOEY:
 but what if uhand im not saying she will bebut

ROSS:
 if she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it shouldnt stand in the way.

JOEY:
 are you sure?

ROSS:
 yeah. look if-if shes gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldnt find a better guy. so

JOEY:
 hey thanks.

ROSS:
 so when do you think youre gonna talk to her?

JOEY:
 oh my god i have to tell her! i havent even thought about what i will say. what should i say?

ROSS:
 im understanding, but lets not get carried away.

JOEY:
 im sorry, youre right. what am i gonna say?   oh!

ROSS:
 yeah, tell me about it.   commercial break 

 so ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.

CHANDLER:
 cheese you say? thats some pretty smelly work, huh don?

 excuse me?

CHANDLER:
 cheese, its smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too.

 uh, not really. but when it comes to cheese, im one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.

MONICA:
 me too! yeah, chandler cant stand it. he wont even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.

 and youre still married to him?  

MONICA:
 you know what id love to do? i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheesenot even bread, just cheese. no, i want the bread. yeah. ah, and pastries  just i used to be fat.

 well if you where ever enter the loire valley let me know, ive got a great little villa you can stay at.

CHANDLER:
 is it made of cheese?

 no. but god, a house made of cheese, wouldnt that be incredible?!

MONICA:
 id move in tomorrow!

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 im so sorry.

CHANDLER:
 what do we do?

PHOEBE:
 i dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! i dont know how you fight that. 

JOEY:
 okay. okay, i can do this. i can tell her how i feel. just uh, just stand up straight.  

RACHEL:
 joey? whats up?

JOEY:
 i uh, i just came by because i-i want to talk to you about something.

RACHEL:
 okay whats up?

JOEY:
 here? in the hall? what are we animals?

RACHEL:
 well honey, im late for a meeting. so can you just make it quick?

JOEY:
 okay umm, i just came by to tell you that iwant to have dinner with you tonight. thats all.

RACHEL:
 sure! that sounds great! just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. okay? 

JOEY:
 okay. thats good. okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what youre gonna say. good. yeah.   dont you people ever knock?! 

MONICA:
 id like to have don and phoebe over. wouldnt that be nice?

CHANDLER:
 sure, why dont you set it up. ill just be over here, browsing through the personals.

MONICA:
 are you okay? youve been acting weird all afternoon.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, fine. fine. not perfect!! but good enough.

MONICA:
 jeez! what is with you?

CHANDLER:
 im sorry, did you say cheese?

MONICA:
 all right, whats going on?

CHANDLER:
 phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates, and i dont believe in that kind of stuff. but then you two totally get along. so look, i wont stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese.

MONICA:
 chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?

CHANDLER:
 no. but im sure 

MONICA:
 i dont believe in soul mates either.

CHANDLER:
 you dont?

MONICA:
 no. i dont think that you and i were destined to end up together. i think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. some days we work really hard.

CHANDLER:
 so youyou dont want to live with don in a cheese house?

MONICA:
 no, ive had second thoughts about that. do you realize how hard that would be to clean?

CHANDLER:
 i love you.

MONICA:
 i know.

CHANDLER:
 yknow what? i am going to take you out to dinner tonight. i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .   no? really? they taste so good. 

RACHEL:
 and i know chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. i mean im really worried the babys not going to like him. 

JOEY:
 what? yeah! sure! uh, look at the uh, the reason is it hot in here?

RACHEL:
 no. not-not for me, but why dont you take off your sweater?

JOEY:
 i would, but this is a nice place and my t-shirt has a picture of calvin doing hobbs.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! really?! can i see it?

JOEY:
 yeah. sure.  

RACHEL:
 huh. wow, i wouldnt think hobbs would like that so much.

JOEY:
 uh how long have we known each other?

RACHEL:
 um, sevene-e-eight, eight years. wow.

JOEY:
 uh-huh, long time.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 but over the past few weeks 

 hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! we have a couple specials tonight

JOEY:
 actually uh, could you give us a second?

 sure. sure.   notthat kind of table. 

RACHEL:
 so you were saying?

JOEY:
 im not quite sure.

RACHEL:
 okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and i said, "eight years." and the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and ummnow here we are.

JOEY:
 yeah, here we are. uhh i i think imfalling in love with you.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 im falling in love with you.

RACHEL:
  its a joke!   oh.  umm i-iuh, wow. are you uh how did umm when?

JOEY:
 does it really matter?

RACHEL:
 wow! wow. wow. wow, it is hot in here.

JOEY:
 okay look rach, i know this is a lot. you dont have to say anything. you-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  you gotta say something!

RACHEL:
 joey, joey i love you so much, but i

JOEY:
 but. 

RACHEL:
 joey.

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah right. thats okay. thats fine. thats uh, pretty much what i was expecting. so uh, its no big deal. all right? i think im gonna go. 

RACHEL:
 no! joey please! please dont! please dont leave like this! now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! 

JOEY:
 dont start doing that. you cant do that rach, cause then youre gonna make me do that.  

RACHEL:
 can i? 

JOEY:
 sure!  

RACHEL:
 oh joey honey i donti dont want to lose

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey, hey! you cant. okay? ever!

RACHEL:
 im so sorry.

JOEY:
 oh no-no rach, please, dont be sorry. okay? dont be sorry. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, that was a real good one. closing credits  

 is this your table?

 yeah.

 god, youre gonna be here all night!

 i know! i havent even read them the specials yet!

 whats the matter with them?

RACHEL:
 joey? are you in there?  

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 joey, you have to talk to her!

JOEY:
 no-no, i cant! i cant! not after the other night, its just itstoo weird, okay? dont tell her im here!   dont eat that!  

RACHEL:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey rachel!

RACHEL:
 is joey here?

CHANDLER:
 i dont see him. 

MONICA:
 i dont see him. hey! maybe hes in the sugar bowl!   joey? nope! 

RACHEL:
 well, at least you make each other laugh.

MONICA:
 whats up?

RACHEL:
 well, i havent seen him since that night that he told me how he yknow i dont know, i think hes avoiding me. why is that bagel on the floor?

MONICA:
 we were playing a game.

RACHEL:
 ew, was chandler naked? sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?

MONICA:
 sure.

CHANDLER:
 what?! no! no!

RACHEL:
 all right. well listen, if you see joey will you just tell him uhtell him i miss him. 

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 yeah, a naked bagel game?  dude, i dont know. thats a pretty small hole.

MONICA:
 honey, you gotta talk to her.

JOEY:
 i cant! yknow? you guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.

CHANDLER:
  25 i thought the only response to, "i love you," was, "oh crap!"

MONICA:
 hello? no rejection? i got shot down at fat camp! boy, kids are mean when theyre hungry.

JOEY:
 all right so, so what do i do?

MONICA:
 this is rachel. i mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? i mean i know its weird, its awkward, but you gotta at least try.

JOEY:
 yeah. okay.  whoa! 

CHANDLER:
  opening credits  

PHOEBE:
 okay, so when youre done with your tea ill look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.

CHANDLER:
 i didnt know you read tea leaves.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah, ive done it for years. i actually stopped because i was so accurate. yknow, and-and yknow, one of the great joys of life is its-its wondrous unpredictability. yknow? and also tea tends to give me the trots.

MONICA:
 okay, im done. read mine.

PHOEBE:
 okay.  which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 uh-hmm. uh-hmm, whos next?

RACHEL:
 okay, im done. do mine.

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

RACHEL:
 ah.

PHOEBE:
 oh!  or youre gonna make a scientific discovery!

RACHEL:
 well, i have been spending a lot of time in the lab.

CHANDLER:
 what does yours say pheebs?

PHOEBE:
 umm wow, all right.  gonna meet a guy! and really soon! and hes gonna be the man of my dreams. probably not the guy i had a dream about last night. 

ROSS:
  like a faded salmon?

MONICA:
 you mean your pink shirt?

ROSS:
 faded salmon color.

MONICA:
 no, i-i havent seen your pink shirt.

ROSS:
 great! great. then i mustve left it at monas. i knew it!

CHANDLER:
 well, im sure you get another one at ann taylors.

ROSS:
 thats my favorite shirt! okay? i love that shirt!

RACHEL:
 well just ask mona to give it back!

ROSS:
 i dont know. i mean i-i guess i could. its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. and if i go over there id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.  

PHOEBE:
  second you guysfor the last couple weeks ive been that guy everywhere i go. we take the same bus. we go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the tea guy. 

CHANDLER:
 phoebe, did you see that?! he totally checked you out! he is so cute!  mean? 

RACHEL:
 hi!

JOEY:
 hey.  

RACHEL:
 hi.

JOEY:
 hi. 

MONICA:
 tea gives phoebe the trots. 

RACHEL:
 so i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.

CHANDLER:
 i know its tough now, but things will get better.

RACHEL:
 how do you know that? what if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?!

CHANDLER:
 im not great at the advice, can i interest you in a sarcastic comment? some cheese?

MONICA:
 honey, what is the bruce springsteen cd in the kat stevens case?

CHANDLER:
 lets just say if i cant find the right cd case i just put it in the nearest one.

MONICA:
 okay, where is the kat stevens cd?

CHANDLER:
 in the james taylor case.

MONICA:
 where is the james taylor cd?

CHANDLER:
 honey, im gonna save you some time, 200 cds, not one of them in the right case.

MONICA:
 okay. no need to panic. deep breathes everyone. okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the cds in the right cases.

CHANDLER:
 well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. yknow alphabetically or by genre?

MONICA:
 hmm, i dont know. we really have to talk this through.

RACHEL:
 oh my god!! you guys have such problems!! i feel so terrible for you!

MONICA:
 okay, i-im sorry. you and joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah. that makes sense.

MONICA:
 yeah, like i dont know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.

RACHEL:
 ooh, i can do that.

MONICA:
 good. 

CHANDLER:
 they were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 hi.

MONICA:
 uh i really dont know what to tell you rach, i really dont. i mean, maybe joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 yeah joey shesrachels got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. wow!  gonna make dinner were gonna have to leave. yeah. 

JOEY:
 so you uh, have abig work problem?

RACHEL:
 yeah its umm yeah its uh it-its yknowits nothing.

JOEY:
 huh. okay. 

RACHEL:
 yeahno wait! joey no wait it is. its something. its-its ummits my boss.

JOEY:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 yeah, and umm my baby.

JOEY:
 yeah?

RACHEL:
 my boss wants to buy my baby!

JOEY:
 what?! oh my-oh my god!

RACHEL:
 i know i told you, its a really big problem.

JOEY:
 what he wants to buy your baby?!

RACHEL:
 can you believe that?!

JOEY:
 thats crazy!

RACHEL:
 thats what i told him!

JOEY:
 okay, how did this even happen?

RACHEL:
 well ill tell ya!  wifethey-they cant have children. so umm, and thatwe were at the christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "rachel, i want to buy your baby."

JOEY:
 man! when you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby i figured it was something about maternity leave.

RACHEL:
 ohh! yeah!  problem.  

PHOEBE:
 oh hello.

 oh, its you. i see you everywhere. im jim, jim nelson.

PHOEBE:
 oh jim, jim nelson im phoebe, phoebe buffay. we certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately. 

 we have. maybe well be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 oclock?

PHOEBE:
 well, maybe we will.   

ROSS:
 mona?  her extra key is. he reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. he looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. after dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the  okay, if i were a salmon shirt, where would i be? 

  shirt.

 oh, its okay.

 no, its still wet. yknow what? let me get it out before it sets. ooh, i have something you can wear. here. 

 oh umm, i-i dont know if i want to wear a womans shirt.

 no-no thats a mans shirt.

 its awfully pink.   

CHANDLER:
 oh my god, honey we are so meant to be together. we both have copies of the annie soundtrack.

MONICA:
 honey, both yours.

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 yeah? the work problem?

RACHEL:
 oh it was perfect! i mean it really felt like he was my friend again.

CHANDLER:
 what problem did you tell him you had?

RACHEL:
 oh thats not important. the point is, i reallyi think everythings gonna be okay. 

 may i help you?

JOEY:
 do you think you can just buy my friends baby?! commercial break 

PHOEBE:
 isnt it funny how we kept running into each other? its as if someone really wants us to be together.

 someone does. me.

PHOEBE:
 oh, witty banter. well done.

 so, tell me a little bit about yourself.

PHOEBE:
 oh okay, well im a masseuse, and i used to work at this place

 do you like to party?

PHOEBE:
 i-i-i like, i like parties.

 youre wild, arent ya?

PHOEBE:
 yeah i guess, a little.

 it aint no thing, im wild too.

PHOEBE:
  wildly i guess, for ummwell since i was fourteen.

 im sorry. im staring. its just that you have the most beautiful eyes.

PHOEBE:
 oh stop it.

 and your breasts! hmm!!!

PHOEBE:
 okay. umm look, youre coming on a little strong. but im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. so, why dont we just start over okay? and you can just tell me about yourself.

 all right.

PHOEBE:
 okay.

 i write erotic novels, for children.

PHOEBE:
 what?!

 theyre wildly unpopular.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!

 oh also, you might be interested to know that i have a ph.d.

PHOEBE:
 wow! you do?

 yeah, 

PHOEBE:
 all right.  

CHANDLER:
  bottom dollar that tomorrow  be sun.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 hey! oh joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. that really meant a lot.

JOEY:
 not a problem. oh, and just so you know, that guys not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 lets just say i took care of it.

RACHEL:
 whoa-whoa-whoa, lets say more!

JOEY:
 dont worry! dont worry. i just told him, very nicely, "you dont go buying peoples babies, so back off!!"

RACHEL:
 what?! 

 what?!

RACHEL:
 no! no, no-no-no joey he doesnt want to buy my baby! i made that up!

JOEY:
 what?! why?!

RACHEL:
 so that we would have something to talk about! so it wouldnt be awkward!

JOEY:
 and you couldnt think of anything else?!

MONICA:
 you said your boss wants to buy your baby?!

RACHEL:
  im-im gonna lose my job! what am i going to do?!

CHANDLER:
 you can always sell your baby.

RACHEL:
 oh joey, i cant believe you brought my boss into this! im gonna get fired!

JOEY:
 you lied to me!

RACHEL:
 well, she told me too! 

MONICA:
 chandler has two copies of annie!  magazine while lying behind the couch and sees something that he likes. meanwhile, monas date takes off rosss shirt and mona throws it on the floor. while they start making out again, ross tries to pull the rug the shirt is on over to him, but while 

 

ROSS:
 hello!!

 ross, what are you doing?!

ROSS:
 not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable. 

RACHEL:
 morning. you wanted to see me?

 please, come in. have a seat. 

RACHEL:
 okay look mr. zelner

 oh i think its best that i speak first.

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

 ive asked lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.

RACHEL:
 oh god.

 if i in any way implied that i wanted to buy your babyi am sorry. okay? last week when i asked you when your due date was uh, i certainly did not mean that i felt that i was due your baby. yeah, i want to be very clear that i understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.

RACHEL:
 well, as long as we are clear about that.  

PHOEBE:
 oh there it is.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
  and dad this year?

ROSS:
 uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?

MONICA:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 yes! every year ross makes the toast, and its always really moving, and always makes them cry. well this year im going to make them cry.

CHANDLER:
 and you wonder why ross is their favorite?

MONICA:
 no! really! any time ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "god, your brother." know what theyll say this year? "god, you"

JOEY:
 well i can promise you, at least one person will be crying.   im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. 

MONICA:
 really you can do that?

JOEY:
 are you kidding me? watch!  cant do it with you guys watching me! opening credits

RACHEL:

 and also, congratulations on your wedding.

ROSS:
 whawhat?

 what?!

 thanks for going along with this.

ROSS:
 dad so what we have to pretend that were married?

 son, i had to shave my ears for tonight. you can do this.

ROSS:
 can you believe that?

RACHEL:
 yeah, if youre going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.

ROSS:
 no, us having to lie about being married.

RACHEL:
 no, i know i dont either, but ya know what, its their party, and its just one night. and we dont even have to lie; we just wont say anything. if it comes up again, well justsmile. well nod along.

 ross!

 rachel!

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:

ROSS:
 hey

PHOEBE:
 hey!

 what a beautiful place. what a great night! i have to tell you, being here with all of you in event room ci feel so lucky. i think of all the good times that have happened here. the birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! my god, i dont want to forget this moment! its like i want to take a mental picture of you all! click!  

CHANDLER:
 i dont think the flash went off.

 dahaaa!  im going to find the mens room, be right back.

PHOEBE:
 ill go with you

 come on!

CHANDLER:
 somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.

JOEY:
 i have to go to the bathroom too, but i dont want him complimenting my thing.

ROSS:
 im so we werent in the car! did he ever let up?

MONICA:
 he called the long island expressway a concrete miracle.

ROSS:
  take a mental picture!  

PHOEBE:
 were you guys making fun of parker?

ROSS:
 that depends, how much did you hear?

PHOEBE:
 so, he a little enthusiastic, whats wrong with that?

MONICA:
 its just that, its so much.

PHOEBE:
 well, so what i like him! do i make fun of the people youve dated? tag, janice, mona? no, because friends dont do that. but, do you want my opinion? do you want it? cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the whos who of human crap. 

MONICA:
 i feel terrible.

JOEY:
 i know

ROSS:
 what was wrong with mona? commercial break  

RACHEL:
 open it! open it! open it!

ROSS:
 yeah baby!

 so we never got to hear about your wedding!

 we were surprise that we werent invited.

ROSS:
 no, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. it was a small wedding.

RACHEL:
 but it was beautiful. i mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.

 where did you have it?

RACHEL:
 on a cliff, in barbados, at sunset, and stevie wonder sang isnt she lovely as i walked down the aisle.

 really? 

RACHEL:
 yeah, stevies an old family friend. 

 oh my god. that sounds amazing. i would love to see pictures.

RACHEL:
 so would i. you wouldnt think that annie liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.

ROSS:
 would you excuse us for a second?  umm. what are you doing?

RACHEL:
 what? im not you. this may be the only wedding i ever have. i want it to be amazing.

ROSS:
 okay, okay. ooooh, ooh maybe i rode in on a harley. 

RACHEL:
 okay, ross, it has to be realistic. 

 are you okay? you seem kind of quiet.

PHOEBE:
 no, im fine. im great. im with you.

 and im with you! what a great time to be alive! look at this plate-bouncy thing.  dispensing problems. 

PHOEBE:
 hm huh, yeah.

 ah! oysters! let me feed you one.

PHOEBE:
 no, thats not necessary.

 please.

PHOEBE:
 no, actually i dont eat

 i wont quit until you try.

PHOEBE:
 okay, fine! fine!   mmmhmmmmm.

 what are they like? ive never had one.

PHOEBE:
 why dont you just try one?

 no, they look too weird. 

CHANDLER:
 what are you doin?

MONICA:
 just going over my toast. those two will never know what hit em. i cant wait. theyre going to be crying so hard. theyre going to be fighting for breath. 

CHANDLER:
 ya know if you want to, i can just hold them down and you could  

RACHEL:
 and my veil was lace, made by blind, belgium nuns.

 blind?

RACHEL:
 well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.

 ill bet you looked beautiful

RACHEL:
 well, i dont know about that, but some said that i looked like a floating angel.

 

RACHEL:
 oh yeah. thats a great story.

ROSS:
 well, um, actually, i-i took her to the planetarium. thats-thats where we had our first date. um, she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower

 oh that is so sweet!

RACHEL:
 shhh! i want to hear the rest!

ROSS:
 then, fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "will you marry me?" 

RACHEL:
 and the ring, was the size of my fist  

JOEY:
 yeah uh, phoebe! look umm, i want to apologize about before, okay? we were being jerks. parkers a nice guy and id like to get to know him.

PHOEBE:
 then you better do it now.

JOEY:
 why?

PHOEBE:
 because im going to kill him

JOEY:
 what-what? 

PHOEBE:
 you guys were right. hes just too excited abouteverything. i mean im all for living life, but this is the gellers 35th anniversary. okay? lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.

JOEY:
 i know im having the worst time. there was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when i finally got up to the plates, i slipped on a giant booger!

PHOEBE:
 are you sure it wasnt an oyster?

JOEY:
 i guess it couldve been, i didnt really look at it. yknow, i just wiped it on chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.

PHOEBE:
 hes just such a great guy im so excited about him.

JOEY:
 oh hey, you should be excited about him. theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy. 

PHOEBE:
 you think?

JOEY:
 yeah. ya know what i think; i think we were all just being too negative.

PHOEBE:
 youre right. youre right, hes just embracing life. we could all stand to be a little more like parker. you know what? i am like him! im a sunny, positive person. 

JOEY:
 actually, you have a little bit of an edge.

PHOEBE:
 whats that now?

JOEY:
 nothing

PHOEBE:
 oh look its parker! 

 look! its the bunny hop!

PHOEBE:
 oooh i love it!

 you do?!

PHOEBE:
 are you kidding? people acting like animals to music. come on! 

MONICA:
 okay its time for the toast! umm now-now, i know that ross usually gives the toast, but this year im going to do it. 

MONICA:
 no, no its going to be great. really! mom, dad, when i got married, one of the things that made me sure i could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. for that and so many other things i want to say thank you. i know i probably dont say it enough, but i love you.   when i look around this room, im-im saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she cant because shes dead. as is our dog chi-chi. i mean look how cute she is.   do me a favor and pass this to my parents. remember shes dead. okay, her and nana, gone. wow! hey does anybody remember when debra winger had to say goodbye to her children in terms of endearment?  no movie fans?! you want to hear something sad? the other day i was watching 60 minutes these orphans in romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love.   you people are made of stone! heres to mom and dad! whatever!

 thank you monica that was uh, interesting. wasnt it interesting, jack?

 

 ross, why dont you give us your toast now?

ROSS:
 oh, no, mom, its just monica this year.

 youre not going to say anything? on our 35th wedding anniversary

ROSS:
 no, of course, um um, everybody? um, i-i just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, rachel  ifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.

 

 i just wish nana were alive to hear rosss toast. 

 my god what a fantastically well lit hallway!

PHOEBE:
 can i get you something to drink? like a water and valium? 

 i must say this apartment, its, its, there are no words

PHOEBE:
 oh thank god. 

 its a haven. a third-floor paradise. a modern-day eden in the midst

PHOEBE:
 yeah? i know! i know! uh huh? listen why dont we just um, sit and relax? you know just be with each other. quietly! 

 that sounds great.  ive ever sat on in my entire life. 

PHOEBE:
 lets try something else, lets play a game.

 i love games!

PHOEBE:
 shocking! lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. 

 orjenga.

PHOEBE:
 but, lets play this one first. and remember whoever talks first loses!  

 i lose, now jenga.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! oh my god! 

 is something wrong?

PHOEBE:
 wrong? really? you know the word wrong. everything isnt perfect? everything isnt magical? everything isnt a glow with the light of a million fairies? they were just brake lights, parker! 

 well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!

PHOEBE:
 you dont have to put a good spin on everything.

 im sorry thats who i am. im a positive person.

PHOEBE:
 no! i am a positive person. you are like santa clause on prozac, at disneyland, getting laid! 

 so what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?

PHOEBE:
 much less happy!

 fine! well then to quote ross, "id better be going." 

PHOEBE:
 so long! dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!  

 isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your entire life? 

PHOEBE:
 uh huh.  

ROSS:
 and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!

RACHEL:
 ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.

ROSS:
 but having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?

RACHEL:
 it was really fun being married to you tonight. 

ROSS:
 yeah! and! and, it was the easiest 400 bucks ive ever made.

RACHEL:
 okay ross, can i uh, can i ask you something?

ROSS:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 that proposal, at the planetarium

ROSS:
 i know, i know it was stupid. 

RACHEL:
 are you kidding?! with the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! it wasreally wonderful! did you just make that up? 

ROSS:
 no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out. its how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me. 

RACHEL:
 well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. 

ROSS:
 its a good thing i didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding. 

RACHEL:
 goodnight 

ROSS:
 even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up? 

RACHEL:
 i will think about it. 

ROSS:
 thats all im askin  ending credits 

MONICA:
 okay thats it. i give up. at mom and dads 40th anniversary, youre the one giving the speech. 

ROSS:
 yknow i dont understand why they didnt cry. it was a beautiful speech. 

MONICA:
 oh, come on. 

ROSS:
 hey! all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad! and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin. and what you said about nana. ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. and you know what? i think she was. 

RACHEL:
 hi!

ROSS:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 so, im in my apartment doing the soap opera digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.  

JOEY:
  thats me!! im blank!!

MONICA:
 how cool is this?! we know three down! im touching three down! 

JOEY:
 yeah you are baby.

MONICA:
 three down knows im married, whats three down doin?

RACHEL:
 so did they call you to tell you your names gonna be in this?

JOEY:
 no. they really like me over there. they want to do a big profile on me, but i said no.

ROSS:
 whyd you say no?

JOEY:
 remember what happened the last time i did an interview for them? i said i write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. so who knows what i might say this time.

CHANDLER:
 if only there was something in your head to control the things you say. 

RACHEL:
 oh, come on joey! you will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! and you deserve that! and if you do the interview you can mention, oh i dont know, gal pal rachel green?

CHANDLER:
 is that gal pal spelled l-o-s-e-r?

RACHEL:
 okay, dont listen to him. please?

JOEY:
 fine! all right, ill do it. but hey! you guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if i yknow, start to say something stupid.

ROSS:
 just then or-or all the time, cause we-we have jobs yknow.

RACHEL:
 come on! we will be there for you the whole time! just remember gal pal rachel green.  in the dumb crossword puzzle. 

JOEY:
 yeah. opening credits  

 i really appreciate you taking the time to do this.

JOEY:
 oh, not at all. happy to do it.  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 no, were just four people with neck problems. you talk like this.  

  here. yknow when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.

JOEY:
  wouldnt have mattered, im doing this for the fans, not for the free food.

 can i get you anything?

 umm, ill have a cup of coffee.

JOEY:
 and ill have all the muffins. 

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 shhh! were not talking.

PHOEBE:
 oh. finally! oh.  

 so, according to your bio, youve done quite a bit of work before days of our lives. anything youre particularly proud of?   

JOEY:
    all you want is a dingle,   what you envy's a schwang,   a thing through which you can tinkle,   or play with, or simply let hang...     

 folks, has this ever happened to you. you go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open. 

JOEY:
 oh, you said it mike.   aw! there's got to be a better way! 

 and there is kevin.  

 this is the first time hes ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you  this works with any milk carton. 

JOEY:
   now, i can have milk everyday.    

 so this is it? victor? 

JOEY:
 yeah, i guess it is. and so im gonna get on this spaceship,   and im gonna go to blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. but when i return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. but i wont have aged at all.  great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because adrienne babyim gonna want to meet her.      

JOEY:
 shh, ok, here i come, here i come. see i'm comin' to fix the copier, i can't get to the copier, i'm thinkin' what do i do, what do i doso i just watch 'em have sex. and then i say, wait, here's my line,  the paper tray. 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 thank you. wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. there i am, there i am, there i am, there i am, there i am 

JOEY:
 well, there are so many things, its hard to pick just one. 

PHOEBE:
 im gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, id actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.

ROSS:
 uh, double latte, extra foam.

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!   lamenting the fact that every beautiful woman they see doesnt want to have sex right  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

JOEY:

ROSS:

ROSS:

JOEY:
 oh, i-i, i think that's the first time i ever missed a meal!   yeah, my pants are a little loose!    

CHANDLER:
 whats wrong with you? 

JOEY:
 nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. but um, i dont think its anything serious. 

CHANDLER:
 this sounds like a hernia. you have toyou-yougo to the doctor! 

JOEY:
 no way! kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!   why did i have to start working out again?  damn you 15s!   

RACHEL:
 its a trifle. its got all of these layers. first theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch.  beef sautéed with peas and onions,  a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!  

ROSS:
 it tastes like feet! 

JOEY:
 i like it. 

ROSS:
 are you kidding? 

JOEY:
 whats not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? goooooood.    

JOEY:
 the fridge broke. i have to eat everything. cold cuts, ice cream, limeshey, what was in that brown jar? 

CHANDLER:
 thats still in there?! 

JOEY:
 not anymore.     

RACHEL:
 oh! yay! look! theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it! 

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 hey, come on now!   

JOEY:
   

JOEY:

JOEY:
 ill take those to go. 

 oh, i know what i wanted to ask you. you were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. what happened there?

JOEY:
 it was so stupid, i said some stuff in an interview that i shouldnt have said. but believe me, thats not gonna happen today.

JOEY:
 well, i said that i  commercial break

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
 well this one's for you. 

JOEY:
 get out. 

CHANDLER:
 no, i can't. no-no, listen, i, i know how much this means to you and i also know that this is about more than just jewelry,  you and me and the fact that we're  

JOEY:
 wow, is this friendship? i think so. check it out, we're bracelet buddies. 

CHANDLER:
 that's what they'll call us.    

RACHEL:
 oh, joey! sorry!

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 rach! hey! its fine! youre at joeys!

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 yeah! look! 

RACHEL:
 ive never lived like this before.

JOEY:
 i know. 

JOEY:
 all right, dont waste it, i mean its still food.     

ROSS:
 all right i've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because i wanna be a good friend, and damnit i am a good friend. so just, just shut up and close your eyes 

JOEY:
 wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and i didn't get it. but that was a hell of a kiss. rachel is a very lucky girl.   

JOEY:
 all right. let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.   and they're off!   

PHOEBE:
 get your foot off my contestant! judge! 

JOEY:
 judge rules, no violation. 

PHOEBE:
 ohhh. 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
  just an old wonton! 

JOEY:

PHOEBE:
 ohh, tough call. 

JOEY:

JOEY:
 id seen this thing on the discovery channel... 

ROSS:
 wait a minute! i saw that! on the discovery channel, yeah! about jellyfish and how if you...  peed on yourself?! 

 ewwww!! 

MONICA:
 you cant say that!! you-you dont know!! i mean i thought i was gonna pass out from the pain! anyway i-i tried, but i-i couldnt...bend that way. so...  

  

JOEY:
 thats right i stepped up! shes my friend and she needed help! and if i had too, id pee on anyone of you! 

JOEY:
 umm, no. no best friend, no. just a lot of close friends.

 so umm, now back to the show. how does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?

JOEY:
 really? me? wow! i dont even know any huge gay people! 

CHANDLER:
 it hurts me. it physically hurts me. 

 now, off the record, youre not  

JOEY:
 what? are you referring to my man's bag? at first, i thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. check it out! it's got compartments for all your stuff! your wallet! your keys! your address book!

ROSS:
 your make-up!  

ROSS:
 okay. now-now-now should i climb down your front so were face to face or-or should i climb down your back so were-were butt to face.

JOEY:
 i think face to face.

ROSS:
 i would say that.

JOEY:
 face to face, yeah!

ROSS:
 okay, here i go.

JOEY:
 all right.  

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 i prefer not to answer that right now, im still carrying a little holiday weight.  torso, but that doesnt work very well and hes forced to wrap his legs around 

JOEY:
 yknow, when we talked about face to face, i dont think we thought it all the way through.   

JOEY:
 hey pheebs!  

PHOEBE:
 hey! 

JOEY:
 check it out.   how much of a man am i?! 

PHOEBE:
 wow! nice! manly and also kind of a slut.   

CHANDLER:
 youre turning into a woman. 

JOEY:
 no im not. why would you say that? thats just mean. 

CHANDLER:
 now ive upset you? what did i say? 

JOEY:
 its not what you said. its the way you said it oh my god, im a woman!!!   

JOEY:
 great nap.

ROSS:
 it really was.  at them. needless to say joey and ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the  

JOEY:
 uh me? gay? no! no. no, but i have a number of close friends who are. 

 so, lets talk about women. im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.  

JOEY:
 oh-oh-oh-oh, how i do it is, i look a woman up and down and say, "hey, how you doin?"

PHOEBE:
 oh, please!

JOEY:
     stuff. this guy playing street football catches a pass next to the car cover joey is 

JOEY:
 hey! how you doin?

 

JOEY:
 id love to show ya, but i just tucked her in. shes sleeping.  same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses

 no! i mean you're a really nice guy and i'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, i'm just y'know, i just don't feel that way about you.

JOEY:
 oh! i see what happened. it's because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you'd feel a lot different if i turned it on.

 i don't think so.

JOEY:
 oh, i do. 

 i'm okay.

JOEY:
 what?!?! oh dear god! 

JOEY:
 not much to tell there im really shy. 

 so, thats it. i guess thats all i need. thank you so much. i think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.

JOEY:
 oh great! great! thank you. 

 bye.

JOEY:
 bye-bye.   i did it!

RACHEL:
 yeah!

ROSS:
 amazing! amazing!

  this. other than days of our lives, whats your favorite soap opera?

JOEY:
 oh, i dont watch soap operas. excuse me, i have a life, yknow? 

 thank you. the readers at soap opera digest will be happy to hear that.

JOEY:
 oh, good to know.  closing credits 

RACHEL:
 wow! i cant believe they didnt put it in the part where you said you didnt watch soap operas.

JOEY:
 yeah, i called the lady about that. i told her i was just joking. she was pretty nice about that.

MONICA:
 you slept with her didnt you?

JOEY:
 little bit, yeah.

ROSS:
 wow! this picture of you sure is steamy.

JOEY:
 oh yeah, thats just a little something for my huge gay fan base. 

ROSS:
 did you just wink at me?

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 so whats the final head count on my baby shower?

PHOEBE:
 about twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do. 

MONICA:
 also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.

RACHEL:
 what?! you mean theyre not coming to a social event where theres no men and theres no booze?! thats shocking! i dont care, as long as my moms here.

MONICA:
 oh my god, your mother!

RACHEL:
 what?! my moms not gonna be here?!

MONICA:
 well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.

RACHEL:
 my god!

MONICA:
 well it wasnt my fault, phoebe was in charge of the invitations!

PHOEBE:
 well i dont, i dont have a mother so often i forget that other people

MONICA:
 

RACHEL:
 so my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!

PHOEBE:
 no. 

MONICA:
 okay, yknow what? dont worry, okay? well take care of it. well call her. just go home and get ready.

RACHEL:
 please, make sure she comes. its really important to me, i mean its my mom!

PHOEBE:
 i know. i know, whats her number?

RACHEL:
 i dont know.

MONICA:
 go! i have it in my book. go!    the one who has to call herhello mrs. green! hi, its monica geller.

 oh, hello monica.

MONICA:
  throw an impromptu baby shower for rachel today.

 i know, my daughters told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.

MONICA:
 yeah, im sorry. im-im so sorry.

 for what dear? for not inviting me or lying about it?

MONICA:
  can you come? its today at four.

 well all right. ill see you at four.

MONICA:
 thank you. 

PHOEBE:
 isnt it at three?

MONICA:
 son of a bitch!  opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 hey joe! you wanna shoot some hoops?

JOEY:
 oh no, i cant go. im practicing; i got an audition to be the host of a new game show.

ROSS:
 oh cool!

CHANDLER:
 thats great.

JOEY:
 yeah-yeah, and if i get it by day ill  remoray, but by night ill be 

CHANDLER:
 youll be perfect for this! thats already your name!

JOEY:
 but the auditions in a couple hours and i dont even understand the game.

ROSS:
 well do you want some help?

JOEY:
 oh really? thatd be great! you guys can be the contestants!

ROSS:
 awesome!

CHANDLER:
 okay, i guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 bamboozled?

JOEY:
 yeah, isnt that a cool name?

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 all right. uhh, okay. our first contestant is ross geller. why dont you tell us a little something about you ross?

ROSS:
 well uh, i-im a paleontologist. umm, i-i live in new york. i have a son ben. uh, hi ben! 

JOEY:
 i said a little bit ross. now, how about you chandler?

CHANDLER:
 well joey, im a headhunter. i hook up out of work soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. hi rasputin! 

JOEY:
 excellent! lets play bamboozled! chandler, youll go first. what is the capital of columbia?

CHANDLER:
 bogota.

JOEY:
 its ba-go-ta, but close enough. now, you can either pass your turn to ross or pick a wicked wango card.

CHANDLER:
 what does a wicked wango card do?

JOEY:
 i should know that. lets see, just one moment please. umm, here we are, a wicked wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.

CHANDLER:
 higher or lower than what?

JOEY:
 this is embarrassing. 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 im sorry, i dont believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, i told the stripper to be here at five. thats good right?

MONICA:
 you ordered a stripper for the shower?! that is totally inappropriate!

PHOEBE:
 what? hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  mrs. green!

MONICA:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 im so glad you could make it.

MONICA:
 yes, thank you so much. and again, were so sorry. we could not feel worse about it.

 try. theres my little girl. 

MONICA:
 shes still mad.

PHOEBE:
 yeah i know. isnt it great? one less person we have to make small talk with.

MONICA:
 phoebe, sandras mad at you too. it-it doesnt bother you?

PHOEBE:
 no look, weve apologized twice! i cant do anymore than that. i know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.

MONICA:
 okay. i can do that.  

 look at that face! just like when you were in high school! if i didnt know better id say you were a cheerleader in trouble. come on, lets get some tea.

RACHEL:
 okay. 

 oh my look at that. only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? now i dont want you to use your housekeeper cause it would just split her focus.

RACHEL:
 oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, i dont even have a housekeeper.

 its like youre a cave person. rachel, you must get a nanny. you dont know how overwhelming this is going to be. i mean when you were a baby i had full time help, i had mrs. kay.

RACHEL:
 mrs. kay! oh yeah, she was sweet. she taught me spanish. i actually think i remember some of it, tu madre es loca.  

 such a sweet woman.

RACHEL:
 well, however great she was i just cant afford that.

 oh rachel!

RACHEL:
 what?

 i just had the greatest idea! im gonna come live with you!

RACHEL:
 wh-wh-what? what?

 oh, im so happy im gonna do this for my little girl. aw, look at you. you have tears in your eyes.

RACHEL:
 yes. yes i do. 

JOEY:
 all right ross youre in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the wheel of mayhem?

ROSS:
 the wheel has not been my friend tonight joey. uh, ill take another question. 

JOEY:
 okay, this is gonna be tough. hold your breath.

ROSS:
 its okay, im ready.

JOEY:
 no dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question.

CHANDLER:
 this is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath  

JOEY:
 okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, trisholy cow, thats a big word. trisc seriously look at this thing. chandler, how do you say that?

CHANDLER:
 let me see that.

JOEY:
 this one right here. 

CHANDLER:
 triscadecaphobia.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 no! no, fear of the number 13.

CHANDLER:
 fear of triscuts?

ROSS:
 its possible, they have really sharp edges.

JOEY:
 all right chandler, youre up.

ROSS:
 wait a minute, i-i believe im entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn?

CHANDLER:
 this game makes no sense!

ROSS:
 yknow what? youre just upset because youre losing.

CHANDLER:
 oh come on ross, i think were all losers here.

JOEY:
 all right. chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card.

CHANDLER:
 let me think. let me thinkoh! i dont care.

JOEY:
 you-you must choose mr. bing.

CHANDLER:
 either, it makes no difference.

JOEY:
 choose, you jackass!

CHANDLER:
 ill take a card.

JOEY:
 okay, you picked the gimmie card! you get all of rosss points!

ROSS:
 what?!

CHANDLER:
 this game is kinda fun.

ROSS:
  all my points just cause you

CHANDLER:
 i dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.  

RACHEL:
 why did you invite my mother?!

MONICA:
 what?

RACHEL:
 she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby.

PHOEBE:
 for how long?

RACHEL:
 eight weeks. i mean i love my mother, but my god, a long lunch with her is taxing.

MONICA:
 i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.

PHOEBE:
 she cant hear you.

RACHEL:
 what? you guys, come on! what am i going to do?

PHOEBE:
 well, if you dont want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.

RACHEL:
 youre right. youre right. i mean im about to have a baby, i can tell my mother that i dont want her to just be sleeping on my couch! oh my god! shes gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. this cannot happen!

MONICA:
 thats right. that is right, you go over there and tell her you dont want her to live with you. do not take no for an answer!

RACHEL:
 okay. 

MONICA:
  yknow what? and im just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.

PHOEBE:
 i have new respect for chandler. all right everybody! its time to open the presents!

MONICA:
 yes! yes! and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because youre the most important person in this room. and in the world!

 well uh, i dont have a gift because i wasnt invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyones attention.

PHOEBE:
 how about you less important people, lets open your presents! 

RACHEL:
 mom thats okay that you didnt get you a gift!

 well, i kinda did. me. eight weeks of me.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah. okay, see mom, the truth is i can do this on my own.

 sweetheart i know youre gonna be terrific mom, i just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.

RACHEL:
 but mom, i really know what im doing. i can handle this.

 really? remember twinkles?

RACHEL:
 he was a hamster! i am not going to vacuum up my baby!

PHOEBE:
 okay, come on rach its present time! yknow youre the glue thats holding this whole party together. its kinda falling apart here.

 oh look.

RACHEL:
 wow!

PHOEBE:
 okay, this is from your friend at work.

RACHEL:
 oh my gosh! oh wow! oh, i know what this is!  with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and  wait a minute. that cant be right. is that a beer bong for a baby?

 darling, thats a breast pump!

RACHEL:
 did i say i was done guessing? okay, thank you for that. oh wow! whats this?

 its a diaper genie.

RACHEL:
 oh, it dispenses clean diapers!

 no! its where you put the dirty ones!

RACHEL:
 well thats gross, why dont you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?

 oh youre gonna do that ten times a day?

RACHEL:
 what?! it goes ten times a day! what are we feeding this baby?! indian food?!

 no dear, thats what babies do.

MONICA:
 rachel, listen to your mother. she is very smart.

 plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while youre trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?

RACHEL:
 i dont know, id leave it on the changing table?   what?! whatd i do? whatd i do?!

 you cant leave a baby alone!

RACHEL:
 oh come never leave a baby alone! i mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. oh god, okay. yknow what? i think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. so i think umm, im just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. and for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.

 its actually a bassinet. 

RACHEL:
 okay mommy, dont ever leave me.  commercial break

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:
 yeah!!

CHANDLER:
 this is the best game ever!!!  

RACHEL:
 so umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as i need you?

 of course i am!

RACHEL:
 oh mom, i swear im not an idiot. ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but i-i just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. and-and then guess what? the babys coming and i dont know what to do. oh, can i throw up in my diaper genie?

 no. sweetie, youre gonna be fine. 

RACHEL:
 wait-wait where are you going? where are you going?

 im going to the bathroom.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 now dont worry! everythings gonna be okay.  while she is standing and rachel is sitting, seeing this monica decides to join in on the 

MONICA:
 it is going to be okay!   it was worth a shot.

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey! why are you all red and sweaty?

ROSS:
 i just bamboozled chandler!   which is not uh sexual thing. that was a quick shower.

PHOEBE:
 not if you were here.

ROSS:
 wow! it looks like we got a lot of good stuff.

RACHEL:
 oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 no. shes going to live with us for eight weeks.

ROSS:
 uh, what?

RACHEL:
 yes! shes gonna help us take care of the baby! woo-hoo.  

ROSS:
 whatyoure not serious. i mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. shell drive us totally crazy.

 

ROSS:
 hi roomie!  

 hey joey, hi! im ray; im the producer of the show.

JOEY:
 

 and this is duncan  help us out with the audition. so uh, lets get the camera rolling.

JOEY:
 

 whenever youre ready.

JOEY:
  bamboozled! erin, you get the first question! in hockey, who is known as the great one?

 wayne gretzky.

JOEY:
 correct! now, would you like to pick a wicked wango card or spin the wheel of mayhem?

 uh joey, didnt your agents give you the revised rules? weve eliminated all of that. no wheel, no cards.

JOEY:
 whatwhy?!

 uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didnt follow it.

JOEY:
 well whats complicated? you spin the wheel of mayhem to go up the ladder of chance. you go past the mud hut through the rainbow ring to get to the golden monkey; you yank his tail and boom! youre in paradise pond!

 yeah all thats gone. its basically just a simple question and answer game now.

JOEY:
 well whats fun about that? you expect me to be the host of a boring game thats just people standing around answering questions?

 well, therell be women in bikinis holding up the scores.

JOEY:
   

 and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have ross, i thought they might be more at home in the garage.

ROSS:
 well wewe dont have a garage.

 did i say garage? i meant garbage.

ROSS:
 yknow what? maybe, mrs. green, its not absolutely vital that you live with us.

 well rachel needs help with the baby.

RACHEL:
 i do. i really do. i dont know anything.

ROSS:
 im-im sure thats not true.

RACHEL:
 oh no? pheebs? monica? do i know anything about babies?

PHOEBE:
 no, not a thing.

MONICA:
 its frightening.

ROSS:
 well uh, yknow what? even if she doesnt know anything, i do! i have a son. and his mother and i didnt live together, and whenever he was with me i took care of him all the time, by myself.

 thats true. you do have another child.

ROSS:
 yeah.

 with another woman. have you no control ross?

ROSS:
 thats a different issue. uh, the point is, when the baby comes i will be there toto feed her and bathe her and change her. and more than that i want to do all those things.

 well then you really dont need me to live with you.

ROSS:
 yes! yes, youre gonna be so missed.

 youre gonna be a great father.

ROSS:
 well youre gonna be a wonderful grandma. 

RACHEL:
 hello?! i still dont know what the hell im doing!

ROSS:
 oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. youllyoure gonna pick it up.  you will! uh look, yknow when you first came to the city? you were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddys credit card. do you remember?

RACHEL:
 i hope youre going somewhere with this.

ROSS:
 look at you! whatyoure-youre this big executive! you are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. i-i have no doubt youre gonna be an incredible mother. 

RACHEL:
 really?

ROSS:
 im telling you.

RACHEL:
 thank you. 

 all right you two, im gonna get going.

ROSS:
 oh. 

 oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. ill let myself out. its like im not here, which i almost wasnt.

MONICA:
  what do i do?

PHOEBE:
 nothing! you have apologized to her like a million times and shes been nothing but terrible to you. and dont forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasnt even thanked you for it.

MONICA:
 yknow what? youre-youre right.

PHOEBE:
 yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her, id tell her off.

MONICA:
 really?

PHOEBE:
 uh-huh!

MONICA:
 okay! i will! mrs. green? mrs. green!   it is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! now what i did to you, it wasnt on purpose! but what youre during to me now is just plain spiteful!

 spiteful?!

MONICA:
 thats right! maybe its time you took a good hard look at a mirror young ladyold ladylady!

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 so whenever youre ready to apologize to me, i will forgive you. good day!   i cant feel my legs!

PHOEBE:
 you were fantastic! im so proud of you!

MONICA:
 yeah? im proud of me too.

PHOEBE:
 you should be!

MONICA:
 yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?

PHOEBE:
 you got it!

MONICA:
 okay.   mrs. green! okay im really sorry!! im apologizing for the   really sorry! closing credits 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 yes, ive done my studying and i really know my stuff.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 uh, put your elbow in it.

ROSS:
 excellent! how do you put a baby down for a nap?

RACHEL:
 full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.

ROSS:
 thats correct! this is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? 

RACHEL:
 check if its wet, check if its hungry, burp it!

ROSS:
 excellent! excellent, now-now do you want another question or a wicked wango card?

RACHEL:
 a card! a card! i pick a card!

ROSS:
 hey you guys i got some bad news.  

PHOEBE:
 well thats no way to sell newspapers. why dont you try, "extra! extra! read all about it!"

ROSS:
 no, monicas restaurant got a horrible review in the post.   i didnt want her to see it, so i ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies i could find. 

JOEY:
 man, this is bad! and ive had my share of bad reviews. i still remember my first good one though.  town was simply terrible. joey tribbiani was abysmal."

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

MONICA:
  it must be a good review! is it great?!

ROSS:
 umm

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 but the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.

MONICA:
 what about the rest of manhattan?!

ROSS:
 yeah, they all know.

MONICA:
 oh my god, this is horrible!

CHANDLER:
 im so sorry.

MONICA:
 im so humiliated!

RACHEL:
 yeah but yknow what they say mon, "theres no such thing as bad press."

MONICA:
 you dont think that umm,  was awful awful," is bad press?

RACHEL:
 i didnt write it.

MONICA:
 is he right? am i reallyam i awful?

 no!

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah monica! you listen to me, okay? and im not just saying this because im your friend, im sayin it cause its the truth. youre food is abysmal! opening credits

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:

JOEY:

MONICA:
 we said at the movies, but

JOEY:
 okay, ill see you there. 

MONICA:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 i have a job interview i have to get ready for.

JOEY:
 i thought you already have a job.

CHANDLER:
 and people say you dont pay attention. no, this is a much better job. its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.

JOEY:
 wow! how do you know how to do that?!

CHANDLER:
 thats what i do now.

MONICA:
 hey joey, come taste this.

JOEY:
 what is it?

MONICA:
 remember that guy that gave me a bad review? well   im getting my revenge!

JOEY:
 you cooked him?

MONICA:
 no. he teaches a course on food criticism at the new school, so before we go to the movies i wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. oh, i

 i was wrong about monica."

CHANDLER:
 the front page? you really do live in your own little world, dont ya? 

 do you uh, want these things delivered mr. and mrs. geller?

RACHEL:
 oh.

ROSS:
 oh.

RACHEL:
 no-no-no! no, no, no, were not married.

ROSS:
 we are having a baby together, but were not involved.   i mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. and then there was one drunken night.   or, yes stranger, wed like this delivered please.

 why dont you fill out this address card. 

ROSS:
 oh, okay.

 i notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! actually, thats one of the reasons why were not a couple.

ROSS:
 i chose those, im a paleontologist.

 really?! that is so cool!

RACHEL:
 oh. oh yeah, dont get to worked up over it. i mean it-it sounds like hes a doctor, but hes not.

 oh no-no, im fascinated by paleontology. have you read the new walter alvarez book?

ROSS:
 yeah! i-i teach it in my class.

RACHEL:
 oh my god! im standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and im bored.

  theres a great gym right around the corner from your building.

ROSS:
 thats my gym.

 i can tell you work out.   a paleontologist who works out, youre like indiana jones.  

ROSS:
 i am like indiana jones. 

RACHEL:
 hi pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 hey! oh, how did baby shopping go?

RACHEL:
 oh, it was great! we got everything that we needed! oh and ross, almost got something that wasnt on the list. a whore.

PHOEBE:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.

PHOEBE:
 well did she know you two werent married?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!

RACHEL:
 you dont understand! you didnt see how brazen she was.

PHOEBE:
 sounds like youre a little jealous.

RACHEL:
 no! im not! i-i-i just think its wrong! its-its that imhere i am about to pop and hes out picking up some shop girl at sluts r us!

PHOEBE:
 is that a real place? 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 hey chandler, why so fancy?

CHANDLER:
 well, i got a job interview. its kinda a big deal too. its a lot more money and id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.

PHOEBE:
 wait, i think i know someone who does that.

CHANDLER:
 me! i do that. so seriously, do i look okay? im little nervous.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! you reallyyou look great.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, just dont get your hopes up.

CHANDLER:
 why not?

PHOEBE:
 well, the interview

CHANDLER:
 what about it?

PHOEBE:
 yknow! you dont make a very good first impression.

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 oh you dont know.

CHANDLER:
 are you serious?!

PHOEBE:
 yes, when i first met you, you were like, "blah, blah, blah." i was like, shhh!

CHANDLER:
 what is it that i do?

PHOEBE:
 well its just like youre trying too hard. always making jokes, yknow, you justyou come off a little needy.

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 chandler, im not gonna lie to ya, but i am gonna run away from you.   

MONICA:
 hi! umm, im monica geller, im the chef at alessandros.

 still?

MONICA:
 i think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and i would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.

 i dont see any reason why i would do that to myself again.

JOEY:
 either eat it, or be in it.

MONICA:
 spoon? 

 im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. but i must be honest, your soap is abysmal.  

JOEY:
 thata girl! huh? we should get out of here; theres a new class comin in. 

 welcome to introduction to cooking. now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?  

MONICA:
 i can.

 okay, go ahead.

MONICA:
 well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. 

 thats very good, whats your name?

MONICA:
 monica.

 monica, you go to the head of the class.

MONICA:
 okay.   

RACHEL:
 all this stuff takes up a lot of room. hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping ben in your life?

ROSS:
 my son? pretty serious.   oh hey katie! 

 well, the delivery went out to you and i realized they forgot this.  

ROSS:
 ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.

 listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.

ROSS:
 oh.  

 oh uhi actually came here to ask you out.

ROSS:
 oh! wow! uh, yeah! that sounds great. im just gonna put this   back in my pocket, pretend that didnt happen. uh yeah, actually im free now. do you wanna grab some coffee or

 sure!

RACHEL:
 horny bitch.   no! youre a horny bitch! noooo! youre the horny bitch! no! youre a horny bitch! commercial break 

RACHEL:
 so you guys go, have a really good time.

ROSS:
   because im-im into s&m.  not-im not into anything weird. yknow? just-just normal sex.   so, im gonna grab my coat.  

RACHEL:
 so, you had a good day huh? big commission; picked up a daddy.

 are you okay with this?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! yeah please, you guys have fun.

 okay. it was nice to see you.

RACHEL:
 oh and it was great to see you too. and you look fantastic, although you missed a button.

 oh umm, actually i umm

RACHEL:
 oh okay, i see what youre doing there. 

CHANDLER:
 i cant even believe this! i really come off that badly?

PHOEBE:
 oh! its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.

CHANDLER:
 oh good. good, because im sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.

PHOEBE:
 all right, dont freak out! okay? i-i will help you. how long before you have to leave?

CHANDLER:
 an hour.

PHOEBE:
 i cant help you.

CHANDLER:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 all right, all right, well just do our best. okay? so lets say im the interviewer and im meeting you for the first time. okay. "hi! come on in, im uh, regina philange."

CHANDLER:
 chandler bing.

PHOEBE:
 bing, what an unusual name.

CHANDLER:
 well you should meet my uncle, bada.  

JOEY:
 hi.

 your fettuccini alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?

JOEY:
 when you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?

 and the cream?

JOEY:
 cheese makes me thirsty.

 okay. lets move on.

JOEY:
 all right.

  station!  youve never made this before?

MONICA:
 oh no! i dont know anything about cooking. i had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.

 well, hats off to the chef.

MONICA:
 i-i-im sorry, your-your mouth was full, i didnt hear what you said. umm, hats off to who now?

 the chef!

MONICA:
 thats right.  

CHANDLER:
 i think youll find if i come to work here, i dont micro-manage. i dont shy away from delegating.

PHOEBE:
 um-hmm, thats good to know. but lets stop focusing on what you dont do, and start focusing on what you do do.

CHANDLER:
  atmosphere of support for the people working with me.

PHOEBE:
 i see. nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.

CHANDLER:
 hardest thing ive ever done in my life.

PHOEBE:
 you gotta go!

CHANDLER:
 oh! 

PHOEBE:
 okay, dont worry. youre ready.

CHANDLER:
 really?

PHOEBE:
 absolutely! just fight all your natural instincts and youll be great.

CHANDLER:
 okay.  

 ah monica, my star student.

MONICA:
 yknow, you called me that before so i-i took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. 

  

MONICA:
 wow! a star!  im sorry, but i dont care. 

 okay joey, youre up next.  this are good! this is amazing! you get an a!

JOEY:
 i can an a? in-in school? 

MONICA:
 joey! im so proud of you!

 i think you should give him your star.

MONICA:
 excuse me? he doesnt even know what hes doing!

 were all beginners here. nobody knows what theyre doing.

MONICA:
 i do! im a professional chef!  its not a courtroom drama!

 if youre a professional chef, what are you doing taking introduction to cooking?

JOEY:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 im-im sorry, its just that umm well i-i cook at this restaurant, alessandros, and umm i just got a really bad review

 oh alessandros! i love that place!

MONICA:
 you do?

 oh yes! youre an excellent chef! as a person youre a little

MONICA:
 oh, im totally crazy, but you-you like the food?

 very much.

MONICA:
 okay then, i dont stink. im a good chef. okay.  

JOEY:
 whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! i dont want to go. im having fun.

 well actually, did either of you pay for this class?

JOEY:
 hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go.  

CHANDLER:
 also i was the point person on my companys transition from the kl-5 to gr-6 system.

 you mustve had your hands full.

CHANDLER:
 that i did. that i did.

 so lets talk a little bit about your duties.

CHANDLER:
 

 now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.

CHANDLER:
 

 but therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.

CHANDLER:
 

 we can go into detail

CHANDLER:
 no dont i beg of you!

 all right then, well have a definite answer for you on monday, but i think i can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.

CHANDLER:
 

 absolutely.  great.

CHANDLER:
 yeah i gotta say thank you, i was really nervous. yknow ive been told i come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.   duties! 

 poo?

CHANDLER:
 oh my god this doesnt count! okay? the interview was over, that was the real chandler bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! call security! theres a crazy guy out in the hall!

 poo?!

CHANDLER:
 ill look forward to your call.  

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hi! youre back from your date!

ROSS:
 how are you?

RACHEL:
 im fine, but thats not important. whats important is how was she?

ROSS:
 uhh, it was fun. we, we just had coffee.

RACHEL:
 oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.

ROSS:
 whats uh, whats going on? do you not, do you not like katie?

RACHEL:
 no! no, shesshe was nice. i mean, shes a little slutty, but who isnt?

ROSS:
 i liked her.

RACHEL:
 of course you did ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you indiana jones!

ROSS:
 did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!

RACHEL:
 no! its just that, kate bothered me. 

ROSS:
 why? what was wrong with her?

RACHEL:
 there was nothing wrong with her! all right? she was perfectly lovely!

ROSS:
 okay, so whats the matter?

RACHEL:
 i dont want you to date her!

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 yes! and not because i want you to go out with me, but because i dont want you to go out with anybody! okay? i know its a terrible thing to even think this, and its completely inappropriate, but i want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! im very sorry, but that is just the way that i feel.

ROSS:
 okay.

RACHEL:
 what?!

ROSS:
 i wont date. ill uh, ill be here, with you, all the time.

RACHEL:
 really? but im being so unreasonable.

ROSS:
 true, but youre allowed to be unreasonable. youre having our baby. 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 do you feel better?

RACHEL:
 no, not really. youre pressing the baby into my bladder and now i have to pee. sorry. 

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?  

RACHEL:
 you. like you havent done enough.

ROSS:
 look, i-i know how miserable you are, i wish there was something i can do. i mean i wish i were a seahorse.  male, they carry the babies. and then also umm, id be far away in the sea.    the room theyve made with his arm and decides its not enough and they all move 

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 oh i know, ive been there. i remember toward the end

CHANDLER:
 lets.  opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 hey! did you have the baby yet?

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 they sent me home from work. they were like, "start your maternity leave now! just rest, get ready for the baby." well yknow what? screw em! if they dont want me there, ill just hang out with you guys.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

JOEY:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 you said you didnt want to go.

RACHEL:
 i dont. but i would still like to be acknowledged. what? just because im pregnant you think im invisible.

JOEY:
 definitely not invisible.

MONICA:
 well, well ross didnt care enough to be here, so i think hes out. you snooze you lose.

CHANDLER:
 hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.

MONICA:
 well then somebodys snoozing. joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, i was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. 

CHANDLER:
 i havent seen this dress.

MONICA:
 star in a movie.

PHOEBE:
 joey, you pick who ever you want. okay? you just listen to your heart. what does it tell you? 

JOEY:
 well uhi think i want to take chandler.

PHOEBE:
  phoebe-phoebe-phoebe-phoebeburrrrr!  

CHANDLER:
 you really want to take me?

JOEY:
 yeah! yeah! i mean im sorry, i wish i can take everybody, but yknow chandler always supported my career. hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.

CHANDLER:
 so youre never actually going to pay me back?

MONICA:
 wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youre gonna take him? joey, i dont think youre comprehending just how slutty this dress is!

JOEY:
 its not just the stuff he paid for, i mean its-its everything. yknow? he read lines with me. he-he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i didnt get parts that i really wanted. you always believed in me man. even, even when i didnt believe in myself.

CHANDLER:
 i always knew you were gonna make it. im so proud of you.

JOEY:
 thanks. that means a lot to me. 

PHOEBE:
 mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 

MONICA:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 people ask me why were not together, i just dont know what to tell them.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 uh, do you wanna go change first? the doctors keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry

RACHEL:
 no, im fine.

ROSS:
 really? you dont think thats a little inappropriate. 

PHOEBE:
 good god man dont anger it.

RACHEL:
 ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am somewhat comfortable.

ROSS:
 fine! fine! yknow what? whatever you want. okay? youre the mommy.

RACHEL:
 oh uh-uh pal! dont call me mommy! its bad enough you call your own mother that. 

MONICA:

JOEY:
  along." 

JOEY:
    

RACHEL:
 ross.

ROSS:
 yeah?

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 uh-huh.

RACHEL:
 when carol was pregnant with ben

ROSS:
 mmm?

RACHEL:
 were you this irritating?

ROSS:
 wow!

RACHEL:
 excuse me?!

ROSS:
 oh nothing. nothing! just uh, youve been a little short with me lately. im not trying to irritate you.

RACHEL:
 well then you just must have a natural talent for it.

ROSS:
 yknow what? the doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speak until then.

RACHEL:
  great!

ROSS:
 yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil! 

RACHEL:
 hi dr. long, how are you?

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 she has the drugs!

 well do a quick check.

RACHEL:
 okay. 

 so, eight days late huh?

RACHEL:
 yeah.

 you must be a little uncomfortable.

RACHEL:
 eh, just a tad.

 youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. it still could last a little while longer. if youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.

ROSS:
 do them!!

 actually, theyre things you can do. just some home remedies, but in my experience ive found that some of them are quite effective.

RACHEL:
 well, we are ready to try anything.

 okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.

RACHEL:
 okay.

 you can take some caster oil, theres eating spicy foods

RACHEL:
 great! we will do all of those.

 taking a long walk, and then theres the one thats

 sex. 

ROSS:
 youve got to be kidding me! commercial break  

CHANDLER:
 good job joe! well done! top notch!

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 oh-ho-ho, yeah!

JOEY:
 which part exactly?

CHANDLER:
 the whole thing! can we go?

JOEY:
 oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.

CHANDLER:
 i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!

JOEY:
 hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did-did you like that part?

CHANDLER:
 i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic.

JOEY:
 you fell asleep!! there was no kangaroo! they didnt take any of my suggestions! thats for coming buddy. ill see you later. 

CHANDLER:
 dont go! im sorry. im so sorry!   look! this guy fell asleep! he fell asleep too! be mad at him!  

MONICA:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hi!

MONICA:
 what did the doctor say? any news on when the baby will come?

RACHEL:
 no. but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.

ROSS:
 yeah, we tried them all. we went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.

RACHEL:
 well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinks that, 

MONICA:
 well what is it? what is it? if its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. i mean, i think you should do it.

ROSS:
 its sex.

MONICA:
 do it!

ROSS:
 monica!

MONICA:
 im just saying its been a really long time for you. i mean, women have needs. do it, get yours!

PHOEBE:
 oh i-i dont know about that. no, i think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. 

MONICA:
 all right, lets be practical, if ross isnt willing to do it, hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. you can borrow chandlerchandler is good!

ROSS:
 monica, what is the matter with you?

MONICA:
 nothing. i just want the baby to be born today.

RACHEL:
 why? why today?

MONICA:
 okay fine! i keep betting phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and i dont want to lose again!

ROSS:
 what?! while shes been going through this hell, youve been making money?! youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?!  

RACHEL:
 ill take that bet.

ROSS:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 well, im miserable here! i might as well make some money out it!

ROSS:
 can i get some of that action?

MONICA:
 wait a minute! now im betting against all three of you?

RACHEL:
 oh honey, dont worry. i really do feel like tomorrows the day.

MONICA:
 oh, okay!  

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 uh-huh look, the only reason i can over here was to settle things between us! okay? youve done a lot for me and my career, i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it! okay, so how much do i owe you?

CHANDLER:
 what?!

JOEY:
 give me a number, i dont want to owe you anything!

CHANDLER:
 you dont owe me anything, i dont want you money

JOEY:
 ah-ah-ah! were doing this! okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. right, how much were those?

CHANDLER:
 i dont know, five hundred dollars?

JOEY:
 okay, five hundred dollars. what else?

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 okay, so thats another five hundred. five hundred and five hundred, thats 

CHANDLER:
 do you want a calculator?

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes

JOEY:
 which were still keeping under our hats!

CHANDLER:
 uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. which after twenty hours of lessons still came out jamaican. 

JOEY:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 i am feeling nothing. speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh come on ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! we know whats gonna work! its doctor recommended!

ROSS:
 im sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! my god, im dying.

RACHEL:
 oh come on ross, weve done it before well do it again, itll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.

ROSS:
 this is insane, im not gonna make love to you just so that youll go into labor.

RACHEL:
 make love? what are you a girl?

ROSS:
 always a great way to get in a mans pants.

RACHEL:
 but you will, you will be performing a service. okay? just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, yknow you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.

ROSS:
 i love when you talk dirty to me.

RACHEL:
 oh, i know it. youre right. thats not sexy. ohoh!  over and get it. 

ROSS:
 okay enough! this is, this is not going to happen.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 we could, or we can have sex in it.

CHANDLER:
 well let me think about that, while i remove my pants! 

MONICA:
  

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 hey!

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

 chandler bing!

CHANDLER:
 jan-janice!

ROSS:

 its you. this is yours.

CHANDLER:
 what?!

  years! 

CHANDLER:
 thats funny. does it-does it hurt? does the labor hurt? 

PHOEBE:
 okay ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?

 id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least i can explain to him that youre making me eat him.

PHOEBE:
 somebody went to college. wow.  im sorry. 

 no, im sorry. its just my foot itches like crazy.

PHOEBE:
 oh, ill get it. 

 wow! i usually get to know a girl a little better before i let her spoon me.

PHOEBE:
 relax, its not like were forking.  

RACHEL:
 oh thats five ross. five women have had five babies! and i have had no babies! why doesnt she want to come out?

ROSS:
 yknow what i think it is? i think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.

RACHEL:
 oh. look at you making up crap for me. oh god!  

 twenty-one hours, youre a hero.

RACHEL:
 doctor you gotta do something! i think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.

 actually, i think youre ready to go to the delivery room.

RACHEL:
 what?

 ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.

RACHEL:
 my god. okay.  

 is this the same spoon that was in my cast? 

PHOEBE:
 yknow what? this one is.  

 oh my god! thats the doctor who was in my room before!

PHOEBE:
 huh. okay, mr. perkazet.

 im telling you! the guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!

PHOEBE:
 cliff, do you really believe that a character from a tv show was here in your room?

JOEY:
   which is of no interest to me, im a neurologist.

 that-thats him! you know him?

PHOEBE:
 okay. okay. iokay ummthisi-i sent my friend joey in here to find out stuff about you. umm yknow, if it helps you came off great. a lot better than im coming off right now.

 i dont believe this. you got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?

JOEY:
 fake? excuse me? hello? 

 and then you tried to make me think that i was crazy.

PHOEBE:
 youre right, that was wrong. im sorry. im so sorry. its just that i liked you so much. can we just, can we just start over?

 i dont think so.

JOEY:
 uh, if i may? umm-umm look, cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? and maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. uh, she gave birth to her brothers triplets. oh! oh! her-her twin sister used to do porn!

PHOEBE:
 uh joey, were trying to dial down the crazy.

JOEY:
 right!

PHOEBE:
 umm, look we dont, we dont really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. and i dont know about you but that doesnt happen to me a lot.

 it doesnt happen to me either.

JOEY:
 me neither. 

 push. push. come on push for five seconds. 54

RACHEL:
 3-2-1 oh!!

 okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.

RACHEL:
 i cant. i cant push anymore, i cant.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 oh god twenty seconds my ass!!

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:
 oh thank god, i thought she had two heads.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

JOEY:
 oh no-no, no for i second there i counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so were good.

PHOEBE:
 okay, my turn. my turn.  cute! oh, i could squeeze your little head!  

MONICA:
 whats the matter?

RACHEL:
 oh nothing i sorry, i just cant stop crying.

ROSS:
 the doctor says its completely normal with all the hormones. plus, you-youre sleep deprived.

RACHEL:
 so? you guys are all sleep deprived. i dont see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. oh god. 

JOEY:
 whats the matter now?

RACHEL:
 i was reliving it.

PHOEBE:
 ohhh. 

CHANDLER:
 so, do you know what youre gonna call her yet?

PHOEBE:
 oh, wait a minute its not gonna be baby girl? i thought that was so original! 

ROSS:
 uh actually, we-weve narrowed it down to two names.

RACHEL:
 yeah, and yknow what? i love them both, so why dont you just pick one and thatll be it.

ROSS:
 wow! umm, okay uheveryonethisis isabella.   what?

RACHEL:
 thats not her name! im sorry, she just doesnt feel like an isabella.

CHANDLER:
 so then i guess ferdinad is out.

JOEY:
 what was the other one ross?

ROSS:
 umm, delilah.

RACHEL:
 oh great! suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.

ROSS:
 so i guess were back to uh, baby girl.

PHOEBE:
 yay!

RACHEL:
 well what are we going to do?

MONICA:
 its okay honey, youll find a name.

ROSS:
 ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 yeah, ive had them picked out since i was fourteen.

CHANDLER:
 oh no, its gonna be named after some snack or baked good isnt it?

RACHEL:
 well tell us! what are they?

MONICA:
 umm, okay. if its a boy its daniel.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh, im not doing it alone. i have ross.

 oh, sure. now. but what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?

RACHEL:
 well then he gets a divorce, its ross!

 im telling you rachel, listen to janice. they all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.

RACHEL:
 well ithats never gonna happen with ross.

 oh well thats what i thought about my first husband, now im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little ms. new boobs.

RACHEL:
 really?

 i hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two  your own.

RACHEL:
 well thatsyknowthatsweve been alone for the last twenty minutes were doing okay. besides yknow what? i-imaybe we wont be alone, cause lately i-ithings have been happening between me and ross, yknow? right before i went into labor, we-we had this kiss. yknow? so it might be thethe beginning of something.

ROSS:
 

 oh hi!

ROSS:
 whos this little guy? 

 say hello to aaron, your future son-in-law.

ROSS:
 no-no. no.

 im gonna leave the three of you alone.

ROSS:

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 uh-huh.  what i was, i was thinking about?

ROSS:
 huh?

RACHEL:
 ummthat kiss before we left the apartment. that was some-something huh?

ROSS:
 yeah. yeah, it really was. but wewe gotta be careful. wewe cant let that happen again, yknow?

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i mean we dont want to go down that road do we?

RACHEL:
 no! no, of course not. no. thats why i brought it up.  didnt have any sodas?

ROSS:
 oh my god! im sorry, i was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 yeah. shes putting her down now, thats her.  

PHOEBE:
 oh!

ROSS:
 look at emma!

PHOEBE:
 i just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or rachel?

ROSS:
 oh what are you kidding? shes gorgeous, its all rachel. 

PHOEBE:
 im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again?  which would be fine, except you totally are.

ROSS:
 itsits complicated okay?

PHOEBE:
 yeah thats true. yeah, you love her. you always have. you have a child together. there is no right answer.

ROSS:
 look, weve been together. okay? and then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  and it didnt work outi could never do that to emma. i mean she-she thinking everything the water in this place? since rachel and i were doing really, were doing really well right now.

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:

ROSS:

 well of course ben, i meant my first granddaughter.   wow.

PHOEBE:
  rachel?

ROSS:
 oh well yeah, actually i was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.

PHOEBE:
 yay! its so exciting! wow, you couldve done that with us there.

ROSS:
 yeah right.

PHOEBE:
 oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you cant talk to rachel.

ROSS:
 what?! when have i ever touched myself in front of you guys?

PHOEBE:
 oh please! just before when you were asleep in the lounge! that armenian family was watching you instead of the tv. oh, that reminds me. that mr. hasmeje still has my gameboy.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 sure.

JOEY:
 dude i just did something terrible.

CHANDLER:
 that was you?! i thought it was jack!

JOEY:
 no! no, that was jack! rachel thinks i asked her to marry me!

CHANDLER:
 what?! why does she think that?

JOEY:
 because it kinda looked like i did.

CHANDLER:
 again, what?!

JOEY:
 okay well, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand

CHANDLER:
 as we all are at some point during the day.

JOEY:
 it wasnt my ring! it fell out of rosss jacket! and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing!

CHANDLER:
 ross had a ring?! and he was gonna propose?

JOEY:
 i guess.

CHANDLER:
 and you did it first?! this is gonna kill him! you know how much he loves to propose!

JOEY:
 i know! i know its awful.

CHANDLER:
 well, what did she say?

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 does ross know?

JOEY:
 oh god, what the hell am i going to tell him?

CHANDLER:
 well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.

JOEY:
 oh, i like that. yeah

CHANDLER:
 if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 i want a baby.

CHANDLER:
 honey, weve been over this. i need to be facing the other way.

MONICA:
 come on! come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. do you think that closets still available?

CHANDLER:
 im so tired.  foreplay.

MONICA:
 deal! 

ROSS:
 dad seriously! yknow you really should see someone about that!

 noted.

ROSS:
 i wanna go talk to rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

 are you kidding me, i could stay and look at her forever.

ROSS:
   

PHOEBE:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi.

PHOEBE:
 are you all right?

RACHEL:
 uhh i think i just got engaged.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! he did it?

RACHEL:
 welldid you know he was gonna ask me?

PHOEBE:
 are you kidding? im like the one who talked him into it. i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.

RACHEL:
 and you really think this is a good idea?

PHOEBE:
 i just talked him into it, dont tell me i have to do you too. the puppet master gets tired people.

RACHEL:
 i just dont know! it just doesnt feel right.

PHOEBE:
 why?! you two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.

RACHEL:
 really?! even ross?

PHOEBE:
 especially ross!

JOEY:
  come back later. 

ROSS:
 wow! kind of uh, kind of a full house here. ill guess justill come back. 

PHOEBE:
 there he goes, your fiancée. 

RACHEL:
 i guess so.

PHOEBE:
 although he does play with himself in his sleep.

RACHEL:
 i cant say that im surprised.  

ROSS:
 dad, what are you doing?

 i think there are people in there having sex. 

JOEY:
 it cant be me, im standing right here.

 wanna peek?

ROSS:
 no!

 come on!

ROSS:
 yknow what? i dont like you without mom.  

JOEY:
 

 well im peeking. 

CHANDLER:
 hello sir, you know monica.  

JOEY:
 hey uh, is it okay to come in?

RACHEL:
 of course! oh joey, this ring iits beautiful i love it!

JOEY:
 yeah uh look rach, theres something i gotta tell ya. 

RACHEL:
 hey!

 hey! are you ready to try nursing again?

RACHEL:
 yeah! hi emma. hey, why do you think she wont take my breast?

 its all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but dont worry. itll happen.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 okay sweetie, you can do it. just open up and put it in your mouth.

JOEY:
 dear lord.

RACHEL:
 im sorry honey, what were you saying?

JOEY:
 oh uh-uh yeah, i think that

RACHEL:
 oh look, shes pulling away again! do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  scared?

JOEY:
 yknow, i dont really know her.

 why dont we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.  

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 its just so frustrating! why doesnt she want my breast?!

JOEY:
 i dont know! maybe shes crazy!  

PHOEBE:
 oh hey! wait up!

ROSS:
 hi!

PHOEBE:
 congratulations! i didnt want to say anything in front of joey cause i didnt know if he knew yet.

ROSS:
 what, that we had a baby? come on lets give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.

PHOEBE:
 no! no, that you and rachel are engaged!

ROSS:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh, its a secret. oh goodie! yes! we havent done the secret thing in a long time.

ROSS:
 phoebe, there is no secret. okay? i didnt propose.

PHOEBE:
 are you lying? is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?

ROSS:
  talk to rachel myself.

PHOEBE:
 all right, me too.   should we wake her up?

ROSS:
 no! no, come on let her sleep! shes so exhausted.

PHOEBE:
 and so engaged. 

ROSS:
 what?  thinks were engaged! why? why? why would she think were engaged?!

PHOEBE:
 perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? yknow ross doctors are supposed to be smart.

ROSS:
 i didnt give her that ring!

PHOEBE:
 really?

ROSS:
 no!

PHOEBE:
 so whose ring is it?

ROSS:
 its mine.

PHOEBE:
 is it an engagement ring?

ROSS:
 yes!

PHOEBE:
 but you didnt give it to her?

ROSS:
 no!

PHOEBE:
 but you were going to propose?

ROSS:
 no!!

PHOEBE:
 huh, i might be losing interest in this.

ROSS:
 look. look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel, but all i wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again.

PHOEBE:
 oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

ROSS:
 look, i didnt want to rush into anything. and it seemed like she didnt want to either. but i dont, i dont understand how any of this happened! what? did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that i was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?

PHOEBE:
 no! no, she said you actually proposed to her.

ROSS:
 well i didnt! i didnt propose!  did i? i havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something i would do. commercial break  

CHANDLER:
 look, we cant stay in here forever.

MONICA:
 oh, i still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! he didnt make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!

CHANDLER:
 this is okay. were all adults here; theres nothing to be ashamed of. now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.  

MONICA:
 hi dad! i can still call you that right?

 of course. ill always be your dad.

CHANDLER:
 i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun.

MONICA:
 it wasnt fun?!

CHANDLER:
  look, i just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want.

 oh, i dont think that. before today i never thought of you two having sex at all. it was a simpler time.

MONICA:
 the truth is, dad, were-were trying.

 what?

MONICA:
 yeah, were trying to get pregnant.

 oh my god! this is so exciting! well, get back in there!   ill guard the door!

MONICA:
 well, thats okay dad, we-we can wait until later.

 whoa-whoa-whoa! i dont think so! arent you ovulating?

MONICA:
 daddy?!

 well you gotta get at it princess! when your mother and i were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. thats how i got my bad hip.

CHANDLER:
 thats funny, this conversations how i got the bullet hole in my head.

 this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was

MONICA:
 daddy! i dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.

 youre right, youre right. this is about your positions. now, what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.

MONICA:
 i dont feel good right now.

 but pleasure is important,  has an orgasm. you up to the task sailor?

CHANDLER:
 seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall. 

MONICA:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hey. i need to tell you something.

MONICA:
 well, nows a good time. im on my way to have my ears cut off.

RACHEL:
 joey asked me marry him.

MONICA:
 what?

RACHEL:
 joey proposed to me.

MONICA:
 is he crazy?! you just had rosss baby!

RACHEL:
 well, i-i said yes.

MONICA:
 what?! are you crazy? you just had rosss baby! its-its so inappropriate. no, its worse than that. its wrong. its it is bigger than mine! 

RACHEL:
 i know. days of our lives, thank you very much.

MONICA:
 you cant marry him!

RACHEL:
 why not? i dont want to do this alone! and hes such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.

MONICA:
 well do you love him?

RACHEL:
 sure.

MONICA:
 sure?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i mean whatever.

MONICA:
 honey, the question isdo you really want to marry joey?

RACHEL:
 no. no, i dont. could you be a dear and go tell him? 

CHANDLER:
 you still havent told rachel you werent really proposing?

JOEY:
 no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.

CHANDLER:
 joey, you have to tell her whats going on! and what did it look like?!

JOEY:
 i didnt look at it. stupid babys head was blocking most of it.

CHANDLER:
 go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out.

JOEY:
 look, its not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i dont want to hurt her.

CHANDLER:
 okay, look, just do it gently.

JOEY:
 youre right. youre right. i-ill go tell her now before ross finds out and ill be gentle. i can do that. i am a gentle person. oh, by the way. two people screwing in there  you want to check that out. 

ROSS:
 hey.

RACHEL:
 hey.

ROSS:
 listen, i um i heard about the engagement.

RACHEL:
 surprised?

ROSS:
 and confused. rach, sweetie, i-i umi didnt propose to you.

RACHEL:
 i know.

ROSS:
 i dont think you do.

RACHEL:
 you didnt propose to me. joey did.

ROSS:
 poor baby, youre so tired. rach, i didnt propose to you, joey didnt propose to you, and chandler didnt propose to you.

RACHEL:
 uh you didnt propose to me, chandler didnt propose to me, but joey did. 

ROSS:
 joey proposed to you?

JOEY:
 i can come back.

ROSS:
 hey, wait! wait-wait-wait! joey, did you propose to her?

JOEY:
 no.

RACHEL:
 yes you did!

JOEY:
 actually, technically, i didnt.

RACHEL:
 well then why did you give me a ring?

ROSS:
 wait! whoa-whoa, youyou gave her the ring?

JOEY:
 no! no, and i did not ask her to marry me!

RACHEL:
 yes, you did!

JOEY:
 no, i didnt!

RACHEL:
 yes, you did!

JOEY:
 no, i didnt!

RACHEL:
 yes, you did! and dont you say, "no, i didnt!"

JOEY:
 ahhh!

RACHEL:
 he was right there. he got down on one knee and proposed.

ROSS:
 whoa! you were down on one knee?

JOEY:
 yeah. yeah, that looks bad. but i didnti didnt propose!

ROSS:
 then what did happen?

RACHEL:
 yeah, what did happen?

JOEY:
 okay, the ring fell on the floor and i went down to pick it up and you thought i was proposing.

RACHEL:
 yeah, but you said, "will you marry me?"

JOEY:
 no, i didnt!

RACHEL:
 yes, you did!

JOEY:
 no, i didnt!

RACHEL:
 yes, you didoh my god you didnt!  didnt you tell me that before?!

JOEY:
 well i tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!

ROSS:
 whoa! hey! whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 well then joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!

JOEY:
 it wasnt my ring! its rosss ring! thats why i felt so bad rach, because he was going to propose.

ROSS:
 what?!

RACHEL:
 you were gonna propose to me?

ROSS:
 uhh no. 

JOEY:
 well, this is awkward. {see? i told you so.}

ROSS:
 but i-i was going to see if yknow, maybe you uh, start dating again but thati mean that-that was all, rach.

JOEY:
 dude, step up! i proposed.

ROSS:
 no, you didnt!

JOEY:
 oh thats right. theres a lot going on here and i think i ate some bad fruit earlier. 

 hey, she just woke up! shes hungry. why dont we give this another try?

RACHEL:
 okay.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 i cant believe youre not going to propose!

ROSS:
 hey, im not going to rush into anything!

JOEY:
 oh yeah, dude, i totally understand. usually after i have a baby with a woman i like to slow things down!

RACHEL:
 oh my god!

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 shes doing it look, shes breast-feeding look!

JOEY:
 

 ill come back for her later.

RACHEL:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 honey dont worry, it was my mistake.

JOEY:
 no, rach, i shouldve told you sooner. its just thatman! that kid is going to town! 

RACHEL:
 shes perfect.

ROSS:
 were so lucky.

RACHEL:
 we really are.

ROSS:
 look, i-i know its not a proposal and i dont know where you are, but with everything thats been going on and with emma andive been feeling

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 okay, well, that wow, okay, well, ummthen maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.

RACHEL:
 yeah, maybe.

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 wh-whats that?

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 im sorry, what?

ROSS:
 when you thought joey proposed diddid you say yes? closing credits  

 kids, i spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hey.

ROSS:
 you said youd marry joey?

RACHEL:
 okay you have to realize, i was exhausted, i was emotional, i would have said yes to anybody. like that time you and i got married! 

ROSS:
 so you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?

RACHEL:
 that is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but i am prepared to let that go.

ROSS:
 so when i came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.

RACHEL:
 wellreally? i thought chandler was your best friend.

ROSS:
 well, chandlers my oldest friend, but joeys myno! ah! 

RACHEL:
 ooooo!

JOEY:
  guys know, say goodbye.

ROSS:
 rachel said shed marry you?!

JOEY:
   opening credits  and rachel to come home and monica is looking at the sign phoebe bought that says, 

MONICA:
 ok, i dont wanna be negative so ill say that most of the signs you bought are good.

PHOEBE:
 no they ran out of "its a girl" but i can fix this one, 

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 yea yea. 

MONICA:
 honey why dont you go lie down.

CHANDLER:
 no, no, ross and rachel will be back soon and then i gotta go to the office 

JOEY:
 whyre you so tired?

CHANDLER:
 couldnt sleep last night you know, then i started worrying about this big divisional meeting that i have later today, the more i worried about it the more i couldnt sleep.  yknow? i was like, if i fall asleep now ill get six hours sleep, but if i fall asleep now ill get five hours sleep. not matter what i did i couldnt fall asleep.

JOEY:
 you know what you shouldve done, you should have told yourself that little story.

RACHEL:
 

 hi, welcome home!

MONICA:

RACHEL:
 oh you guys thanks for doing this.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 is he still mad at us?

RACHEL:
 well, you more then me, but he cant stay to mad at me. i mean, i just had his baby.

JOEY:
 thats not fair! i cant do that.

RACHEL:
 yeah, im not so sure you should be here when he comes up.

JOEY:
 see this is what i was afraid of, i didnt think i should be here either but somebody 

CHANDLER:
 hey, what do i know? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla. 

 the numbers we are seeing new york, chicago, and london are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields. 

 boston is down, atlanta is down, houston is down, i could go on and on but instead of boring you ill go straight to my forty two point plan.  

CHANDLER:
 walter   

PHOEBE:
 shes just so cute! i just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.

MONICA:

ROSS:

JOEY:
  fine, fine okay.  but i gotta say technically, i didnt even do anything wrong.

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 i said i didnt technically.

ROSS:

JOEY:
 look, can i just stop you right there for a second? when people do this   you were saying?

ROSS:
 and i can even understand that you couldnt tell rachel, but why couldnt you tell me, huh? you had all day to and you didnt.

 wait a minute, you can't go to tulsa. maybe you forgot,   but we've got tickets to the jets game next week.

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry buddy, but i don't think i'm gonna be   able to make it.

JOEY:
 we were gonna go see the jets!

ROSS:
 you can't go, i mean you're the glue that holds this   group together!

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

JOEY:

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 thank you joey. you know what? i'm not even sure   i can have caffeine.

ROSS:
 i went thru this with ben and carol. one cup of coffee   won't affect your milk.

RACHEL:
 yeah. just to be sure i'm gonna call dr. wiener. 

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 every time?  

JOEY:
 uhuh.

ROSS:
 rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little   question, okay? trust me, i know this.

RACHEL:
 all right, i trust you. 

ROSS:
 rachel, i can see you dialing! i don't understand why...

RACHEL:
 i'm on the phone!  

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 it's so weird seeing ross and rachel with a baby.   it's just so grown up.

JOEY:
 i know, yeah. i feel like we're all growing up. person   named wiener, god that kills me. 

PHOEBE:
 look at you all grown up.

JOEY:
 actually, you know what? i am. that whole thing with   rachel made me realize that maybe i'm ready for a more serious relationship.   you know? like i'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. and looks   aren't as important as...nah, she's gotta be hot.

PHOEBE:
 you know, i might know somebody. hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date!

JOEY:
 i can do that, yeah. how is friday?

PHOEBE:
 done. oh good, really?

JOEY:
 yeah! 

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah... all right, well that rules out lana titweiller

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 i've got good news!

MONICA:
 you got out of the whole tulsa thing?

CHANDLER:
 okay, i have news. you don't have to move to tulsa.   you can stay here and keep your job. 

MONICA:
 it's great! how? chandler. well my boss and i worked out a deal where i only   have to be in tulsa four days a week, so the other three i can be here with   you.

MONICA:
 so you're gonna be gone four days a week?   no.

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?

MONICA:
 no. i can't be away from you for that long.

CHANDLER:
 really?

MONICA:
 yeah, you're my husband. i'm not gonna live in a   different state than you for 208 days out of the year.

CHANDLER:
 that's fast math! we could use you in tulsa. 

MONICA:
 honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but   if you're going to tulsa, i wanna go with you.

CHANDLER:
 hey, you said that without gagging!

MONICA:
 i know!  

RACHEL:
  too! 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 dr. wiener. 

ROSS:
 rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. 

RACHEL:
 oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!

ROSS:
 was there anything you did wrong with emma?

RACHEL:
 yes, of course there is! okay? i'm not insane!

ROSS:
 well, what was it?

RACHEL:
 hiccups.

ROSS:
 rach, i told you, you can't call him every time any   little thing comes up. 

RACHEL:
 yeah well, not anymore i can't. he fired us! what   are we gonna do? we have to find a pediatrician. wait wait, monica said that   when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. what was his name?

ROSS:
 dr. gettleman? yeah i know, i don't think that's a   good idea. in fact, i think he's dead.

RACHEL:
 argh! why does everything happen to me?!

ROSS:
 rach, i promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another   doctor, but i gotta get up early and i'm not feeling all that well.

RACHEL:
 what? what, do you mean you're not feeling well?   what do you have? is it rubella? because don't go near emma, she has not had   that shot.

ROSS:
 you know? come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like!   

RACHEL:
   wiener, wiener 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 great! now he's gonna know it was me! 

PHOEBE:
 

JOEY:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 so how is this for our big double date tonight?  

JOEY:
   oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 ooh, great! just the reaction i was hoping for. 

JOEY:
 yeah, so you found someone for me. you didn't forget? 

PHOEBE:
 of course not! and you're gonna love mary ellen.   she's really smart and cute and funny, and i can't tell you how i know this,   but she' not opposed to threesomes. so tell me some about my guy. 

JOEY:
 no.

PHOEBE:
 come on, give me something. what's his name?

JOEY:
 mike.

PHOEBE:
 mike? okay! what's his last name?

JOEY:
 damnit! is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?

PHOEBE:
 all right, we'll se you and mike at the restaurant   in a couple hours.

 

JOEY:
 why did i have to say mike? i don't know a mike! why   couldn't i have said...    there!  

RACHEL:
 it's impossible to find a good doctor. i mean, how   do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against   your knee?

MONICA:
 excuse me?

CHANDLER:
 i know what she's talking about.

RACHEL:
 we've got to find a new pediatrician. ross was getting   sick last night, and i think emma may have caught it.

MONICA:
 why don't you go see dr. gettleman? 

RACHEL:
 ross said he died. 

MONICA:
 he didn't die. i saw his daughter last week. said   he was fine. her on the other hand, botched botox.

RACHEL:
 oh, great! well, then i'm gonna take emma to see   him. i wonder why ross said that he died.

MONICA:
 oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist.

CHANDLER:
 he saw a therapist?

MONICA:
 yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just   really freaked him out.

RACHEL:
 why? what was it?

MONICA:
 that i was going to eat him.   

JOEY:
 mike!!!

 yeah? 

JOEY:
   

 i gotta tell you, i can't believe i'm doing this with   you. although i did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so i guess i   should be open and taking some risks.

JOEY:
 everything is gonna be fine. just follow my lead, okay?   all you have to do is pretend to be mike.

 i am mike.

JOEY:
 atta boy!  

JOEY:
 okay, look...

 

PHOEBE:
 joey, this is mary ellen jenkins. so, mike, how do   you and joey know each other anyway?

 how do i and joey know each other? wow, if i had a   nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.

JOEY:
 

 yeah, we met in college.    high school.

PHOEBE:
 wow, you guys go way back then. so what are you up   to these days?

 well, i'm a lawyer.

JOEY:
 mike, 'attorney at law'!

 actually, i just gave up my practice.

JOEY:
 what? that's the kinda thing you usually run by me.

 i always wanted to play piano professionally, and i   figured if i don't do this now, i never will.

PHOEBE:
 wow, that's great! i liked that better than the law   thing, so...

JOEY:
 which is why i waited until now to introduce you to   mike.

 i thought you thought he was still a lawyer.

JOEY:
 no, no, that's not what i meant. let's get you a cocktail.   

MONICA:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa.

MONICA:
 that's so sweet. find anything?

CHANDLER:
 slim pickings.

MONICA:
 nothing, huh?

CHANDLER:
 no, 'slim pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.   they're looking for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they're   looking for someone to shovel mesquite. 

MONICA:
 'slim pickings'...that is so cheesy.

CHANDLER:
 'so cheesy' also has an opening.

MONICA:
 honey, that's okay. i actually know this woman, nancy,   who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. maybe she'll know of something.

CHANDLER:
 can i just say how much i appreciate you coming   with me. when we get to tulsa i'm taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings'.   'so cheesy'? 'whole hog'? it's going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa.

MONICA:
    good. listen, i'm looking for a job in tulsa. well yeah, my husband has been   relocated...because i love him! no, i don't want a job in new york. javo    is looking? oh my god! he asked for me personally? oh my god! oh, wow, this   is really flattering, but i'm moving to tulsa. yeah, so if you would tell javo    

RACHEL:
 hi, my name is rachel green, i have an appointment   for emma.

 dr. gettleman is finishing up with a patient,   he should be out shortly.

    it's definitely not strep.

ROSS:
 thanks doctor.

 would you like a lollypop?

ROSS:
 you even have to ask?!    

PHOEBE:
 you know, it's so surprising that you and joey have   known each other for so long and i've never heard about you.

JOEY:
 yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.   mike hit my mom with a car.

 no, i didn't.

JOEY:
 that's okay mike, i have forgiven you. and now we're   friends again everything's great! mary ellen wait, is your mom okay?

JOEY:
 please, we're trying to have a conversation.  

 wow, you're a lot nicer on 'days of our lives'.

 'days of our lives'! that's why you look so familiar!

PHOEBE:
 what?!

 what?!

JOEY:
 what?!

PHOEBE:
 do you not know each other?

JOEY:
    we used to play in high school. yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.   we played all kinds of games.    you in the face for not being cool?!

PHOEBE:
 mike, let me ask you something. how many sisters   does joey have?

 

JOEY:
 what are you doing? i said seven!    

PHOEBE:
 joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?

JOEY:
 because i forgot about our date, i'm so sorry.

 i'm sorry too. and just to be clear, i didn't hit his   mother with a car.

PHOEBE:
    finding the perfect girl for you, you know. mary ellen is really smart and   cute and loose.

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 who are you kidding?    guy off the street for me? oh god! this is humiliating!

JOEY:
 look phoebe i'm so sorry! hey, look, if you don't like   this guy i can find you a better one. 

PHOEBE:
 i'm out of here 

 it was nice meeting you!

JOEY:
 

 i'll stay if you can tell me my name.

JOEY:
 good night!  

CHANDLER:
 honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got   a lot of packing to do.

MONICA:
 you're right. 

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,   javo 

CHANDLER:
 how far outside?

MONICA:
 manhattan.

CHANDLER:
 and you're thinking of taking it?    you said being me with me was more important than any job, but i guess now   it's old job, 

MONICA:
 i'm gonna miss this hand! okay i know it's a lot   to ask, but oh my god chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

CHANDLER:
 what happened to 'you can't live without me four   days a week'?

MONICA:
 well, if you really think about it, i mean four days   is not that long. i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see   you thursday when you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really   if you think about it, it's really just one day. and well, if we can't make   it one day, we've got real problems my friend.

CHANDLER:
 i think you should take the job.

MONICA:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. i know it must be important to you when you   start chattering like a monkey.

MONICA:
 that's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!  

ROSS:
 hey!

MONICA:
 how was the pediatrician?

RACHEL:
 oh, i really liked him.    was really, really, really good.

ROSS:
 you promised you wouldn't say anything.

RACHEL:
 i know.    

MONICA:
 are you serious? you still see dr. gettleman?

ROSS:
 he's a brilliant diagnostician!

CHANDLER:
 diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

RACHEL:
 ross, seriously! you've gotta go to an appropriate   doctor.

ROSS:
 why? why? i know it's a little weird, but hey, he's   a great doctor, okay? he knows my medical history, and every time i go in there,   he makes a big deal. 'ah look, it's my favorite patient!'

CHANDLER:
 does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy?

ROSS:
 hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!

CHANDLER:
 that was not a security blanket! that was a wall-hanging!

ROSS:
 it didn't spend much time on the wall!!! 

 excuse me, hi. i was hoping i would run into you. can   we talk?

PHOEBE:
 sure.

 i'm sorry, really, i'm so embarrassed. really, i'm   a pretty nice guy. just ask my parole officer...apparently i'm not a funny   guy.

PHOEBE:
 why did you go along with that?

 because i was told i'd get a free dinner, which i didn't.   and that i'd meet a pretty girl. which i did.

PHOEBE:
 that's true.    about yourself true?

 my name in mike, and i do play piano.

PHOEBE:
 prove it.

 there isn't a piano here.

PHOEBE:
 that wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.

 

PHOEBE:
 you are really good! i play a little guitar myself.

 really?

PHOEBE:
 uhuh.

 that's great. what kind of music do you play?

PHOEBE:
 well, like acoustic folksy stuff. you know? but right   now i'm working on a couple 'iron maiden' covers. 

 do you think that maybe, sometime, i could...

PHOEBE:
 it's okay. go ahead, ask me out.

 okay. do you think maybe sometime i could take you   out?

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
    that would be nice.

JOEY:
 look at this. my two best friends!   

ROSS:
 excuse me, i don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby   with the rash came in after me.

 the doctor will be right with you sir.

 

ROSS:
 with the circus? he's behind the elephant.

 wow, so your child is a big fan of the waldo books   too?

ROSS:
 yeah, that's how i know. i'm ross by the way.

 hi, i'm sally. so, no ring. can i assume you are also   a single parent?

ROSS:
 i am a single parent.

 it's hard isn't it? there's almost no time for a social   life. i mean, where are you gonna meet someone?

ROSS:
 well, let's say, i don't know, you met someone in the   pediatrician's office.

 

ROSS:
 hmm, yeah.    on ross jr. it's time to go in.

 mommy 

 mommy, what's wrong with that man?

ROSS:
 hey, i helped you find waldo!  

ROSS:
 

MONICA:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 i'm mad at you for leaving! you're nothing but a big   leaver. big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

CHANDLER:
 any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make   all this easier?

JOEY:
 dude, you see right thru me!!  

CHANDLER:
 well, bye mon, bye ross, rachel, bye emma!

PHOEBE:
 okay, bye-bye!    trip! 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:
 oh no yeah, no phoebe is great, but umm i'm an idiot   look right before you guys went out i accidentally got her all upset.

 that's why she was weird.

ROSS:

 i'm not blowing her off, i actually just got off the   phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, i mean i hope that's ok with   you stranger from the coffee house.

ROSS:
 well then i didn't need to bother you or the four   other mike hanagens i bothered.

 hey wait wait wait wait wait! is that true what you   said phoebe's never had a serious relationship?

ROSS:
 of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship   i'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.

 but you did say it

ROSS:
 yes, yes i did. and i will also say what i'm about   to say vis-à-vis the following phoebe has never had a serious relationship   since her. super-serious relationship with. vicrum.

 vicrum?

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
    sweeping down the plane, stop it! why couldn't they have sent me to texas?   7 o clock maybe i'll hit the gym    porn.  -cuts to monica  

CHANDLER:
 do not disturb do not disturb! monica: 

MONICA:
: is everything all right?

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
: i'm gonna go freshen up ok

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 man sharks. i always knew there was something weird   about that dude. but you promised to love him no matter what.

MONICA:
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone.   not if he gets his jollys to jaws!

RACHEL:
 ah! you know what honey guys are just different,   they like things that we can't understand, you know i once dated this guy who   wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that   he unfroze from a block of ice.

MONICA:
: eww are you talking about my bother.

RACHEL:
 yeah i didn't disguise that very well did i.

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 listen to this... i went out with this girl last night   and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her.  

RACHEL:
 so basically you've slept with all the woman in   new york and now you're just going around again.

JOEY:
 well that's not even the weird part. i don't think   she remembered sleeping with me.

MONICA:
: but you don't remember sleeping with her.

JOEY:
 yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am   very memorable, you guys know.

RACHEL:
 what, how do we know, we never slept with you.

JOEY:
 and who's fault is that.

MONICA:
: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe   you were having an off night

JOEY:
 hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes   when i'm a little bloated i don't feel very sexy but even then i'm better then   most!

MONICA:
: honey why don't you just let it go and ask her   out again.

RACHEL:
 yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember   who you've slept with, you're made for each other.

JOEY:
 interesting. all right i'll go out with her again   and try to get past it 

MONICA:
: joey, joey.

JOEY:
 what?

MONICA:
: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?

JOEY:
 no.     

PHOEBE:
 it's open.

ROSS:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay!   

ROSS:
 yay!   quick thing, i went to talk to mike.

PHOEBE:
 what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross!

ROSS:
 oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there   to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended   up telling him that.

PHOEBE:
 what!

ROSS:
 umm. that you had a six year long relationship with   a guy named vicrum.

PHOEBE:
 what! why?

ROSS:
 well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in   a serious relationship.

PHOEBE:
    with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your   danglers right now!

ROSS:
 well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know   a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer    used to date oprah. 

PHOEBE:
 i'm not going along with some lie you made ross,   no i'm just gonna be honest with him.

ROSS:
 good yeah just be honest with him.

PHOEBE:
 yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't   been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a   real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will   and that's ok. so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be. it'll   be fine. it'll be fine. i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh   

ROSS:
 i'll get it

PHOEBE:
 ok

    of the last time i opened a door and you weren't there, phoebe are you ok?   

PHOEBE:
 uh huh yeah    there's something you should know   

 so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents,   a perfect couple getting divorced, i kinda took it the hardest cause i was   the youngest.

JOEY:
 uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me?

 what?

JOEY:
 how could you not remember that we slept together?

 what! when?

JOEY:
 i dunno!

 i really, really think i would remember sleeping with you

JOEY:
 come on, come on, search your brain all right. it   was    sex 

 no it's not ringing any bells.

JOEY:
 my god woman! how many people do you have to had been   with not to remember any of this?

 hey hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. joey!

JOEY:
 ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember   me hey! i still got it.   i'll let myself out.  

PHOEBE:
 .and i said vicrum you can't just call every time   you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel.

 but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross

PHOEBE:
 yeah well    might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee.

 that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.

PHOEBE:
 i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you   know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.

 i just think there's somebody better out there for   you, 

PHOEBE:
 oh.

 and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with   me. although i do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway i just   think i can make you happy.

PHOEBE:
 ok i can't do this.

 what's wrong?

PHOEBE:
 well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because   i never really have been in a long-term relationship, i've never lived with   a guy, and i've never even celebrated an anniversary so.    too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand. in fact i'll close   my eye's make it less awkward   you kissed me.

 uh huh

PHOEBE:
 so you don't think i'm a total freak

 no. well look can i think your weird and also cool   for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.

PHOEBE:
 i guess so, can i. can i think it's cool that you   kiss me and also wanna kiss you again   and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.

 definitely

ROSS:
   this is vicrum.   

CHANDLER:
 hi honey i'm home!

MONICA:
: hi, how was your flight? 

CHANDLER:
 oh it was great.

MONICA:
: here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable   because i.    a little surprise for you.

CHANDLER:
 well, well, well it must be five in tulsa because   it's six o clock in ny.c!

MONICA:
: ok    you. 

CHANDLER:
    a bunch of sharks swimming around.

MONICA:
: is this not the good part? do you want me to fast   forward to something a little toothier.

CHANDLER:
 no i'm not quite sure you got the right movie   that's all.

MONICA:
: oh well this is the only one they had at our video   store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. or does it always   have to be sharks?

CHANDLER:
 does what always have to be sharks.

MONICA:
: honey look we can do something else, do you want   me to get into the tub and thrash.

CHANDLER:
 what's going on?

MONICA:
: sweetie it's ok, i still love you, let me be a   part of this.

CHANDLER:
 let me be a part of this!

MONICA:
: i saw what you were doing in tulsa. angry sharks   turn you on!

CHANDLER:
 no they don't

MONICA:
: then why were you watching them and giving yourself   a treat.

CHANDLER:
 oh my god! when you came in i switched the channel,   i was just watching regular porn

MONICA:
: really?

CHANDLER:
 yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american   action.

MONICA:
: i cannot tell you how happy that makes me!  

CHANDLER:
 you are an amazing wife.    you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, i mean where do you   find the strength and understanding over something like that.

MONICA:
: im very, very drunk right now.     

JOEY:
    to her, but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her? did i not sleep with   her?

 you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your     whole dating attitude. your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious     relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you     go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience     never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.

PHOEBE:
 oh hey you guys, i couldnt get a reservation for the night of  my birthday, so we have to do dinner thursday night instead.

JOEY:
 thursday? but thats halloween.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 so, so, is mike coming to dinner?

PHOEBE:
 no! its my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to  work. uch, i get mad at him, but i think its a little to soon to show my true  colors.

RACHEL:
 pheebs, i would make a reservation for five, because one of us  has to stay home and watch emma.  dinner?

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

RACHEL:

MONICA:
 oh, dear god! opening credits  

CHANDLER:
 good morning everyone, its nice to see our team together  for the first time. now, before we get started, are there any questions?  

 thats right. is it true, that the reason you are here in tulsa  is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you  were saying yes to?

CHANDLER:
   but yeah, thats true. alright, lets get started, by  take a look at last quarters figures.   ah, claudia, arent you supposed to blow smoke up the  bosses ass?

 im sorry. does the smoke bother you?

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no-no-no. i smoked for years, then i quit. right  now, i cant remember why.  office. not right?

 yes, in oklahoma its legal to smoke in offices with fifteen  people or less. 

CHANDLER:
 alright, lolook. i dont smoke anymore. but if the rest of  you want to light up, go ahead, its fine.  then? thats almost rude, that im not.

 thats not true. if you dont wanna smoke 

CHANDLER:
  my wife would kill me.

 im sorry, but isnt your wife back in new york?

CHANDLER:
 i always liked you, ken.      

PHOEBE:
  

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, and treat it is. 

MONICA:

MONICA:
 this is not, what im wearing. im ovulating and chandlers  gonna be home any minute, so i thought we would try before dinner.

PHOEBE:
 ohh. oh wait!  you?

MONICA:
 believe me, chandler and i have not seen each other in over a  week. well probably be the first ones there.

PHOEBE:
 kay, see you there. happy humping!   heyhey! oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? oh my god, dont people  know, youre not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 no! i just happened tdo a lot trivias about smoking in  different states. for example, in hawaii cigarettes are called  leyhallalookoos.

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

ROSS:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 rach you did not leave the water running. please, just pull  yourself together, okay?

RACHEL:
 ah, did i leave the stove on?

ROSS:
 you never cooked since 1996.  

RACHEL:
 is the window open? because if theres a window open, a bird  could fly in there.

ROSS:
 oh my god, you know what, yeah, i think youre right. i think   listen, listen!

RACHEL:
 ubb.

ROSS:
 a pigeon, a pigeon.  wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. landed on the stove and caught fire. the baby,  seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birds aid. the eagle,  however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon.  meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. baby and bird still up lays   apartment.

RACHEL:
 boy, are you gonna be sorry if thats true. 

 hello.

 hey.

 its been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a  smaller table.

JOEY:
 maybe we should just eat now.

 you cant order until your entire party has arrived.  restaurant policy.

JOEY:
 wha-a how about this: another table leaves, right? but theres  still some food left on their place, okay, whats the restaurants policy about  people eatin that?

 estrangement 

JOEY:
 but it happens?  bathroom.

PHOEBE:
 no, you cant go. no-no-no, i cant hold this table on my own.  if they ask me to move, i cave.

JOEY:
 if you ask me to stay, ill pee. 

 good evening, miss.  

PHOEBE:
 okay, fine, ill move. alright, you dont have to manhandle  me. 

JOEY:
   finally you guys made it.  pheebs, who the helluhuhh!      monica in bed 

MONICA:
 spend more time with the tie. thatll make a baby.

CHANDLER:
 look, i cant do this. i cant make luv to you while were  fighting this way.

MONICA:
 oh sure, now youre mister sensitivity. but when you wanted to  have sex right after my uncles funeral

CHANDLER:
 that was a celebration of life. alright, look, im not gonna  do this. alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?

MONICA:
 no, youre right. mnya, we shouldnt do it like this. huch.  for what its worth, im, im sorry. i shouldnt have come down on you so hard  about the smoking. so you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.

CHANDLER:
 mean it?

MONICA:
 yah.

CHANDLER:
 you are incredible. unless, iim not gonna smoke again. and  if i do, i promise, i will hide it so much better from you. 

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 yeah, lets celebrate life!

MONICA:
 kay. 

RACHEL:
 och, god.  sorry we left you. mom never gonna leave you again. never ever ever again.  uch.

ROSS:
 great. so lets get going?

RACHEL:
 oh no. i mean it. after what just happened, im never leaving  her again.

 i understand, separation is hard. one time i was about to  leave ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his 

 mommy, im a girl, take  me with you.

ROSS:
 somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you. 

CHANDLER:
 uhh. you are welcome.

MONICA:
 you know what? lets not talk.

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 uch. i am still so mad at you for smoking.

CHANDLER:
 but you said you forgave me. it was just a couple of  cigarettesno big deal.

MONICA:
 oh, blablablabaybaybay.

CHANDLER:
 leave it.

MONICA:
 i was just saying that because i was ovulating and you said  you wouldnt have sex with me while were fighting.

CHANDLER:
 you tricked me to get me into bed?

MONICA:
 thats right, i got mine.

CHANDLER:
 i feel so used. 

PHOEBE:
 well, i guess theyre not coming. you wanna just order?

JOEY:
 thank you. 

 risotto with the shaped truffles and  the roasted rip steak with the golden chanterelles and a bordelaise sauce and  that any that stuff i just said means snails. 

 erdoes not.

PHOEBE:
 tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?

 oh, theyre both exclus

PHOEBE:
 both it is, thank you.

JOEY:
 oh, uh, again. can i make a special request: can you bring  everything as soon as its ready? appetizers, entrees, we dont care.

 

 ill just wait to put your order in.

PHOEBE:
 you guys are over an hour late. what happened to you two?

ROSS:
 im so sorry 

RACHEL:
 we got locked out of the apartment, we 

JOEY:
 thats a great storycan i eat it?

ROSS:
 and then rachel wasnt sure she could leave the baby.

RACHEL:
 n-it wasnt easy, but its your birthday and i did what i got  to do.

PHOEBE:
 and thats judy over there at the bar with emma?

RACHEL:
 oh honey, this is for the best, thus im not distracted,  worrying about emma, how shes doing at home and im being completely here with  you and, oh, she spit up!

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 she spit up. judy! she spijudy! look alive, judy!   thank you.

ROSS:
 thanks. oh.

RACHEL:
 oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. what should i ha-ave?  what should i have?

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 yknow this ??? is incredible.

JOEY:
 ross bruises like a peach. he bruises like a peach.

ROSS:
 okay, ill have the fixed salad and the duck.

RACHEL:
 yah, ill have the soup and the salmon.

JOEY:
 and remember whatever comes up first. okay? and hurry, because  

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 son of a bitch!

PHOEBE:
 wher-where have you been?

MONICA:
 well, we had a little fight.

CHANDLER:
 i would never lie to get someone into bed.

MONICA:
 you used to tell girls you were a kennedy.  ooh, uh, thanks. wow, little tight, isnt it? how dyou get a bigger table?  you-you had a big table, but they made you move. huh-huh, shut up monica. whoo,  i suppose that chandler will have the smoked duck.

CHANDLER:
 i suppose that monica will have the  manipulative  shrew.

 ill give you another minute.

JOEY:
 why are you going? he said, she wanted the shrew!  

ROSS:
 rach, cmon, emma is fine. youre turning into an obsessive  mother. okay, you need to stop.

RACHEL:
 yguys ever heard the story about when rosses mom went to the  beauty salon?

CHANDLER:
 you mean the lully story?

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
 you guys, weve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe  you should order.

JOEY:
  they want.

MONICA:
 why would you do that?

JOEY:
 chandler, control your woman!

RACHEL:
  like to start the celebration and make a toast  to phoebe. she dropped her  sock.

PHOEBE:
 aw  what?

RACHEL:
 n-no, emma dropped her sock.

MONICA:
 moms here? i wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me  she was out of town.

RACHEL:
 ross, she still has not noticed that the babys sock is on the  ground.

PHOEBE:
 s a good toast.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 w-oa  mommy! 

PHOEBE:
  up the sock! pick up the sock!  di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt  evening? look, i know, you all have a lot going on, but all i wanted to do was  have dinner with my friends on my birthday. and you are all so late and you  didnt even have the courtesy to call.  now.

ROSS:
 well, ??? think thats us?

PHOEBE:
 well, this is, this is, this is not over!  hello?

JOEY:
  two?

MONICA:
 uch, you see, im ovulating.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, thats what she says. but maybe youre not  ovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed.

MONICA:
 yes smokie, that is what it was. i just cant get enough.

CHANDLER:
  me into having sex with her.

JOEY:
 so? did have sex, right?

CHANDLER:
 whats the matter with me? why im such a girl?

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 phoebe, hi, were so sorry. youre totally right. we are here  one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday  celebration.

PHOEBE:
 mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. huh, nkay, im gonna  take off.

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i love you guys too, but mike got off work early. wait.  wait, im not tnot that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with  her boyfriend. you know what? i am. bye guys! 

RACHEL:
 oh thank god, if phoebes going, can we please take emma  home?

ROSS:
 you know, i think thats a good ideaour babysitter just pounded  in another chardonnet. 

MONICA:
 bye.

JOEY:
 see ya. well, this is just us.

 mhum.

MONICA:
 so, im, im probably still ovulating. do you want to give it  another try?

CHANDLER:
 so you never had sex with a kennedy, have you?

JOEY:
 do, do you gonna do it now?

MONICA:
 we dont have much time. once the egg descended the oviduct  

JOEY:
 no-ohoh. 

 i sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.

JOEY:
 nah, just me. all alone.  for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special. closing credits 

 how was everything, sir?

JOEY:
 excellent. the shrew in particular was exclusive.

 well, i hope, you got some room left.

  birthday to you, happy birthday dear 

JOEY:
 joey! joey.

  joey, happy birthday to you.

CHANDLER:
   hello?   hello?

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 honey, you're screaming.

MONICA:
 you bet your ass i am! i just had the best first day 

 twice as big as allessandro's.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 yeah, a-a-and clean. not just health department clean...    monica clean.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 oh, and the people are so nice. there's this one guy,    geoffrey, he's the maitre d., chandler, you will love him. he is without a doubt,    the funniest guy i have ever met.   opening credits  

 this is nice.

PHOEBE:
 i know!    shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want  

 you need both hands for that?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i kinda do.    how's this?    the sugar and puts it in her coffee. mike thinks it over and nods appreciative.    after that, they hold hands again. joey now enters, and sees the two sitting  

JOEY:
    at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?   have you not talked about it yet?      if you were bigger you'd hit me,    huh...? aaaaaahhhhhh 

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry... i'm sorry. it's obviously way too early    for us to be... having that conversation.

 is it?

PHOEBE:
 

 okay, when i got divorced, i didn't think i'd feel this    way about someone for a really long time... then again, i didn't think i'd meet    someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... i want you to have    this...    phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. he finally has found   no, not... that's gum.    i love it when that happens, you know... think no note's there...

PHOEBE:
 

 oh, sorry.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, it's a key. to be honest, i think i'd prefer the    five dollars.

 it's to my apartment.

PHOEBE:
    phoebe and mike.

 yeah, look, and i don't want you to feel like you have    to give me your key just because...

PHOEBE:
 oh no, i want to.

 oh, thank god.  

PHOEBE:
 yeah... ooh... wow... even started to think i'd never    meet someone that, you know, i wanted to... do this with. here you go.  

 is this cool, huh?

PHOEBE:
 it really is.

JOEY:
    is amazing these little things open doors... huh!    

RACHEL:
 so i don't go back to work for another four weeks,    but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that emma could get a chance    to know her.

    really smart. the easier we can make the transition for her, the better.  

RACHEL:
 that's great, great. so do you have any questions    for us?

 not really.

RACHEL:
 allright. well thank you so much for coming...  

ROSS:
 thank you.

RACHEL:
 really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.

 oh, you know, wait. i do have    one question.    testing?

ROSS:
 boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.

 that's cool. but... but if you do, i'm    gonna need three days notice.

RACHEL:
 okidoki!   wow! we're never gonna find a nanny.

ROSS:
 oh, come on rach, we will. i promise. we have more interviews       the uhm... the first one we met with.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 she was blonde?    then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... there's knocking at   just a sec.! okay, okay. this one's name is sandy. she's got a degree    in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three    years.

RACHEL:
 okay... 

 

ROSS:
 and she's a little mannish... 

PHOEBE:
 

 hi! i-i-is this a bad time?

PHOEBE:
    hi... oh my gosh! what are you doing here? are you back from minsk?

 well, just for a couple of days, uhm... i'm here to    explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that    we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.

PHOEBE:
 who cares, it got you here.

 well, it got me to new york anyway, and then i got    on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and i just... gave him your    address i... i... i didn't even think about it.

PHOEBE:
 wow. where is your luggage? 

 damn it!

PHOEBE:
 a-allright, well... i'll call the cab company.

 wa... wa... wait! we can... call them later. can you    just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? boy! there's an old russian expression, 

 schto ya ztez vigul... ui! roughly translated that 

 wow!

PHOEBE:
 thank you! god, no! you should see me when... oh actually,    no, i look pretty good.

 are... are you kidding? you know, when you don't see    someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and 

 come on, don't be crazy. nobody is that beautiful,    but... well, you are.    anyone? 

PHOEBE:
 no...  

PHOEBE:
 i'm... i'm just... i'm the worst person ever. how    can i not tell david that i'm seeing mike?

MONICA:
 maybe he didn't give you a chance.

PHOEBE:
 he said: are you seeing someone? and i said no...

MONICA:
 oh, well... that had been your window.

PHOEBE:
 yeah! i mean, i don't know. i was just , i was looking, 

 oh my god! it's david. david's    here. he's just, he's so irresistible.

MONICA:
 really? the scientist guy?

PHOEBE:
 really? chandler?

MONICA:
 continue...

PHOEBE:
 oh.okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then i told him    that i would see him tomorrow night.

MONICA:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 i know!    i like mike so much, you know. it's just going really well. oh my god!

MONICA:
 wow, isn't it ironic that david would show up on the    same day that you and mike exchange keys?

PHOEBE:
    my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am.

MONICA:
 what are you gonna do?

PHOEBE:
 i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that    nothing can happen between us. unless i don't... you know, complicated    moral situation, no right, no wrong...

MONICA:
 you have to tell david!

PHOEBE:
 okay, i knew i should have had this conversation    with joey. 

CHANDLER:
    i'm funny, right...? what do you know, you're a door... you just like knock-knock    jokes...    inside! 

MONICA:
 heeeeeey! 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they    call it the sooner state. frankly i'd sooner be in any other state.   and what's with oklahoma    having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, i'm from    the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch.

MONICA:
    pressurised?

CHANDLER:
    me started on the way that people from tulsa talk.

PHOEBE:
 okay. 

CHANDLER:
 what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two    words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so,    i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried    chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken?   see, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?

MONICA:
 no, it just remind me of something this guy did today    at work. i told you about that funny guy, geoffrey, right?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, he came up...

MONICA:
 well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there,    but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.  

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny... 

 i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave    your child with another person. i mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your    heart... 

RACHEL:
 sandy, that's exactly what it is...

ROSS:
 are you gay?  

RACHEL:
 ross!

 it's okay. i get that a lot doing what i do. but i    am straight. i-i'm engaged actually.

RACHEL:
 oh!

 her name is deliah.

RACHEL:
 oh, that's pretty.

ROSS:
 

 i realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people,    but i really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is    take care of a child.

ROSS:
 

 like in my last job, i met daniel when he was three    weeks old. and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person... 

 i'll see you soon... and he said to me: skdandy...   that was his name for me... i'll see you every day...    right in...    sentence. rachel tries to comfort him, but ross has this "you've got to  

ROSS:
 yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.  

RACHEL:
 oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.

 oh, oh, i can do it for her, if you want...

RACHEL:
 oh, that would be great!   i love him, i love him, i love him...

ROSS:
 oh, come on, rach, he's a guy!

RACHEL:
 so wh..? he's smart, he's qualified. give me one good    reason we shouldn't try him out.

ROSS:
 because, it's weird!

RACHEL:
 why?

ROSS:
 what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i-it's    like if a woman wanted to be...

RACHEL:
   yes?

ROSS:
 king?

 i er... i hope you don't mind. i used some of my home-made    lotion on emma. it's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. it'll dry that    rash right up. plus... it keeps the hands young... 

RACHEL:
   yes! sandy you're hired.

 that's great!   i'm    sorry. it's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new    family...

RACHEL:
 oooh... ***i really can't hear what she says*** come here.

ROSS:
 you gotta be at least bi... commercial break  

CHANDLER:
 hey!    minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. chandler waits   i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica    is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks.

JOEY:
 ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering    lines.

CHANDLER:
    livelihood doesn't depend on it.

JOEY:
 i know, right?    wh... wh... why are we doing this?

CHANDLER:
 monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy    she's ever met.

JOEY:
 seriously? she actually said that?

CHANDLER:
 yes! am i crazy to be this upset?

JOEY:
 nooooo! being funny is your thing!

CHANDLER:
 yeah!

JOEY:
 without that, you just got "lame with women".

CHANDLER:
 ye....  

MONICA:
 hi! there you are.

JOEY:
    size and he turns to monica who doesn't understand what's happening. then he    

 wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.

PHOEBE:
 oof...

 in fact, ehm... i going to kiss you now.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, wait, wait!

 yeah, i-i don't, i can't get away with stuff like that.    i-i-it sounded sexy in my head, so i...

PHOEBE:
 no, no, it's not that.    uhm... remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well,    uhm... i am. his ... his name is mike.

 oh... oh...

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i should have told you.

 no... well, yeah.

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, i'm sorry.

 well, i-it's okay. i-i-i understand... well, s... well,    are you happy with this guy?

PHOEBE:
 i am happy.

 damn it! i-i'm sorry. i-i don't mean that. i-i want    you to be happy... but only with me. no, uhm... that's not fair. uh, who cares,    leave him!. oh, i don't mean that. yes i do... i'm sorry uhm, i... i think i    should probably uhm... go...

PHOEBE:
 well... but david, just... i just want you to know    that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things    i've ever had to do.

 well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly    a vladnik carnival either... can we at least hug goodbye?

PHOEBE:
 of course, yeah.  you know, a kiss    on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...

 no... no...

PHOEBE:
 i mean...  

 in minsk...

PHOEBE:
 yeah?

 ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm...    and one on the lips.

PHOEBE:
 well, if that's what they do in minsk...   in new york...    it's...      holds emma. ross enters the apartment. sandy and rachel wipe their tears away  

RACHEL:
   hi...

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. sandy was just... was    just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just    sooo beautiful.

 well, her favourite flower is the camellia. from the    poem...

RACHEL:
 i can't... i can't hear it again.

 you know, i can't tell it again...  

ROSS:
 and i'm fine never having heard it...   rach, can i... can i see    you for a sec?

RACHEL:
 yeah!  

ROSS:
 do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three    times...? huh? i haven't cried that many times since i moved in.

RACHEL:
 look, ross, he's just... sandy is just sensitive,    that's all.

ROSS:
    is the problem. he is too sensitive. 

RACHEL:
 what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby?

ROSS:
    that guy... 

RACHEL:
 sandy made madeleines.

ROSS:
 this... this is exactly what i'm talking about. what    kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they're not even...    butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.  

RACHEL:
 well, i... you know, i-i-i don't know what to say...    i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.    you know, 'cause i gotta tell you ross, it not like you just came in    from branding cattle.

ROSS:
 hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.

RACHEL:
 okay, what? what is too sensitive?    music coming from the living room. ross opens the door to the living room and    he and rachel see sandy play a song for emma on his recorder. rachel is moved    by this, but ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the    

PHOEBE:
 hmmm... no, no... no, i can't do this. it's bad.

 but... i-i-it's nice... a-a-and... nice is good. a-a-and    good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.

PHOEBE:
 no, no. no.

 but... ergo...

PHOEBE:
 look david, if... if you had never left, then... yeah,    we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and i-i'm with    mike and i really care about him...

 uhm... uhm... goodbye... uh... schto ya ztez vigul...    ui...  

 well... hey, the key works...!  

PHOEBE:
    face massage. thank you.  

ROSS:
 did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?

MONICA:
 yeah! i think that's great!

ROSS:
 oh really? did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites    poetry and bakes madeleines?

MONICA:
 oh... how are they?

ROSS:
   but that's not the point. 

JOEY:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey...! rachel and i hired a male nanny.

JOEY:
    weird...

ROSS:
 thank you!

JOEY:
 that's like a woman wanting to be a...

ROSS:
 ...a what? a what? what's the end of that sentence?

MONICA:
 yes... what is the end of that sentence?

JOEY:
 uhm... a penis model.   anyway, hey... did you tell chandler    that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?

MONICA:
 yeah, so?

ROSS:
 wow!

JOEY:
 really? do you not know chandler?

MONICA:
 is that why he's acting so weird...? he's jealous...?    oh my god, that is crazy. it's not like i'm attracted to geoffrey...

JOEY:
 so what? being funny is chandler's thing...    you know, like ross's thing is... 

ROSS:
 science...? academia...? being a good father...?

JOEY:
 ...no... 

MONICA:
 i can't believe he's that upset about this...

JOEY:
 monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay.    'cause he's feeling like... 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

JOEY:
 heeeyy! hey!

CHANDLER:
 what are you guys talking about?

ROSS:
 uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny.  

CHANDLER:
 you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...?       laugh and punches ross. now all three of them laugh, but very fake. chandler  

CHANDLER:
 you know, i don't mind a... male nanny, but i do    draw the line at a male wetnurse. 

MONICA:
 ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!

CHANDLER:
 if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would    have brought more pizza. 

MONICA:
 okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it!  

CHANDLER:
 what is so funny about that?  

MONICA:
 well, i don't know... i-it's... just the way you say    it... i mean, you're funny... you have that funny thing. you're a funny guy!    

CHANDLER:
 did you tell her what we talked about?  

JOEY:
 yeah....

CHANDLER:
 so those were pity laughs? pity laughs?  

MONICA:
 honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with    geoffrey.

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah? is he funnier than me?

MONICA:
 well, you're... you're different funny... i mean,    you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions...    and... and limericks...

CHANDLER:
 i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named    chandler, whose wife made him die inside.

MONICA:
 honey, you know i think you're hilarious! come on,    you know that joke you told me last week? the one about jerry lewis and the    girl with the lazy eye...? 

ROSS:
 hey... i made up that joke and told it to you!  

JOEY:
 not knowing when to shut up...

ROSS:
 yep! that's my thing... commercial break 

 so... how many guys have your key?

PHOEBE:
 no, no, no, no, no... it's not... it's not... i'ts    not as bad as it looks... really. i was just saying goodbye to an old friend.

 oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

 ...kiss him?

PHOEBE:
 oh, well, yeah...

 yes, but uhm... you should know... she really likes    you. i-in fact i-i-i don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.

 why? wh-what are you going to do about it?

 well... i'll... just show you what i'm gonna do about    it...  

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:

PHOEBE:
 right! never! never! i swear!  

 i-i... oh i...i just wanna say uhm... if you do ever    come to minsk, that's my number    party up vladnik style.     own door. now he hears two recorders playing a song. when he enters, sandy and  

JOEY:
 yeah! allright! hey, hey ross. check it out! sandy taught    me hot-cross buns.

ROSS:
 really? sounded like three blind mice.

JOEY:
 noooo... three blind mice goes like this...  

ROSS:
    god...! 

 who's up for puppets?

JOEY:
 me! i'm up for puppets!

 well, please welcome... the snufflebumps... who wants    to be mr. wigglemunch and who's gonna be the grumpus?

ROSS:
 okay, okay... how exactly is a two month old supposed    to appreciate puppets?

 actually studies have shown that the movement and colours    help their cerebral development... the whimsical characters are just for us.     

JOEY:
 i wanna be mr. wigglemunch.  

ROSS:
 

 well, i guess we know who's gonna be the grumpus...      

RACHEL:
 that was kind of rude!

ROSS:
 oh, i'm sorry. please apologise to sandy and the snufflebumps    for me.

RACHEL:
 you know, he was just doing his job...

ROSS:
 well, you know what... i-i'm sorry i'm the only one    who isn't in love with gary poppins out there... but i just... i can't... i    can't go through with this.

RACHEL:
 oh, come on ross...

ROSS:
 no! hey, you know what? i'm sorry. i would never force    you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 thank you!

RACHEL:
 well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're    gonna have to do it.  

    why it's important to shaaaaaaare...

JOEY:
   

CHANDLER:
 well, i'm off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend    has any funny oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.

MONICA:
 honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey    told this really sexist joke. after that, not so funny anymore.

CHANDLER:
 really...? see... that's the thing: you gotta keep    it smart, people!

MONICA:
 okay, don't miss that flight. you know i love you.

CHANDLER:
 i love you too.   and... i like you as a friend.   

JOEY:
 allright. see you later!

CHANDLER:
 see ya! 

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 naaaa... he still kills me. last night he had me laughing    so hard, i swear... a little pee came out.  

ROSS:
 here goes...

RACHEL:
 i can't watch. it's like firing elmo.  

ROSS:
 sandy... hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. i'm afraid    it's not working out.

 

ROSS:
 yeah, uhm... i mean, rachel and i, think you are great...    with emma... uhm... we just feel...

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right.    i'm sorry. we're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...

 oh, no, no, no... that's okay. i got a lot of offers    from other families. i just picked you guys because... i liked you the best.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 anyway, uhm...well, i'm glad there's no hard feelings.

 no, none at all. you need to be happy with whoever    is in your home... although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem?    maybe it's something i can work on in the future.

ROSS:
 no, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's    uhm... my issue.

 what is it...?  

ROSS:
 you know, i'm just not uhm... that comfortable with    a guy who's as sensitive as you.

 that's fair... although, can i ask... why do you think    that is?

ROSS:
 why... i... i don't know.    uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?

 hmmm... 

ROSS:
 i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was    kind of a tough guy... you know a-a-and as a kid i wasn't the athlete i am now.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 i play squash...! anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get    the feeling he thought i was too sensitive.

 that must have been hard.

ROSS:
 it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom...    playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father    walks in and says... he says... "what are you doing with those things?    what's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like    a... like a real boy?

 but you are a real boy!

ROSS:
 i know i am!    summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?

 it's allright! crying is good. it lets the boo-hoos    out. 

ROSS:
 here come some more... commercial break  

 and what's the one kind of boat that can never,    ever sink?

 what kind?

 a friend-ship...

JOEY:
 wow! you blow my mind...

 oh, i gotta go.

JOEY:
 aaahh... how much do i owe you?

 twenty bucks.

ROSS:
 and that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really    were on a break.    here gorgeous.    are the cutest little baby ever! you're just a... a little bitty baby, you know    that? but you've got...    yes you do... and a... and a big round belly.    butt! i like big butts.    brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and    a round thing in your face you get...   laughing! oh my god, you've never done that before, have you? you never done    that before... daddy made you laugh, huh? well, daddy and sir mix alot... what?    what? you... you wanna hear some more? uhm...   none / unless you got buns hon...    i'm a terrible father! opening credits 

CHANDLER:
 hi!

JOEY:
 hey... hey listen... what do you guys know about investments?

CHANDLER:
 how come?

JOEY:
 well, i'm starting to make good money on the show and    i'm thinking... i should probably do something with it.

MONICA:
 what do you do with your money now?

JOEY:
 well, i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.       a bank guarded by robots!

CHANDLER:
 do you have any ideas?

JOEY:
 uh, yeah... this guy at work got me excited about going    in on an emu farm. that'd be kinda cool huh? pitchin' in on the weekends, helping    to plant the emus...

MONICA:
 joe... emus are birds. you raise them for meat.

JOEY:
    birds... bird meat... now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you 

 "excuse me, i'll have a bucket of fried    bird." 

MONICA:
 joey, i think you should consider something a little    less risky. i mean, i think in this market, real estate is your best investment.the    fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.    

JOEY:
 real estate, huh? hmmm...

MONICA:
    apartment? richard!

CHANDLER:
    of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? monica!

MONICA:
 my dad told me. they play golf together.

CHANDLER:
 oh, well... maybe i'll join them some time. i just    hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.  

PHOEBE:
 hi!

 hey!

PHOEBE:
 listen! you have to help me pick a dress 'cause i'm    meeting mike's parents tonight! 

MONICA:
 wow, the boyfriend's parents! that's a big step.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 they live on the upper east side on park avenue!

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, she can't be herself.

PHOEBE:
 okay, so... allright... which dress?    two 'phoebe' dresses, rachel and monica look at them... taking their time, don't   you can say "neither".

 oh god, neither!

MONICA:
 i'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping.    it's gonna be fine.

RACHEL:
 yeah, totally! you are in such good hands. and i'm    so good with meeting parents. with the father, you know, you want to flirt a 

 "oh mr. pincer,    i can see where wallis gets his good looks..."

MONICA:
 you went out with wallis pincer?

RACHEL:
 uh, he took the sat's for me.

MONICA:
 i knew you didn't get a 1400!

RACHEL:
 ssshyeah, well, duh! i mean...

PHOEBE:
 so... now... what about with mike's mom?

RACHEL:
 oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell    her how amazing her son is. take it from me, moms love me. ross's mom one time    actually said i'm like the daughter that she never had.

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
    the daughter she never had.   

RACHEL:
 hi.

ROSS:
 hi.

RACHEL:
 i just finished getting phoebe all dressed to meet    mike's parents. she's so nervous, it's so sweet!

ROSS:
 guess what? i made emma laugh today.

RACHEL:
    i was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?

ROSS:
 yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person    laugh too. it was... it was like uhm...    but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. he laughs about himself but      only... only not creepy.

RACHEL:
 well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? 

ROSS:
 i uhm... well, i sang...    i rapped... baby got back... 

RACHEL:
 you what? you sang... to our baby daughter... a song    about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?

ROSS:
 but you know what, if you think about it, it actually    promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm...    juicy doubles.

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 please don't take her away from me!  

 oh hi, come on in. i'm catherine, the listing agent.

JOEY:
 hi i'm joey. this is chandler.

CHANDLER:
 so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt?    medical malpractice? choked on his own moustache?

 actually, he is buying a much bigger place. it's    got a great view of central pa.....

CHANDLER:
 mmm that's enough about you!

JOEY:
 is there anything we should know about the apartment?

 all the appliances are included. there is a lot    of light, a new kitchen... i think you guys would be very happy here...  

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we're not together.    we're not a couple. we're definately not a couple.

 oh... okay, sorry!

JOEY:
 well, you seem pretty insulted by that. what? i'm not    good enough for you? 

CHANDLER:
 we're not gonna have this conversation again...    look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this    huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about    losing monica to a real man!  

JOEY:
 you know what it is? it's a nice place but i gotta see    i don't know if i see myself living here. oh, oh, oh, let me see...   yeah,    i could see it.

CHANDLER:
   look at these videos. you know, i mean,    who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my    god!

JOEY:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 there's a tape here with monica's name on it.

JOEY:
 ooh! a tape with a girls name on it. it's probably a    sex tape...    this is richard's apartment... 

CHANDLER:
 get there faster!     all dressed up like an older woman, and very un-phoebe. she walks to the door  

 wow! you look like... like my mom.

PHOEBE:
 i'm wearing pantyhose!

 great! come on in!  

PHOEBE:
 oh, thank you! oh... oh my god, you're rich!

 no, my parents are rich.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, so... they gotta die someday.   hello!

 mom, dad, this is phoebe. phoebe, these are my parents:    theodore and bitsy.

PHOEBE:
    a delight!

 it's so nice to finally meet you!

PHOEBE:
 and you... your home is lovely.

 well thank you, i'll give you a tour later. it's actually    three floors.

PHOEBE:
 holy crap!

 phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet    our friends?

PHOEBE:
 oh, try and stop me!

 hey... wh... what are you doing?

PHOEBE:
    me.

 yeah, i'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this...    i'm wanting them to get to know phoebe, not 

PHOEBE:
 

 well, come on...

 phoebe, these are our friends, tom and sue angle.

 phoebe, come sit. tell us a little bit about yourself...    so where are you from?

PHOEBE:
    i'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went    to prison, so... i just moved to the city where uhm... i actually lived in a    burned out buick lesabre for a while...    that was okay, until uhm... i got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit    in my mouth and... but i... i got over it and uhm... anyway, now i'm uhm...    a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money    but at least i don't pay taxes, huh...   so...    where does everyone summer? commercial break 

PHOEBE:
 god! god! this is not going well.

 no, no, no, you're doing fine, really... why don't you    go talk to my dad?

PHOEBE:
 okay, okay, okay, okay... still sure about me being    myself?

 absolutely! or maybe just a little less pimp spit.

PHOEBE:
 so theodore... i uhm... i can see where mike gets    his good looks from...

 oh... well...

PHOEBE:
 yeah... and that physique! you must work out all the    time...

 oh no, not all the time... i do the best i can...

PHOEBE:
 yeah i bet! look out!  

 oh! owwwww! 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, are you okay?

 i recently had surgery.

PHOEBE:
 i'm so sorry!

 no, i'll be fine... i just should check the stitches...

PHOEBE:
 i really, really am sorry.

 how could you know. why wouldn't you punch me in    the stomach? 

 uhm... did you just hit my dad?

PHOEBE:
 yes... i'm sorry, i've never met a boyfriends parents    before...

 but, i mean, you have met... humans before, right? look,    why don't you go talk to my mom?

PHOEBE:
 yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... she looks nice,    i can talk to her.

 yeah, you do that, and i go check my dad for signs of    internal bleeding. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah... oh bitsy, hi. uhm... listen i just wanted    to thank you again for having me here tonight.

 well, not at all...

PHOEBE:
 also uhm... i just want you to know what a wonderful    man your son is.

 thank you, i think so too.

PHOEBE:
 well, and you know, it really is a testament to how    he was raised. especially to you. because he's very respectful of women.

 is he really?

PHOEBE:
 are you kidding. he is so considerate of my feelings    and... you know i think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle    lover.

 e-e-excuse me?

PHOEBE:
    no, no, no, no, no. don't get me wrong. no, he's not in like a sissy way. no,    no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...

 that's... my boy. 

 awesome!  

CHANDLER:
 i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch    it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching?    know i'm gonna watch it.  

JOEY:
 hey dude, what's up?

CHANDLER:
 don't judge me, i'm only human!

JOEY:
 did you take that tape?

CHANDLER:
 i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and    you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... wouldn't you need    to know what was on it?

JOEY:
 i don't know. who'm i'm married to?

CHANDLER:
 some girl...!?

JOEY:
 she hot?

CHANDLER:
 yeah...!?

JOEY:
 how did she get me to settle down?

CHANDLER:
 allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's    probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly    be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head... 

JOEY:
 guess i don't know. my experience: if a girl says yes    to being taped... she doesn't say no to much else, i tell ya...

CHANDLER:
 then you're gonna have to watch it for me.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is...    please?

JOEY:
 all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only    yourself to blame...    in the vcr, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... it's clearly a  

CHANDLER:
 why am i hearing cheering?

JOEY:
 well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.

CHANDLER:
 football? just football?

JOEY:
 yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.

CHANDLER:
 it's football... it's just football... this is great!    this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to    get a beer...      what the...      what are you doing?

JOEY:
 you don't wanna see what i just saw!    monica comes home, and sees chandler flat on his back on the floor and joey  

MONICA:
 what are you guys doing?   oh my god, is that richard?    a split second for joey to realise, he pulls monica down by her jacket, and    she falls, face down next to chandler. chandler gets up a bit, and joey quickly    

RACHEL:
 okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please?    please laugh for mommy...    making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers...   not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty    rap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'cause mommy can rap...   my    name is mommy and i'm here to say / that all the babies are... oh, i can't    rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i    know that you're not gonna tell anybody...   i    like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... / when    a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...   yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh! oh!   i like big butts and    i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... oh emma you're laughing!    oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. oh you beautiful little    weirdo... 

ROSS:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 oh you missed it. she was laughing. oh it was amazing.    it was amazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...

ROSS:
 oh i know, isn't it? ooh... what'd you do to get her    to laugh?

RACHEL:
 oh! you know, i just... couple of things i tried ...    i just sang a little doo... itsy bitsy spider...

ROSS:
 you sang baby got back didn't you?

RACHEL:
 nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass...  

PHOEBE:
 ...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly    cat, sme-lly ca-t / i-t's not your fau-lt. and that's the end of the song...    i realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen    minutes.

 phoebe writes lots of great songs. wha... what was that    one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?

PHOEBE:
 oh, pervert parade?

 

PHOEBE:
 oh, ode to a pubic hair?

 stop! 

PHOEBE:
 oh god! is that veal?

 mom, i thought i told you... phoebe's a vegetarian.

 oh!

PHOEBE:
 oh no, no, no, no... that's okay, that's okay... i    mean, i'm... i am a vegetarian... except for veal... yeah no, veal i love...

 phoebe you don't have to eat...

PHOEBE:
 no, no, no, i actually it's any baby animals: kittens,    fish babies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat    running through it...    it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian      hmmm... yummy   hmmm...    an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. you  

 so...? what do you think?    

MONICA:
 so you stole that tape from richard's apartment?

CHANDLER:
 whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn    star!

MONICA:
 that tape was never meant to be seen by...    joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private.  

JOEY:
    any secrets anymore...    it yet, okay, i see you later. 

MONICA:
 why in the world would you take this tape and and    why would you watch it?

CHANDLER:
 because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature    man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd    be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and    moustaches.

MONICA:
 is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?

CHANDLER:
 this is about you and richard. he's clearly not    over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.

MONICA:
 isn't that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that    is? you shouldn't be jealous. you should feel bad for him.

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a    moustache!

MONICA:
 chandler, this is not our problem. we've got each    other. that's all that matters.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling    around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...

MONICA:
 cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole    life! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how    it ends.

MONICA:
 that's not me!

CHANDLER:
 what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride    'em cowgirl!

MONICA:
 that bastard taped over me!  

CHANDLER:
 is that a problem? 

MONICA:
 i-it's just so insulting! big spring for a new blank    tape, doctor!  

 i can't imagine what he sees in her.

 she actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife    of his. 

 hey, what's going on?

 we were just chit-chatting. how's your friend?

 a little better.

 by the way, do you know who's moving back into town?    tom and sue's daughter jen.

 you remember her michael, she's lovely and... well    behaved and... single.

 i'm not interested.

 oh, please darling, let's be honest. you can have all    the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...

 all right, stop! you know, all phoebe has done tonight    is trying to get you to like her. and maybe that hasn't been clear all the time,    but she did her best. and yeah... she's a little different than you are...

 michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!  

 so what? i mean if even i can get past that, it shouldn't    bother you. and you don't have to like her. you just have to accept    the fact that i do. i mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman i love...

 the woman you what?  

PHOEBE:
 yeah... the woman you what?

 the woman i love...    which is probably something i shouldn't say for the first time in front of my    parents... and tom and sue...who are by the way the most sinfully boring i've    ever met in my life...

PHOEBE:
 i love you too... 

 you do?

PHOEBE:
 yeah...! how great is this...? 

 wanna get out of here?

PHOEBE:
 okay.

 mom, dad, thanks for dinner.

PHOEBE:
 i had a great time. 

 thirteen bathrooms in this place... i threw up in    the coat closet... ta taaa... commercial break

MONICA:
 hey hon, could you help me get the plates down?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our   wedding china today?

MONICA:
 no, i think we should save our china for something   really special. like if the queen of england comes over.

CHANDLER:
 honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint. 

MONICA:
 what if something gets broken, they're so expensive. 

CHANDLER:
 what is the point of having them if we never use   them?

MONICA:
 ok, but if something gets broken, and then the queen   comes over..

CHANDLER:
 i will explain it to her.

MONICA:
 <laughs> oh yeah, like i'm going to let you   talk to the queen. 

JOEY:
 wow, the parade is really good this year. man those   horses can crap. 

 next up is a marching band from muskogee, ok.

CHANDLER:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime   soap days of our lives? 

JOEY:
 yeah! i totally forgot i'm supposed to be there. i   can't believe i forgot. i usually write stuff like this on my arm.  <chandler grabs joey's left arm and pushes the sleeve up> <joey looks>   oh! stupid long sleeves. 

CHANDLER:
 what are you going to do?

JOEY:
 i guess i'm going to have to come up with a really   good reason why i wasn't there. the producers are going to be so mad at me.

00   am sharp, that means you tribbiani." like.. like i was some kind of idiot. 

CHANDLER:
 well you proved them wrong.

RACHEL:

 oh my god!

RACHEL:

RACHEL:
 uh.... its emma.

ROSS:
 hey amy. 

RACHEL:
 oh amy, you remember ross.

 not really. but you are much cuter then that geeky guy   she used to date.

ROSS:
 that was me.

 no, he was this creepy guy from high school who had   this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade. 

   still me.

 no, i'm not talking about you. <to rachel> it   was your fat    friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?

 amy. i'm going to save   you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> all me.  monica and chandler's apartment. <joey is walking around looking worried. >

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 i'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,   i'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute   this isn't the china we picked out.. 

MONICA:
 i know, after you left the store, i chose different   ones.

CHANDLER:
 why?

MONICA:
 well no offense honey, but your taste is a little   feminine for me.

CHANDLER:
 oh suddenly, flowers are feminine? < phoebe comes in>

PHOEBE:
 hey, everybody. happy thanksgiving!

JOEY:
 hey happy thanksgiving.. pheebs! <motions her to   come over> 

PHOEBE:
 hey, what's going on joe? 

JOEY:
 i.. i.. i need a good lie.

PHOEBE:
 oh okay. how about the whole "man walking on   the moon" thing. you know? you. you could. you could see the strings people! 

JOEY:
 no, no, no i need a good lie to explain why i wasn't   at a work thing today.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, honey. you stink at lying. 

JOEY:
 i do not.

PHOEBE:
 oh really. okay. let me ask you something. yesterday   at the coffee house, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, my muffin   was gone-who took it?

JOEY:
 somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a   raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and i said "hey   don't eat that-that's phoebe's" and he said.. <pause> he said.. "joey   you stink at lying." what am i going to do? 

PHOEBE:
 don't worry, don't worry. we'll come up with a good   lie. i'll help you practice it.

JOEY:
 oh great, that'd be great. thank you. 

PHOEBE:
 sure, what.. what was the work thing? 

JOEY:
 uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls   up his sleeve on his right arm and shows phoebe, she looks>

PHOEBE:
 "pick up grandma at the airport"?

JOEY:
 oh.. man.. ross and rachel's apartment. 

 oh she's precious. do you ever worry she's going to   get your real nose? 

RACHEL:
 amy! <pause> yes i do.. i really do. <grabs   ross' hand for support> <amy's cell phone rings> 

 hello? yeah, um. hang on one sec. <to ross and rachel> can   i take this upstairs? 

ROSS:
 sure, we don't live there but...

 seriously? its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands   around motioning 'just these rooms'> <to ross> i thought you were   a doctor. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, no. ross has a phd.

 ew. <walks into rachel's room, i'm guessing>

RACHEL:
 god she is unbelievable.

ROSS:
 i know, i mean a phd is just as good as an md.

RACHEL:
 oh sure ross, yeah. if i have a heart attack in a   restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush. 

 stupid thanksgiving.

RACHEL:
 what? what happened? 

 my boyfriend canceled on me. i mean.. i i finally find   a real relationship. i mean, someone that i can spend this day with and then   his wife comes back into town. i swear, its almost not worth dating married   guys. 

ROSS:
 don't say that.

 oh. i was so looking forward to this. it was going to   be such a beautiful thanksgiving. we were going to have sushi. 

RACHEL:
 oh amy, don't cry amy.  um.. ross, could i talk   to you in private?

ROSS:
 sure, you want to go upstairs? <ross and rachel go in the kitchen>

RACHEL:
 um look i was thinking.. if its ok with monica i   would like to invite amy to thanksgiving.

ROSS:
 you know, i think thats a great idea. it'll be like   the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis.

RACHEL:
 look i know she's a little tough to take. she has   no where else to go, and she's my sister. alright, she's emma's aunt. and i   would like them to bond. 

ROSS:
 ok, fine, but i don't want them bonding to much. i   don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job. 

RACHEL:
 ross, you know what? she may need one..we're just   going to have to make our peace with that!  <rachel grabs ross' hand for support and starts to cry a little> monica and chandler's apartment

 hi.

 hi, hey.

RACHEL:
 hey you guys, this is my sister amy.  this is   chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon. 

 hi.

 oh my god. you're on days of our lives. 

 yeah.

 wow. they must put a lot of makeup on you. 

 hap.. hap.. happy thanksgiving. <joey turns away and chandler reassuringly pats him on the back>

 hi.

 hi. <they hug and kiss on check> 

 hey you.

 so. welcome. is this your first time you're   seeing emma? 

 yeah i.. i think so. <sticks her hand out   to shake hands with phoebe and says to her> it's nice to meet you emma. 

 phoe-be.

 oh. that's a funny noise.  <monica and amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret   closet>

JOEY:
 pheebs, i still need some help here

PHOEBE:
 oh right, ok um. ok so its not just the lie you tell.   but its the way you tell it. . for example if you look down at the ground when   you're talking, people know you're lying. 

JOEY:
 oh.. i don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..   i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor. 

 you are a terrific actor.  <joey realizes what she's doing>

 hey. hey where's the baby?

RACHEL:
 oh we just put her down for a nap.

 oh i was just thinking. you know what would be incredible?   if you guys died. 

 thank you   amy. 

 no, no, then i would get the baby. i mean you know it   would be just like a movie. like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her,   then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then   i'd get married. 

PHOEBE:
 thats a great movie. <she claps> <joey nods in agreement>

 now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything   cause you know you'd be dead. i was thinking about changing her name. i'm just   not really a big fan of emily.  

ROSS:
 emma. 

 emma, ross wants you. 

PHOEBE:
 phoe-be.

 why does she keep making that   noise? 

RACHEL:
 honey, i don't know how to tell you this, but um,   if something were to happen to ross or to myself <ross and rachel knock   on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby. 

 well who would?

ROSS:
 well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would   want monica and chandler. 

CHANDLER:
 i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma. 

MONICA:
 yeah oh my god, i'm so moved. 

 i don't believe this, hold on a second. you guys die   and i don't get your baby? 

RACHEL:
 see look amy, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler.   we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected   to the baby.

 connected? i mean.. to what? she's.. she's  a lump. 

CHANDLER:
 you know, guys i got to say. this means so much   to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica   and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know i've had my doubts   about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts   to cry>

 <points to chandler> this guy? seriously?  later in the day.

MONICA:
 okay! it's time for dinner. everyone we're using   our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.

 woah. woah... <nearly really drops the   plate and more seriously> woah. 

MONICA:
 okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will   not be well recieved. <pinches ross' arm> ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.

JOEY:
 hey! how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?   do you not trust me with a fancy plate? 

MONICA:
 no, honey, its. thats a special plate.  see   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. 

JOEY:
 i can't believe i won.

 its such a slap in the face. i'm your sister and you   would give your baby to these strangers over me.

RACHEL:
 monica is ross' sister. 

 no, ross' sister was really fat. 

MONICA:
 that was me. 

 no, she was this really dorky girl in high school that   used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog. 

RACHEL:
 hey. amy. you've got to stop doing that. <amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly,   you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate> 

 okay, listen i know you're having a little   bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. i   mean, i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this.  <monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat   off with a knife>

MONICA:
 now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets   face it you have fun. 

 okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate   lady dies, then do i get the baby?

CHANDLER:
 no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated   at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right? <ross and rachel pause and ponder this> 

RACHEL:
 well actually...

CHANDLER:
 actually what? 

ROSS:
 well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma   would go to my parents. 

CHANDLER:
 what?

 hurts, doesn't it?  <chandler gives a look that says "yeah!">

 uh.. who has to die for me to get her?  <everyone is looking around and at joey with looks of 'what?' on their   faces> commercial break.

CHANDLER:
 so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough   to raise emma? 

 no,  that that is not what we're saying.

JOEY:
 yeah he's lying. he looked down.  <joey looks to phoebe and she nods in agreement>

CHANDLER:
 well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent?   because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! 

RACHEL:
 honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think   you're going to be a wonderful parent. it's just.. you're more the fun parent. 

ROSS:
 yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like   monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. 

MONICA:
 thats not how you see me, is it? 

 no you're all about the fun. 

CHANDLER:
 look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do   you really think i'm not capable? 

ROSS:
 no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're   strongest when.. when you're together. 

CHANDLER:
 ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks   on table>  she'd have to give her up. 

ROSS:
 sure, monica would have to give her up. 

JOEY:
 i lie better then that, right?

CHANDLER:
 so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends   die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left   in my life gets taken away from me?

PHOEBE:
 there's your movie! <claps>  later on. monica opens her front door. chandler is sitting in the hallway. 

MONICA:
 hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner. 

CHANDLER:
 oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise   poorly? 

MONICA:
 ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about.   i mean its not like their so responsible. emma is a product of a bottle of   merlot and a five year old condom. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong   father figure and i never will be. 

MONICA:
 no you learn these things. you grow into it.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said   was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody   knows it. 

MONICA:
 i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because   i think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard   parts. 

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "go   to your room! you're grounded"? 

MONICA:
 can you hear me say "you're grounded"?

CHANDLER:
 you said that to me last week. 

MONICA:
 how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture.  back to monica and chandler's apartment. amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.

 the producer from days left a message   on my machine asking why i wasn't at the parade. they said everybody's pissed   off at me.. <whiny voice> and they all got to meet santa! 

PHOEBE:
 it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's   easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. you weren't at the   parade because you had a family emergency. 

JOEY:
 oh, i like that, yeah. wasn't at the parade because   i had a family emergency.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, what happened? 

 oh.. my sister's   raccoon.

PHOEBE:
 no! nothing with a raccoon. 

JOEY:
 arg... alright, i'll take care of it. <throws hands   out in the air> monica and chandler come through the front door.

MONICA:
 oh wait.. what are you doing? 

JOEY:
 setting the table. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy   china for dessert too. 

MONICA:
 oh how nice. maybe later we can all go blow our noses   on my wedding dress.  ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying   thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. he goes to chandler.

ROSS:
 hey dude, you okay? sorry about before.

CHANDLER:
 oh no thats okay, you're totally right. i don't   know anything about disciplining a child. but it did hurt my feelings and i   want you to know that when i die, you don't get joey.  ross walks away with a face of yeah ok.

 ucch.  <pauses> uchh <louder   this time> in case you hadn't noticed, i'm not talking to you. 

RACHEL:
 uchh! <much louder and longer then amy's>

 you know.. this.. this is classic rachel.

RACHEL:
 yeah.. yeah right.. remember in high school when   i died and didn't give you my baby?

 this might be my one chance to have a baby rachel. i   mean, you know that i have been so busy focusing on my carrer. 

RACHEL:
 what? what carrer? 

 um.. i'm a decorator. 

RACHEL:
 ok. you decorate dad's office and so now you're a   decorator. okay! i went to the zoo yesterday and now i'm a koala bear. 

 why can't you ever be supportive? 

RACHEL:
 sup.. you want to talk supportive? you didn't even   come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby. 

 oh. yeah. well.. you didn't come see me when i was in   the hospital when i was getting my lips done. 

RACHEL:
 i did the first time! oh. oh.. <gets up and walks   into the kitchen> and you know what. you want to know why i'm not giving   emily to you.

ROSS:
 emma. 

 oh whose side are you on? <back   to amy> i'm not giving you emma because there is no way you could handle   the responibility of a child. 

 how hard could it be? you do it. 

JOEY:
 ooh oooh.. 

 do you want to know why you don't want  me to have   the baby? 

RACHEL:
 uh huh.

 because you don't want me to be happy. you.. you have   always been jealous of me. 

RACHEL:
 jealous of what? of your lack of responsiblity? you,   your immaturity? your total disregard of other people's feelings? 

 uh.. to name a few.  you know.. you know.. you've   just always been like this. you just have to have everything. and i couldn't   have anything. like in junior high, when you stole timmy from me. i mean, do   you even realize how much that hurt me? 

RACHEL:
 timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!

 oh come on, that was 20 years ago. get over it.

RACHEL:
 i cannot, i cannot believe that i invited you here   today.

 yeah, well you know what i cannot believe. that my so-called   sister, gets a 30% discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail.

RACHEL:
 ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> it's   forty five. 

 you bitch. you just think you're so perfect. with your   new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to ross who in turns   throws the towel in his hand down on the table> well let me tell you something.   your baby isn't even that cute.  <everyone sucks their breath in, in shock>

 too far, amy. too far. 

RACHEL:
 you take that back.

 no. 

RACHEL:
 take it back!

 no! what are you going to do? make me?

RACHEL:
 heey man, i work out.  <ross nods his head and points at her, in a yes manner> 

 so do i.

RACHEL:
 i do pilates. 

 i do yoga.

RACHEL:
 bring it on!  <amy pushes rachel and monica goes berserk and runs around the table> 

MONICA:
 put the plates in the boxes!! put the plates in the   boxes! 

RACHEL:
 did you just push me?

 uh, yeah i think i did. 

RACHEL:
 alright. thats it! <pushes amy back> 

 forget the bubblewrap! there isn't   time!  <rachel and amy 'fighting'.. they're really just trying to slap each other   and just keep slapping their hands> 

 frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!  <they go back to fighting and then it really gets on>

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! shouldn't we stop this?

JOEY:
 what? are you out of your mind? lets throw some jello   on them.  <amy starts spitting on rachel's hand and rachel is saying ew and pushes   her away> 

RACHEL:
 ew! gross.  <amy runs towards rachel and rachel puts her arm out, hand on amy's head   and amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, rachel is moving backwards   towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to   the floor> <everyone is shocked and monica faints and ross catches her> 

CHANDLER:
 alright! that is it. this is our apartment and   you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't   be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones   i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize   to her right now. 

 i'm sorry.

RACHEL:
 mon, i'm so sorry. 

CHANDLER:
 okay. thats better. now i want you to both apologize   to each other and mean it. 

 sorry.

CHANDLER:
 by the way, that fight was totally arousing. 

ROSS:
 dude. well done. you know what? if i die, and rachel   dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma. 

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah? well thanks. 

ROSS:
 so, so now do i get joey?

CHANDLER:
 okay, but you should know he eats five times a   day and shoves pennies up his nose.  <ross ponders that and walks away>

RACHEL:
 are you okay mon? 

MONICA:
 uh huh.. i mean these things happen. its' just a   plate. its not like somebody died. 

PHOEBE:
 it's all right. you can mourn. 

 thank you. it was so beautiful. <gets up and walks   towards the front door> i'm going to go to joeys and get the pies. 

JOEY:
 actually its not pies, its just pie. 

MONICA:
 i don't care. <pauses and realizes...> oh my   god. i've lost the will to scold. 

RACHEL:
 look amy, it got a little of control..um.. and i'm   sorry. you're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.. 

 so you're going to give me the baby?

RACHEL:
 uh. no.. i was going to let you use my ralph lauren   discount. 

 you are not going to regret this.  <they hug and rachel has this disgusted look on her face and then emma   starts crying> 

RACHEL:
 she needs changing.

CHANDLER:
 oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super-compentent   and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. i'll be right there   emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of   china> well.. what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first. commercial break    top of box so thoroughly, there isn't an inch of cardboard which isn't covered 

PHOEBE:
 hey, does monica know about her broken plates yet?

CHANDLER:
 nope...

PHOEBE:
 broke them all, huh?

CHANDLER:
 yep...

PHOEBE:
 you gonna tell her?

CHANDLER:
 nope...    put the plates back. you know, i think you were right, i don't think we should   use these plates again for a looong time.

MONICA:
 like only if the queen comes?

CHANDLER:
 maybe not even then. 

JOEY:
 hey! i did it. i called my producer. i told him i had   a family emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie   pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 no problem! next week: stealing...  

MONICA:
 bye plates!

JOEY:
 oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?  

MONICA:
 what? something happened with the plates?

 this kitty is mittens and this one is fitzhugh, and this little guy    in the cat condo is jinkies.

CHANDLER:
 yep.  that's a lot of cats jo lynn.  single are ya? 

CHANDLER:
 chandler bing.

JOEY:
 hey.  how come you're answering your own phone?  where's your crazy assistant? 

CHANDLER:
 what's up joe?

JOEY:
 okay, what have we always wanted to do together?

CHANDLER:
 braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?

JOEY:
 no, no, no.  when you get home tomorrow night, you and i are going to    be at the wizzards-knicks game . . .  courtside!

CHANDLER:
 courtside?  oh my god.

JOEY:
 yeah.  maybe michael jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with    his knee.

CHANDLER:
 that's so cool.  i'll let monica know.  

MONICA:
 hello?

CHANDLER:
 joey just called.  he's got courtside knicks tickets for him and    me tomorrow night.

MONICA:
 really?  but tomorrow night is the only night i get off from the restaurant.     if you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.

CHANDLER:
 but hey, it's courtside.  the cheerleaders are going to be right    in fr. . . 

MONICA:
 chandler look, i don't want to be one of those wives who says, "you    can't go to the game.  you have to spend time with me."  so, if you could just    realize it on your own . . . 

CHANDLER:
 i know.  you're right.  i want to see you too.  i've just got to    figure out a way to tell joey, you know?  he's really looking forward to this.

MONICA:
 tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.  tell him    that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.  tell him that    what little time we have is precious.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ah, ah . . .  i'll think of something.   

ROSS:
 wow!     dress . . . uh . . .  

RACHEL:
 well, i hope the ends of these sentences are good.

ROSS:
 well, well, they're good.  it's been a while since i've seen you like    this.  you, you clean up good.

RACHEL:
 oh well, well thank you.     stop.  stop looking at me like that.  the last time that happened,   that happened.  

ROSS:
 oh right, right.     so, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night    away from emma?

RACHEL:
 yeah, yeah.  phoebe and i are going to have so much fun.  and thank    you for watching the baby, by the way.

ROSS:
 oh, it's fine.  actually, i, i invited mike over.

RACHEL:
 phoebe's mike?

ROSS:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 i didn't know you guys hung out.

ROSS:
 we don't.  but i thought it would be nice to get to know him.  you know,    maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.

RACHEL:
 oh that's so cute:  ross and mike's first date.  is that going to be    awkward?  i mean, what are you guys going to talk about?

ROSS:
 i don't know.  but, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.     he plays piano; i played keyboards in college.  he's been divorced; i have some    experience in that area. 

RACHEL:
 yeah. 

PHOEBE:
 hi

RACHEL:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
    but if you need anything ross . . . 

ROSS:
 rach, rach, we'll be fine, all right?  you go have fun.

RACHEL:
 okay.  you too.  and i hope you score.  

 bye.

ROSS:
 so . . .  welcome.

 

ROSS:
 i got bottled breast milk.

 eh, why don't we start with the beer?

ROSS:
 okay.  

 yeah.

ROSS:
 you know, i, i used to, ah, play keyboards in college.

 ah?  

ROSS:
 no.

 okay.    

ROSS:
 um . . . ah . . . you know, i'm divorced.  um, phoebe, ah . . . phoebe    said you . . . you've been divorced?

 yeah.     talk about it.

ROSS:
  

  so, you're a paleontologist, right?

ROSS:
 yeah.

 my cousin's a paleontologist.

ROSS:
 ah?     a lot to talk about.    she pours two glasses of wine as chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase.    

MONICA:
 hi.

CHANDLER:
 hey.

MONICA:
 welcome home.

CHANDLER:
    oh well, look at you.

MONICA:
 yeah.  what do you think?

CHANDLER:
 well, it looks great.  it's just that . . . well, i'm wearing the    same thing underneath.  so . . .

MONICA:
 oh.

CHANDLER:
 see what i mean . . .  

JOEY:
 hey!  how come the door's locked?

MONICA:
 just a second.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 because i didn't know how to tell him that i couldn't go to the knicks    game.  so, i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa.

MONICA:
 so, you lied to him?

CHANDLER:
 achhh.  it's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.     

JOEY:
 hey!  open the door.  what's going on?   

JOEY:
 what are you . ..     like that?

MONICA:
 oh, because, um . . .  well, chandler's going to be home in a couple    of days.  so, i thought i would, you know, practice the art of seduction.

JOEY:
 oh, i thought i heard a man's voice before.

MONICA:
 oh i was just doing chandler's side of the conversation.  you know,    like, "hi, how do i look?"     turned on?"

JOEY:
 okay.     whoa, whoa.  why are there two glasses of wine out?

MONICA:
 because. . .  one of them is for you.    seeing something, peeps back.  chandler ducks.  monica returns with two glasses  

MONICA:
 cheers.   

CHANDLER:
 you know, it's funny.  i've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction    myself.     hi ya.

MONICA:
 you might want to keep practicing.

CHANDLER:
 yah. 

CHANDLER:
 it's joey.     hey joe.

JOEY:
 dude, come home!

CHANDLER:
 what? why?

JOEY:
 come . . .  home.

CHANDLER:
 look i, i can't.  what's going on?

JOEY:
 i don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . i think monica's cheatin'    on ya.  i told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you. 

JOEY:
 all right look.     deal with this, then i'm gonna.

CHANDLER:
 no!

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 no! wait!

JOEY:
 i heard him again!

CHANDLER:
    coming home.

JOEY:
 okay.  great.  i'll see you when you get here.  i'm gonna wait out in    the hall in case the dude comes out.

CHANDLER:
 is that really necessary?

JOEY:
 absolutely.  you'd do it for me.  not that you ever have to because i    know how to keep my women satisfied.  

ROSS:
 shouldn't the pizza be here by now?  i mean, they said thirty minutes    or less.  well, how long has it been?

    so, do you like the beer?

ROSS:
 i do.  i do.  although, it's actually a lager.

 huh.  

ROSS:
 i don't know.  we could look it up.

   

PHOEBE:
 oh god.  remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around    talking about you and ross?

RACHEL:
 oh god.  it seems like forever ago.

PHOEBE:
 i know.  

RACHEL:
 well, um . . . i don't know.  i mean, for a long time nothing.  but    you know, actually right before you picked me up, ross and i had a . . . ah    . . . little thing.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god!  i love things.  what happened?

RACHEL:
 well, um, first he told me he liked how i looked.  and, ah, then we    had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.

PHOEBE:
 eye-contact?

RACHEL:
 mm-hmm.

PHOEBE:
 i hope you were using protection.

    gentlemen at the end of the bar.

RACHEL:
 oh.  

PHOEBE:
 oooh.  let's do.  let's send them mashed potatoes.

RACHEL:
 no!  wait!  no, no.  don't do that!  that's going to make them think    they can come over here.

PHOEBE:
 so?  what if they do?

RACHEL:
 well, we're not here to meet guys.  you have a boyfriend, i have a    b. . . baby and a ross.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.  we're just having fun.     you know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."  

MONICA:
 chandler, you have to tell joey that you're not in tulsa.

CHANDLER:
 don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating    on me, than for him to think that i'm cheating on him?     i heard it.

MONICA:
 i don't want him to think that i'm having an affair.

CHANDLER:
 all right.  i've got a plan.  i'll go down the fire escape.

MONICA:
 yes, because all good plans start with, "i'll go down the fire escape."

CHANDLER:
 hear me out woman.  i'll go down the fire escape.  then, i'll wait    for a while.  then, when i come up the stairs, it'll be just like i just got    back from tulsa.  then, joey and i will come in and see that there's no guy    in here.

MONICA:
 aren't you afraid that joey's going to figure all of this out?     i heard it.  

CHANDLER:
 i'm just going to wait for a little while.

MONICA:
 scary pigeon's back?

CHANDLER:
 it's huge.    the plastic tripod are left in the otherwise empty pizza box.  mike is making    hollow popping noises with his mouth.  he begins to speak, but stops and pops    his lips a few more times and takes a drink.  ross smiles as if he has thought   

RACHEL:
 oh my god.  i can't believe you live in that building.  my grandmother    lives in that building.  ida green?  no sense of personal space?  kind of smells    like chicken?  looks like a potato.

 "spuds" is your grandmother?

RACHEL:
 that's my bubby!

 so, we're on our way to a couple of parties.  um. . . maybe we can get    your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.

PHOEBE:
 yeah. . . i'm sorry.  we weren't really looking for anything to happen    with you guys.  i, i have a boyfriend. 

 all right. it's no big deal. 

 so, she has a boyfriend. what is your situation? 

 oh, well, it's complicated. i don't actually have a boyfriend.  but    um. . . 

 then, can i have your number? 

  

 okay.  

 oh sure.   

  

 okay, thanks. i'll give you a call later tonight. 

 great. 

 bye 

 bye.    are going to be so happy together. what were you thinking?

RACHEL:
 i don't know.  he was cute, and he liked me.  it was an impulse.

PHOEBE:
 what about ross?  what about your moment?  don't you want to talk to    ross about it?

RACHEL:
 no.  no, because i know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.  "hey    ross, you know, i think we had a moment before."

RACHEL:
 

RACHEL:
    it."

RACHEL:
  

RACHEL:
    really tell each other how we're really feeling?"

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i see what you mean.  by the way, nice ross imitation.

RACHEL:
 oh, thanks.

PHOEBE:
 but, your rachel wasn't whiny enough.

RACHEL:
 

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 well, the point is, maybe i should just stop waiting around for moments    with ross, you know?  i should just . . . move on with my life.

PHOEBE:
 really?  you're moving on from ross?

RACHEL:
 i don't know.  do i have to decide right now?

PHOEBE:
 well, you kind of just did.  that guy is going to call you tonight.     ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.

RACHEL:
 oh god, ross.  ross is going to pick up the phone.  oh, i have to get    my number back.     he's gone.

PHOEBE:
    he's gone."      ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while mike blows his cheeks out.   

 

ROSS:
 so soon?

 well, yeah.

ROSS:
 okay.  well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.

 ah, you mean lager.

ROSS:
 ah yeah.  good times. 

   

 hello?

PHOEBE:
    is um, is ross near you?

 uh, no.  i just left.

PHOEBE:
 well, you have to go back in.

 wha . . .?  go back?  to the "land where time stands still"?

PHOEBE:
 i'm so sorry honey, but, okay, rachel gave this guy her number and,    um, she doesn't want ross to answer the phone.  so, you have to intercept all    his calls.

 i can't do that!

PHOEBE:
 

RACHEL:
 oh give me , , ,     listen.  i know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?  if you do this i .    . . phoebe will . . . do anything you want.  seriously, i'm talking dirty stuff.

PHOEBE:
 all right.    about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

 all right.  i'll do it.     but really, how much dirtier can it get?

PHOEBE:
  

 hey buddy.

ROSS:
 uh, hi.

 um, can i come back in?

ROSS:
  

    have to talk about.

ROSS:
   

JOEY:
 wow!  that didn't take long.  i thought you said tulsa was, like a three    hour flight.

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 that's right.  you're husband's home.  so, now the sex can stop. 

MONICA:
 what are you saying?

CHANDLER:
 joey said that you're in here with another man.

MONICA:
 there's no man in here.  how dare you accuse me of that.   

JOEY:
 all right.  all right.  then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend    take a look around, huh?     bwa-ah-ah! 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 all right.  well, i'll check the guest room.

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 there's nobody here joe.

JOEY:
 i guess not.

MONICA:
 i can't believe you thought i was cheating.     own me an apology.

JOEY:
 yeah, right monica.  i'm so sorry.

MONICA:
    happen to anyone.  all right, see ya.

JOEY:
    whoa.  wait a minute.  wait a minute.  if you just got back from tulsa, how    did your suitcase beat you here?

CHANDLER:
    can't put that in the closet? 

 so, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the    same thing.  fascinating isn't it.

ROSS:
 maybe you should look up "fascinating." 

 i'll get it.     hello?  ross's place.  mike speaking.     

ROSS:
    here. 

JOEY:
 what's going on?

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry.  i, i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend    the night with monica and i, i didn't know . . .  i didn't think you'd understand.

JOEY:
 what? you think i'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be    with his wife?  huh?  do you think i'm like, "duh."   

MONICA:
 joey?

JOEY:
 yeah?  

MONICA:
 i don't know what to say.  we shouldn't have lied to you.

CHANDLER:
 yeah.  i feel so bad.  is there anything i can do to make it up to    you?

JOEY:
    you said you couldn't.  but then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a    bump on the head.

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry.  that's the one thing i can't do.  i promised i'd be with    monica.

JOEY:
 all right.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 you should go to the game.  it's okay.  i want you to.

CHANDLER:
 really?  you're gonna be okay?

MONICA:
 yeah, i'll be fine.  you know, maybe i'll stay here and practice the    art of seduction.

CHANDLER:
 you're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?

MONICA:
 it's gonna be so hot!  

CHANDLER:
 okay, bye.

MONICA:
 have fun.

JOEY:
 thanks.     here's your ticket.

CHANDLER:
 hey, listen.  i'm never going to lie to you again, okay?  and i want    you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.

JOEY:
 thanks man.  

JOEY:
 where are you going?

CHANDLER:
 game's tomorrow night joe.   

RACHEL:
 hi. 

ROSS:
 oh god.  

RACHEL:
 oh . . . 

 i'm so glad you're back.  

PHOEBE:
 oh.

RACHEL:
 wow.  so, what did you guys do?

ROSS:
 oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and mike played with the boundaries    of normal social conduct.

 it's true.  i did.

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 that was fun pheebs.

PHOEBE:
 i know.  that was fun.  

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 rachel, lock the door.  lock the door,  seriously.

RACHEL:
 oh shoot.  i forgot to pay phoebe for the drinks.     wait, wait.  sorry.  did he call?     did that guy call?

 no.  just his mom.

RACHEL:
 oh, around 8:30?

RACHEL:
 then, again at 9:00?

 

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:

RACHEL:

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
    mind.  

ROSS:
 hey you guys.  

 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey.  i'll be right back.  i've got to go to the bathroom.     

PHOEBE:
 ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "merry christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 i can't believe you're not gonna be here for christmas.

ROSS:
 you're really not coming back?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i don't get it done, i'll be fired.

MONICA:
 it's so unfair, you don't even like your job!

CHANDLER:
 so, who does?

PHOEBE:
 oh, i like my job.

JOEY:
 i *love* my job.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i can't *wait* to go back to work.

ROSS:
 i can't get *enough* dinosaurs!

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry, i won't be here.

MONICA:
 it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand.

CHANDLER:
 thanks. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 did i not mention that?

MONICA:
 no!

CHANDLER:
  *opening credits* 

CHANDLER:
 all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  

 hey!

 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey. where've you been?

 i was, uh, checking out that insurance company's christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and i just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- so i stole ther ham. 

CHANDLER:
 

 my kid's in a play right now.

CHANDLER:
 y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up! 

 

CHANDLER:
 well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!

 *now* it feels like christmas.

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.

 you can come to my house!

CHANDLER:
 haha, no thanks!

 that was a nice pep-talk.

CHANDLER:
 oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.

 so, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?

CHANDLER:
 typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional...  

PHOEBE:
 so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some very important people to me.  "went to the store, sat on santa's lap. asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. said all you need is to write them a song. now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. no, don't sing along. monica, moncia, have a happy hanukkah. saw santa claus, he said hello to ross. and please tell joey, christmas will be snowy! and rachel and chandler, have err-umm-glander!!" happy holidays, everybody!  

RACHEL:
 okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet.

CHANDLER:
 i can save you time ladies, i'm right here.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you.

RACHEL:
 we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.

CHANDLER:
 what? that's terrible!

PHOEBE:
 no-no, we do it every year!

CHANDLER:
 oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.

PHOEBE:
 no, yeah, we never find them! she's always best at us, that wily... minx.

RACHEL:
 don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok?

CHANDLER:
 no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!

PHOEBE:
 oh no, we have to!

CHANDLER:
 no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too.

PHOEBE:
 well then, you should look with us.

CHANDLER:
 why?

RACHEL:
 chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas?

CHANDLER:
 no, i have a great idea for a present for her.

PHOEBE:
 oh, that's it? 

RACHEL:
 chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?

CHANDLER:
 if i help, we can find 'em faster!

RACHEL:
 that's right! 

PHOEBE:
 ooh ooh, we have a live one!

RACHEL:
 oh, it's a macy's bag! 

RACHEL:
 oh.

PHOEBE:
 ooh, who's it for?

RACHEL:
   

JOEY:
 rach, these are for you.

RACHEL:
 wiper blades. i don't even have a car.

JOEY:
 no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.

CHANDLER:
 ok, pheebs, your turn.

PHOEBE:
 ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i was getting gas?

JOEY:
 uh-huh.

PHOEBE:
 you guuuyys.

JOEY:
 and for ross, mr. sweet-tooth.

ROSS:
 you got me a cola drink?

CHANDLER:
 and, a lemon lime.

ROSS:
 well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater.

CHANDLER:
 and last but not least. 

JOEY:
 they're ribbed for *your* pleasure.  

ROSS:
 ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?

 cool!

ROSS:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 come on ben. 

ROSS:
 years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...

CHANDLER:
 

 santa! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

ROSS:
 what are you doing here, santa?

CHANDLER:
 well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?

ROSS:
 i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence i'd never thought i'd say. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!

ROSS:
 thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.

CHANDLER:
 why?

ROSS:
 because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.

CHANDLER:
 but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.

ROSS:
 i'm sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me.

CHANDLER:
 fine, i'll give the suit back. 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 santa? really?

MONICA:
 yeah, is that okay?

CHANDLER:
 did your dad ever dress up like santa?

MONICA:
 no.

CHANDLER:
 then it's okaaay!  

CHANDLER:
 you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your families. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve. 

CHANDLER:
 did i not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- alright, look, go! go home, okay? merry christmas! go. 

CHANDLER:
 good, god's speed, good people! 

 naah... i couldn't leave you alone.

CHANDLER:
 ah. thanks.

 besides, i can't leave until their christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.

CHANDLER:
 ah.  

MONICA:
 hi honey! we're all here; we just want to wish you a merry christmas.

 

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
 ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!

MONICA:
 so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?

CHANDLER:
 ah, well no, it's just uh, me and wendy.

MONICA:
 wendy? -- that sounds like a girl's name.

CHANDLER:
 it is. did i... not tell you about her?

MONICA:
 umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. where is everybody else?

CHANDLER:
 i sent them home.

MONICA:
 ohh, you are such a good boss! is she pretty?

CHANDLER:
 uhh, uh...

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 i don't know!

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 i don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.

MONICA:
 what does she do there?

CHANDLER:
 oh, she's regional vice president; she's... just below me.

MONICA:
 she did what?

CHANDLER:
 be-low me!

JOEY:
 ahh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma?

MONICA:
 *what*??

CHANDLER:
 well, she... she didn't win...

MONICA:
 alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work.

CHANDLER:
 well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she's probably...

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 honey, there's really nothing to worry about.

MONICA:
 okay.

CHANDLER:
 i'm serious!

MONICA:
 okay!

CHANDLER:
 merry christmas.

MONICA:
 merry christmas.

CHANDLER:
 merry christmas, you guys!

 

PHOEBE:
   

CHANDLER:
 

 ah. fun conversation?

CHANDLER:
 ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen.

 huh? really? -- hm, that'd be so terrible? 

CHANDLER:
 this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  

CHANDLER:
 whoa-ho, back off, missy! 

 

CHANDLER:
 i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... 

 you are to me... 

CHANDLER:
 

 so? i'm married. 

CHANDLER:
 i'm *happily* married.

 oh. - what's *that* like?

CHANDLER:
 right. so, i'm sorry...

 seriously? happily married. so that phone call before, that was ... happy?

CHANDLER:
 well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.

 okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending christmas with me?   

CHANDLER:
 i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!

MONICA:
 really?

CHANDLER:
 you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... 

MONICA:
 well, not anymore.

CHANDLER:
 but we don't do that.

MONICA:
 i know, i just thought it would be fun.

CHANDLER:
 how drunk are you?

MONICA:
 drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 okay! 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 what?

MONICA:
 this doesn't feel weird!

CHANDLER:
 i know.

MONICA:
 you're a really good kisser.

CHANDLER:
 well, i have kissed over four women. 

MONICA:
 hm-hmm!

CHANDLER:
 okay! 

MONICA:
 wow! you are really fast!

CHANDLER:
 it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.

MONICA:
 we're gonna see each other naked.

CHANDLER:
 yep!

MONICA:
 do you wanna do it at the same time?

CHANDLER:
 count of three?

MONICA:
 one!

CHANDLER:
 two!

MONICA:
 two!

 three! 

CHANDLER:
 well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.

MONICA:
 eh, we weren't that close anyway!

CHANDLER:
 eh!   

CHANDLER:
 so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?

MONICA:
 well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him.

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this.

MONICA:
 i think you're better than you think you are.

CHANDLER:
 really? okay, so...

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?

MONICA:
 yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 right!  

MONICA:
 i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.

CHANDLER:
 okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! 

MONICA:
 you're so efficient. i love you!

CHANDLER:
 let's go! 

MONICA:
 no-no-no, wait! we need something old!

CHANDLER:
 oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve.

MONICA:
 that'll work!

CHANDLER:
 i don't think so.

MONICA:
 okay, now we just need something borrowed!

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 that's stealing!

CHANDLER:
 no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress. 

MONICA:
 ohh. 

CHANDLER:
 okay, one thing at a time.   

MONICA:
 listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that.

CHANDLER:
 ehh.

MONICA:
 eh, you work for that.

CHANDLER:
 look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.

MONICA:
 you do?!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.

MONICA:
 oh, you're so sweet. 

CHANDLER:
 eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.

MONICA:
 you thought about that?

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 how many kids were we gonna have?

CHANDLER:
 uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.

MONICA:
 what else did you think about?

CHANDLER:
 well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 sure you do.

MONICA:
 no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage.

CHANDLER:
 you sure?

MONICA:
 uh-hmm.

CHANDLER:
 i love you so much.

MONICA:
 i love you.  

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 really? you're not gonna return it?

RACHEL:
 well, not this second!

PHOEBE:
  

RACHEL:
 oh wow, it's so beautiful...

ROSS:
 wow, it really is! 

MONICA:
 "wendy" is a fat girl name.

PHOEBE:
 aren't we done with that?

MONICA:
 okay, fine. let's talk about snow. -- do you think it's snowing in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine? 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

ROSS:
 oh my god...

JOEY:
 hey-heeyyy - look at that, it's a christmas miracle!

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?

CHANDLER:
 monica.

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
 i never want to leave you again!

MONICA:
 but i thought if you left, you get fired.

CHANDLER:
 turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.

MONICA:
 what?

ROSS:
 what, you, you really quit your job?

CHANDLER:
 yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?

RACHEL:
 what do you really want to do?

CHANDLER:
 

MONICA:
 oh my god!

CHANDLER:
 i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it.

MONICA:
 no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great!

CHANDLER:
 thanks!

PHOEBE:
 chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined.

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 now give me my real gift. 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
  

ROSS:
 oh, hey... 

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 wha... are you kidding? i can't return this.

CHANDLER:
 i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys.

JOEY:
 mine's is to lilian myers.

CHANDLER:
 i don't have a *job*! *closing credits* 

CHANDLER:
 actuary... no. book-keeper... no. topless dancer... 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

MONICA:
 good morning, tiger! i'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight.  you're gonna get me good and pregnant.

CHANDLER:
 i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed! i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life.

MONICA:
 well, i just lost my erection.

CHANDLER:
 i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself? 

MONICA:
 you're supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you wanna be now. it's exciting.

CHANDLER:
 but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start. 

MONICA:
 hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications,  and categorize jobs by industry. there could be folders and files! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!

MONICA:
 i know!!! my erection is back!   

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 joey, can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?

JOEY:
 okay. phoebe thank you. 

JOEY:
: pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian?

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, it's just, i'm a little short on cash. 

JOEY:
 if you want i could loan you some money?

PHOEBE:
 oh no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends. no, that's why richard dreyfuss and i don't speak anymore.

JOEY:
 oh, hey, how about this? wanna be an extra on my show?

PHOEBE:
 you could do that?

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah. the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, i'm gonna be on tv!

JOEY:
 okay, now. i gotta tell you, being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.

PHOEBE:
 oh, really?

JOEY:
 no it is awesome! 

ROSS:
 hi guys.

 

PHOEBE:
 wow! hey, why are you all dressed up?

ROSS:
 rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone. doesn't she look cute?

JOEY:
 she sure does. why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?

RACHEL:
 well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" i'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!

ROSS:
 i think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a-line skirts. can i get a blue bow? 

MONICA:
  photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.

CHANDLER:
 how long was i in there?

MONICA:
 okay. let us start with the a's. advertising.

CHANDLER:
 wait. advertising! that's a great idea!

MONICA:
 don't you want to look through the rest?

CHANDLER:
 i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though.

MONICA:
 you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder!

CHANDLER:
 i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? "cheese. it's milk that you chew." "crackers. because your  cheese needs a buddy." "a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"

MONICA:
 i got one. "socks. because your family's feet deserve the best."

CHANDLER:
 honey? leave it to the pros.

MONICA:
 i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency.  maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone.

CHANDLER:
 "the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."

MONICA:
 "marriage. it's not for everybody." 

RACHEL:
 that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl. 

ROSS:
 yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread. 

RACHEL:
 i'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . 

 who the hell are you?

RACHEL:
 i'm the hell person whose office this is!

ROSS:
 good one, rach.

 i'm gavin mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.

RACHEL:
 excuse me?

 oh, your baby's so cute. why did you put a pink bow on a boy? 

PHOEBE:
 joey, look at me! i'm a nurse!

JOEY:
 yes you are. i think it may be time for my sponge bath. sorry, i'm just so used to hitting on the extras.  so, are you excited about your scene?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! but i'm a little shaky and nervous. 

JOEY:
 oh, relax. don't be. you'll be fine, you'll be fine. they'll probably just make you stand in the back.

 okay, okay, okay!  you're gonna move on "action!" you're gonna walk over to the operating table. you're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. don't walk too fast! but don't doddle.

PHOEBE:
 okay, now. what?

 and...action!! 

 cut! cut!

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm just a little nervous.

 well, don't be.

PHOEBE:
 okay, that helps.

 and...action! 

 cut!

JOEY:
 hey, you know what? don't worry, pheebs! it usually takes me three takes too! 

 and...action!  

 so, do you have any other question about advertising?

CHANDLER:
 no, no. but let me show you what i can do. "bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."

 monica warned me you might do that. i actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 

CHANDLER:
 really? that's great!

 it's an unpaid internship.

CHANDLER:
 it's funny. when you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."

 come on now. monica has a good job. and it's not like you have a family to support.

CHANDLER:
 actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight.  actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now.

 stop!

 okay. 

RACHEL:
 wait a minute! what do you mean, you're taking over my job?

 well, while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job.

RACHEL:
 a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.

 clearly you've never been to sandles paradise island.

RACHEL:
 alright! don't get too comfortable there, because i'm back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was.  i can't say that i care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. 

 i can't say i care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.

RACHEL:
 excuse me?

ROSS:
 rach we have a code brown situation.

RACHEL:
 can you please, please take care of it for me?

ROSS:
 alright, but you have to do one sometime.

RACHEL:
 let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?

 well, there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together.

RACHEL:
 that's right. you're very cheeky for a temp. 

 i'm not a temp. i was transferred here from another department.

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department?

 oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.

RACHEL:
 did they mention that i'm rubber and you're glue?

 

RACHEL:
 oh, hi mr. zelner.

 rachel, i see you've met gavin. i must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. but then,  gavin to the rescue. super gavin!

RACHEL:
 that's great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to?

 well, that's up to mr. zelner. i'm sure he will make the right decision.

RACHEL:
 

 incidentally, when are you coming back?

RACHEL:
 today.

 you said two weeks.

RACHEL:
 no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening. 

JOEY:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey. so, what did he say?

JOEY:
 well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so i'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." 

 "if your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, i'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, i can't do this. i'm not an actor.

JOEY:
 that's right, you're not. you're a nurse. you're nurse with tray. 

PHOEBE:
 joey.

JOEY:
 no, no. nurse with tray doesn't know joey, she doesn't have time for friends. she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!

PHOEBE:
 who dies?

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
 yes, doctor.

JOEY:
 okay.

 okay, let's try this one more time. 

PHOEBE:
 hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming!

 and...action!

PHOEBE:
 

 the rest of the scene.

PHOEBE:
 okay, from the top, people! 

RACHEL:
 listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i didn't come back today,  they were gonna fire me.

ROSS:
 what? no, that's illegal. i'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...

RACHEL:
 alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they didn't actually say that. i'm just afraid if i don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. 

ROSS:
 what about emma? we don't have a nanny.

RACHEL:
 i know. you know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today?

ROSS:
 absolutely. just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.

RACHEL:
 come on, i don't know what else to do.

ROSS:
 fine, fine. 

RACHEL:
 ross?

ROSS:
 huh?

RACHEL:
 you're pretty. 

CHANDLER:
 whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it.  maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.

ROSS:
 so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now?

CHANDLER:
 yeah. 

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ross is here so...

ROSS:
 yeah, and i was really hoping that i could hang out. what do you feel like doing?

MONICA:
 we're gonna have sex.

ROSS:
 i don't feel like having sex. maybe we can watch a movie or something.

MONICA:
 let me put it this way. we're having sex whether you're here or not.

ROSS:
 pants off bing! 

RACHEL:
 alright. now that i'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?

 well, i've changed your screensaver from that picture of *nsync.

RACHEL:
 hey, they were popular when i left!

 also, i've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.

RACHEL:
 well, i should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?

 that's gonna take weeks. why don't just let me take care of the presentation?

RACHEL:
 oh, no no no no. i see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. okay, i've had it for five years,  and i know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!

 fine. 

RACHEL:
 

 hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.

RACHEL:
 fine, i will.  

ROSS:
 hey.

CHANDLER:
 hey.

ROSS:
 you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine.

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete  and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.

MONICA:
 

ROSS:
 here's an idea. you walk into a room...take a quick scan!

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 oh god, i have to tell you something. you're not pregnant. 

MONICA:
 what are you talking about?

CHANDLER:
 that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it.

MONICA:
 what!? you faked it?

ROSS:
 you know what? i don't need a tie. i mean, it's better, open collar. you know, it's more casual  

PHOEBE:
 joey, listen. i can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. yesterday i was a nurse, and today i'm a waitress at a cafe?

JOEY:
 oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. it's okay. 

PHOEBE:
 well, it's not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. and now suddenly i'm the waitress? that's gonna confuse my fans. 

JOEY:
 maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.

PHOEBE:
 uhuh. because i'm a single mother, supporting my two children.

JOEY:
 nice.

PHOEBE:
 wait a minute. dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. wouldn't i come over to say hi to him?

JOEY:
 no, no. see, you and drake are having a fight. 

PHOEBE:
 about what?

JOEY:
 he slept with you and then never called you.

PHOEBE:
 and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky.

 okay, okay, from the top. and...action!

 so, i'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.

 i'm surprised to, but yet here i am. 

 cut, cut! what are you doing!?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, well, i'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.

 me too!

 me too!

JOEY:
 oh, calm down! she means on the show! we need some new extras around here! 

 

RACHEL:
 yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think i'm caught up on everything. so ask me anything!

 how do you fix the chair?

RACHEL:
 except that! 

 good, because it's in ten minutes.

RACHEL:
 what? i can't do that! i have the baby, and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.

 well, then gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. ralph needs to leave early today. he's going helicopter shopping.

RACHEL:
 well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead,  no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!

 you can do the presentation.

RACHEL:
 no, i can't, i have a baby.

 i'll watch her.

RACHEL:
 why would you do that?

 because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.

RACHEL:
 that's really nice.

 i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.

RACHEL:
 then you're not gonna like what's coming. 

 i'm really fine, don't worry, i'm great with children.  

JOEY:
 please don't fire my friend. just let me talk to her.

 okay, okay. but this is her last chance. 

JOEY:
 thank you, thank you. how about i do something for you? tomorrow, i'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?

JOEY:
 hey, listen pheebs. i was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit drake,  you just wait on the tables?

PHOEBE:
 i can't do that. i'm an actor. i have a process.

JOEY:
 you're a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it.

PHOEBE:
 wait a minute, i see what's happening here. you're threatened. 

JOEY:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i'm so good in this scene that i'm stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni 'cause i just raised the bar. come join me up here!

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 you faked it? you couldn't have faked it!

CHANDLER:
 oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises. 

MONICA:
 guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?

CHANDLER:
 that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.

MONICA:
 like a month?

CHANDLER:
 or a year?

MONICA:
 really, you want to wait a year?

CHANDLER:
 it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. "pants. like shorts, but longer."  it'll probably be more than a year. 

MONICA:
 i really wanna have a baby.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back. 

MONICA:
 no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.

CHANDLER:
 i quit and you learn what i do?

MONICA:
 it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby.  i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy.  there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. 

CHANDLER:
 i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 

MONICA:
 it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control.  i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer?  messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!?  where will all the ribbons go!?!

CHANDLER:
 should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?

MONICA:
 yes, please!

CHANDLER:
 oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time.

MONICA:
 i wish i could say the same. i'm a little shook up! 

 i know you botched that operation on purpose. i can't prove it yet, but when i do, you'll be going to jail for murder.  i don't care if you are my brother.

 i'm not your brother.

CHANDLER:
 hey

JOEY:
 hey. so where's mon?

CHANDLER:
 oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight.

JOEY:
 and you're not helping?

CHANDLER:
 i tried, but apparantly singing "i will survive" in a helium voice    - not helping. 

ROSS:
 hey you guys!

 

RACHEL:
 shhh don't say that loud, gunther's gonna want to hug me.

ROSS:
 uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. this is molly  . molly, chandler, joey.

 hi.

 hi. 

ROSS:
 ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.

JOEY:
 you damn right i am, i've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.

RACHEL:
 ok, you know what, i'm just gonna take her outside.

 no, you stay, i'll do it 

RACHEL:
 ok, thank you.

 nice to meet you guys 

JOEY:
 yeah, you too. 

RACHEL:
 oh, wow, molly is just great!

ROSS:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

RACHEL:
 what? you really think she's hot?

CHANDLER:
 are you kidding? if i wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.

RACHEL:
 and joey?

JOEY:
 how do you think she's doing?

RACHEL:
 am i the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? ross?

ROSS:
 eh, i mean, i mena she's not unattractive but hot? i ....

RACHEL:
 thank you! 

CHANDLER:
 now that rachel's gone?

RACHEL:
 so hot i cried myself to sleep last night.   opening credits 

PHOEBE:
 hey mike, what's the capital of peru?

 lima.

PHOEBE:
 no. it starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". helpfully    with a "to" in the middle.

 you know, kinda think of it, the capital of peru is "vtox".    

PHOEBE:
 what?

 ok, i don't want to freak you out or anything, but i think i just saw a    rat in your cupboard.

PHOEBE:
 

 what, is he your pet rat?

PHOEBE:
 well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who    i put food out for, you know. kinda like santa. except santa doesn't poop on    the plate of cookies.

 you can't keep a rat in your appartment! they're extremely unsanitary,    and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.

PHOEBE:
 what are those?

 i don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. you have to get    rid of it!

PHOEBE:
 ok, fine, if it means that much to you i'll get rid of bob.

 thank you.

PHOEBE:
 so weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.     

RACHEL:
 hello.

 hello

RACHEL:
 gavin, i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma    yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an appology.

 for what?

RACHEL:
 well, when we first met, you know, i thought you were pompous    and arrogant and obnoxious ...

 is this your first appology?

RACHEL:
 no, i just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. and    i-i think you're a really good guy and i'm sorry that i misjudged you. 

 good morning! 

RACHEL:
 hello.    i am just really really happy ...    obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so i'll just wait    'till it's finished.

 what?

RACHEL:
 i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!

 i wasn't checking her out. i'm in fashion, i was looking at her    skirt. or was it pants? i didn't really see what happened below the ass area.

RACHEL:
 oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.

 why do you even care if i was looking at her? are you jealous?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah, i'm jealous. "oh gavin, please, please look at    my ass".    think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she's your    subordinate.

 i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag.

RACHEL:
 that is totally different for two reasons. one - i didn't know    that you knew that. and two, i wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had    a deap meaningful relationship.

 huh. what's tag's last name?

RACHEL:
 it was ...    name. it was just "tag". you know, like cher, or, you know, moses.

 but it was a deap meaningful relationship.

RACHEL:
 oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely    right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name    was morgan! huh!

 it was jones.

RACHEL:
 yeah well what are you, his boyfriend? 

JOEY:
 man, i wish i had a nanny like you.

 you mean, when you were a baby.

JOEY:
 sure. 

MONICA:
 would you stop staring at her?

CHANDLER:
 i wasn't staring. i was leering.

MONICA:
 what's the big deal with her? maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind    of way.

ROSS:
 yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it's right there    in your face. me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive. makes me    feel like i earned it.

CHANDLER:
 looks like joey is doing allright with her.

MONICA:
 yeah. hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl    for once.

 

ROSS:
 ok, i'll be home right after work. ok, by emma-wemma-demma, i love you    - wovyou dovyou ...

 bye

MONICA:
 they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.

 i think it's sweet. 

 bye, emma-wemma-demma.

RACHEL:
    you didn't go after her.

JOEY:
 why not?

RACHEL:
 because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything    to, you know, drive her away.

JOEY:
 so, what, you think i'm just gonna sleep with her and never call    her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?    about right.

ROSS:
 come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? just - just    forget about her, ok? just, she's off limits.

JOEY:
 oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? now that you told    me i can't have it makes me want her even more!

ROSS:
 what are you, a child?

JOEY:
 yes!

ROSS:
 joey, come on now, for me! please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy    on someone else.

JOEY:
 fine. 

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 hey mikey

 hey p

PHOEBE:
 what are you doing?

 setting rat traps.

PHOEBE:
 to kill bob??

 no, no, to test his neck strength.

PHOEBE:
 no, mike, i don't want to kill him! i thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.

 ok, ok, i'll throw away the traps.

PHOEBE:
 i'll find bob, i'll get him. bob?   oh wait, i think i hear him. oh - oh my god! bob had babies!    bob's a mom!

 better think of a new name for him.

PHOEBE:
 i don't know, i kinda like bob for a girl.

 i don't know, i mean i'm not sure   ...

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, we killed bob!

 maybe it wasn't bob, maybe it was a mouse.

PHOEBE:
 suzie?  

ROSS:
 whazzup??

CHANDLER:
 seriously dude, 3 years ago.

ROSS:
 listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today. can you just keep    an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly?

CHANDLER:
 you don't trust him?

ROSS:
 wh - no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked    for her daughter, the "hot nanny".

CHANDLER:
 is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?    because i could get a job any day now.

ROSS:
 you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, i'm    sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do    this for me?

CHANDLER:
 allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because you know    as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,    he's going to have sex with it.

ROSS:
 well we gotta do something, ok? nannies like her don't grow on trees.  

CHANDLER:
 picturing that tree?

ROSS:
 i am, yes.  

CHANDLER:
 where you going, joe? 

JOEY:
 for a walk.

CHANDLER:
 oh. you mind if i join you?

JOEY:
 actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize    my thoughts.

CHANDLER:
 your thoughts? plural?

JOEY:
 allright, fine, i only have one thought! it's about the hot nanny, i gotta    see her!

CHANDLER:
 i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe.

JOEY:
 now you're telling me i can't see her?? you guys are killing me!    she's forbidden fruit! it's like ... like she's the princess and i'm the stable    boy ... why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me go over    there?

CHANDLER:
 yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can't let you go.

JOEY:
 huh. interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the    world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.

CHANDLER:
 great novels? 

JOEY:
 fine ... mediocre porn  

 gavin mitchelle's office.

RACHEL:
 rachel green's office!! give me that phone!    hello, this is rachel green, how can i help you? uh huh ... ok then ... i'll    pass you back to your son 

 hey mom! no, that's just my secretary. 

RACHEL:
 um, excuse me gavin, i have a question i need to ask you.

 mom, i'll call you later. yeah. 

RACHEL:
 if you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?

 thank god you finally said that, i saw you make a note on your    pad three hours ago.    don't i?

RACHEL:
 oh, please, i don't care about you enough to bug me. in fact,    from now on, i'm going take the high road. and i'm going be very very nice to    you, you "momma's boy", starting right now. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL:

 pleased to meet you.

MONICA:
 pleased to meet you. so you're coming to rachel's party tonight?

RACHEL:
 oh no no no no no, gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his    mother. 

 well i don't mind, i'll cancel. i would never miss my secretary's birthday.    

RACHEL:
 why did you invite him?? i can't stand that guy!

MONICA:
 you were just being so nice to him!

RACHEL:
 i was faking it! can't you tell when i'm being fake? 

RACHEL:
 hey, mr philips, nice suit!

MONICA:
 right there! that was so fake!

RACHEL:
 shh! 

RACHEL:
    last person i want to see.

MONICA:
 oh, you're welcome for the party. i'm glad you're having a good time.

RACHEL:
 god, i hope he doesn't show up. of course he's not gonna show up, the guy    hates me.

MONICA:
 does he?

RACHEL:
 what?

MONICA:
 maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. it's like in first    grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly    had a crush on me?

RACHEL:
 oh, monica, you think skippy liked you? honey, all those buys had a bet    to see if he can knock you over.

 

RACHEL:
 oh, ok, thank you.    see in her?

MONICA:
 wouldn't kick her out of bed. no more vodka for me!  

JOEY:
 hey rach, so can i sing happy birthday to you now?

RACHEL:
 yeah, sure!

JOEY:
 oh ...    later 

MONICA:
 hey rach, somebody got you shoes!

RACHEL:
 oh, give me!  

PHOEBE:
 be careful, be careful! these are my rat babies!

 yeah. we have rat babies now.

RACHEL:
 ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?

MONICA:
 so this is what a stroke feels like.

PHOEBE:
 i had to bring them! we killed their mother, they're our responsibility    now. you know, they require constant care. you should know that, rachel, you're    a mother.

RACHEL:
 are you comparing my daughter to a rat?

PHOEBE:
 no! seven rats! i think we should take them home, we need feed    them.

RACHEL:
 whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?

PHOEBE:
 well i'm sorry rachel, but i'm not like you, ok? not everyone    can afford help.  

ROSS:
 where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 we have to stop them before something happens!

CHANDLER:
    

JOEY:
 so you see, molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline.    it takes a lot of hard work.

 so where did you study?

JOEY:
 oh, i didn't go to college.

 no, where did you study acting?

JOEY:
 molly ... people don't study acting ... 

ROSS:
 molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?

 sure, i'll go check on emma.

ROSS:
 thanx. 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 what do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?

JOEY:
 no ... the leather sticks to my ass. you know, this isn't fair.    what makes you think that i'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?    huh? can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her,    and might want something real?    way about anyone since rachel, ok? i didn't think i could ever love again. 

 come on! joe!

JOEY:
 ok  

 hi, is molly here?

ROSS:
 yeah, come on in. molly?

  . 

ROSS:
 ok ...    no problem.

JOEY:
 it's like my favorite fairy tale come true!    princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! 

PHOEBE:
 ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and i start changing    the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.

 hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve    around their rats?

PHOEBE:
 well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.

 ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. what happens when they mate    and there are hundreds of them?

PHOEBE:
 mate? they're all brothers and sisters.

 yeah - not such a problem with rats. no, they're more of a "love    the one you're with" kind of animals.

PHOEBE:
 no.    are we gonna do? we have 7 rats. so what if each of them has 7 rats? and then    each of those have 7 rats? that's like ...    that's math i can't even do! what are we gonna do?

 well, i know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let    the box of rats ruin our lives.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, ok. i guess you're right. allright, so we should just give them away.    but to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. they're bob's    favorites. 

 it's gonna be ok.

PHOEBE:
 you must think i'm crazy.

 no, i think you're sweet.

PHOEBE:
 good. it's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.    i guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when i gave birth to    my brother's triplets and i had to give them up.    told you about that yet, have i? 

MONICA:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up?

MONICA:
 no way! you had your party, now i have mine! is everything alright?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.

MONICA:
 well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk gavin from    your office didn't show up 

RACHEL:
 mmm hmm.

 yeah, hey. 

MONICA:
 oh, we weren't talking about you. no, no way to recover.

RACHEL:
 no. 

 nice party.

RACHEL:
 well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at 

30?? god! oh, this party was lame ...

MONICA:
 

 look, i'll just give you this and go.

RACHEL:
 oh, you bought me a present! why?

 well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. there    are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. ok, i ... got you    the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.

RACHEL:
 aww. well, ok, well that's very nice. and you wrote a card  . "from gavin"

 i really mean it.

RACHEL:
 

 you don't mind? 

RACHEL:
 see, gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such    a hard time?

 i'm not sure.

RACHEL:
 well monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.

 i do have feelings for you.

RACHEL:
 you do?

 yes, i feel that you are a little annoying.

RACHEL:
 see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion    of you, you go and you ...    ending credits

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 

CHANDLER:
 

PHOEBE:
 listen, i think i've left something here.

CHANDLER:
 oh, well someone left this 

PHOEBE:
    my rat babies.

CHANDLER:
 oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know.

MONICA:
 ohmygod! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby! 

CHANDLER:
 hey!

ROSS:
 yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what  happened here last night?

CHANDLER:
 sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like  you! do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what  they did or didn't do ...i mean come on!!

ROSS:
 ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about?

CHANDLER:
 no!

ROSS:
 ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from  her office out on your balcony.

CHANDLER:
 our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica  we should put lights on our balcony. and she said"no, no. it's too cold,  nobody will go out there." and i said "maybe if we put some light out there they  will"

ROSS:
 right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel  kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were no lights !

CHANDLER:
 so are you gonna...talk to her?

ROSS:
 why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's  fine!

CHANDLER:
 you know when "that's fine" sounds true when someone yells it  and spits!

ROSS:
 no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care  but...at least she could have told me. you knowi...i've been putting my life  on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing  guys shebarely knows, then so will i ! very funny! ross is gay! ah!  ah!

CHANDLER:
 no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where  you're moving?

ROSS:
 i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now  there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.and then the other  day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

CHANDLER:
 dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!

ROSS:
 well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who  totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalpotluck dinner.

CHANDLER:
 why did i get married?!        

JOEY:
 hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken  tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks ishould have my eyebrows  waxed. is that weird for a guy?

PHOEBE:
 well it depends.

JOEY:
 on...?

PHOEBE:
 on how far along he's in the sex change process!

MONICA:
 no i totally disagree. no i think it's fine for a guy to do  something like that. such you an actor. not that you need to,your eyebrows  are...

JOEY:
 ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you're freaking me out!

PHOEBE:
 your knuckles are kinda hairy too...

JOEY:
 oh man! i have to get those done too?!

PHOEBE:
 wow! talking about high maintenance

JOEY:
 hey hey! you dye your hair!

PHOEBE:
 i'm a woman!

JOEY:
 arghhh! double standards!

PHOEBE:
 oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar  tonight?

MONICA:
 only if i don't have to get up and sing.

PHOEBE:
 but everybody sings. it's so much fun! last time this adorable  old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone  booed him off the stage. so funny.

MONICA:
 it's just, i'm not good at singing.

PHOEBE:
 oh! what's the matter? are you scared? you're afraid i'm a better  singer? you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing?

MONICA:
 no no, it's not working on me. wow! i must be growing up!

PHOEBE:
 ok fine! please come and support mike. you don't have to  sing.

MONICA:
 so i don't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass  judgments on others?

PHOEBE:
 while drinking...

MONICA:
 i'm there!

RACHEL:
 hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something  really stupid.

PHOEBE:
 well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out  there

RACHEL:
 no not that. i kissed gavin last night.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god.

MONICA:
 you kissed him?

RACHEL:
 yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony  and...

MONICA:
 wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed  that?

PHOEBE:
 it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping  paper.

MONICA:
 oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing?

RACHEL:
 you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me  and, oh and he gave me this scarf...

MONICA:
 i thought you hated him?

RACHEL:
 you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and  it turns out that line...is a scarf!

MONICA:
 so are you thinking of starting up something with this  guy?

RACHEL:
 i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you  know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don'tknow what to do  and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes.

MONICA:
 sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin,  and you definitely should talk to ross

RACHEL:
 or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...

PHOEBE:
 wow! five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss  a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!   

 hi

JOEY:
 hey. i'm here for my eyebrow appointment.

 name?

JOEY:
 chandler bing.

 ok. very good. have a seat right over here mr. bing and sonia  will be right with you.

JOEY:
 ok thanks. stuff

 i'll take care of it

JOEY:
 thanks. do you get a lot of guys in here?

 oh absolutely.

JOEY:
 oh good...

 are you looking to meet somebody?

JOEY:
 all right let's just do this.

 we'll get to the wax in a minute. first i want to tweeze some of  the strays, ok? this may sting just a little bit...

JOEY:
 please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my  face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right!just a little bit of shock  that's all but i'll be fine you can go again. i'm ok  dammit! woman!! how hoooow! 

CHANDLER:
 hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on  going?

ROSS:
 not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand  but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.

CHANDLER:
 well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i  mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,two  illegitimate children. the personal ad writes itself....

ROSS:
 that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again?

CHANDLER:
 what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!

ROSS:
 i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to  me

CHANDLER:
 maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just  an impulsive one-time birthday thing

ROSS:
 no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a  bar.

CHANDLER:
 did she go out with him?

ROSS:
 no. when he called, i...i threw the message away.

CHANDLER:
 ah! the high road...

ROSS:
 you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey  check out those two blondes over there!hey come with me!

CHANDLER:
 are you trying to get everybody divorced?

ROSS:
 you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the  two of us, like college, remember? you...you break theice with some kind of  jokes so that they know you're the funny one and i swoop in with some  interesting conversation, sothey'll see that i'm the brilliant, brooding,  sexy one...

CHANDLER:
 i thought i had to make the jokes!

ROSS:
 don't you have to be at work?

CHANDLER:
 oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend  ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. we only  need six more people for a human pyramid...swoop!! swoop!!

ROSS:
 hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the 

 "would you...would you  rather drown or be burnt alive?"

 sorry...we were just leaving

CHANDLER:
 we still got it!     

RACHEL:
 who is it?

 gavin! i brought you some soup.

RACHEL:
 why?

 i heard you were sick...

RACHEL:
 oh! right! yeah! hold on, i'll be just clean up in here a little  bit! hello gavin

 i missed you at work today. how are you feeling?

RACHEL:
 i a not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick

 oh! good! because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i  thought you called in sick to avoid me.

RACHEL:
 oh no no no

 so i had fun last night

RACHEL:
 so did i

 exactly how contagious is this thing you have? i mean is it a cold  for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?

RACHEL:
 it's just a cold

 do you have fever? let me see. hum...

RACHEL:
 what? what's the matter?

 what's ross doing to you on that picture?

RACHEL:
 oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be  funny.

 right. right. ross. so what's the deal with you guys? i don't want  to get in the middle of anything

RACHEL:
 oh you're not. you're not gonna get in the middle of anything,  don't worry about ross really, really.  oh! hide! that's ross! hide! hide!

 yeah! but you said not to worry about...

RACHEL:
 i lied! and i'm not sick! just stay behind the curtain!

 hi!

RACHEL:
 oh! molly! you're not ross.

 no i'm here to take emma to your mother's, remember?

RACHEL:
 right, right, yes!

 don't panic!

RACHEL:
 what?

 there is a man behind your curtain. i have a mace in my  purse.

RACHEL:
 no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my  business associate gavin. he's just being silly.gavin come out from behind  that curtain!

 hi! gavin! please to meet you. it was my idea to stand  there.

 hello! i just go and get emma.

RACHEL:
 ok.

 so hum...why did i have to hide?

RACHEL:
 i thought it was ross.

 so what if it was? i thought there was nothing going on between  you two...

RACHEL:
 there isn't. there is totally isn't.

 you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming  out of a chute for the first time. i used to be arodeo clown.

RACHEL:
 all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were  here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not inany relationship  but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus  there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...i don't know, i'm sorry,  i'm just all over the place.

 it's ok. i know it's probably not my place but can i give you a  piece of advice?

RACHEL:
 yes

 i think you should talk to ross about all this.

RACHEL:
 people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin

 don't be. it's just bad timing.

RACHEL:
 so seriously...rodeo clown?

 one of the best, ma'am, one of the best...     

PHOEBE:
 "no time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the  world...!" thank you! 

 oh she's my girlfriend. that's not just how we do it here. i got to  get a break and when we come back we've got kennethsinging "i touch  myself"...i'm not here to judge!

PHOEBE:
 hi hi...oh you have got to sing.

MONICA:
 no i told you i can't.

PHOEBE:
 but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice  voice.

MONICA:
 what have you heard me sing?

PHOEBE:
 all the time when you're cooking.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 yeah you're always singing "yummy yummy yummy, i've got love in  my tummy"

MONICA:
 yeah i do rock that one.

PHOEBE:
 ok so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up  there?

MONICA:
 just a little but...it's just so scary! i don't even know what i  would sing...

 well i've got a book around...

MONICA:
 "delta dawn"     

ROSS:
 hi! i could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace

 you already hit on me an hour ago

ROSS:
 right, so that's a firm "no". i cannot believe this, i just keep  striking out.

CHANDLER:
 i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate,  you're asking women how they want to be killed

ROSS:
 this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the  one she wants and i'm gonna die alone.

CHANDLER:
 by drowning or...?!

 why would he break up with me?

 i don't know sweetie.

 all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back.  i mean, am i so unlovable?

CHANDLER:
 well...

ROSS:
 i know!        

 all right, that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of  "i touch myself". coming up next we've got monicasinging "delta  dawn".

MONICA:
 wait wait! i can't sing in front of all these people.

PHOEBE:
 just pretend they're not even here! it's ok monica, when that  spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.

MONICA:
 hi! i'm monica and i'm gonna be singing "delta dawn""delta  dawn, what's that flower you have on? could it be a faded rose from days gone  by? ..."

PHOEBE:
 can you totally see through her shirt ?

 like an x-ray. bad day not to wear a bra.

MONICA:
 "to take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"     

JOEY:
 hey, i need your help.

CHANDLER:
 wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley  judd?

JOEY:
 look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my  eyebrows shaped

CHANDLER:
 i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!

JOEY:
 you may be a sissy but i'll still  right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they  dont match!

CHANDLER:
 its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!

JOEY:
 all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic  marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one soi dont look stupid for my  pictures.

CHANDLER:
 ok. first of all, this is green!

JOEY:
 what the hell am i supposed to do!

CHANDLER:
 all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you  will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you.

JOEY:
 what, what.

CHANDLER:
 ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the  lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mineby plucking the eyebrows  of my father and his business partners.

JOEY:
 oh my god!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i guess you dont need my help victor  victoria!

JOEY:
 ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help,  but chandler i dont know if i can take anymoreplucking. it hurts so  bad!

CHANDLER:
 oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my  gentle self-loathing touch.     

MONICA:
 "take me to the mansion in the sky-y". i am sorry, the song is  over. did you see me out there?

PHOEBE:
 every little bit of you!

MONICA:
 i cant believe i did this. i cant believe i'm singing for the  people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear thatone shouting look at those  tips! i mean, did i really help you get a lot of tips?

 sure.

PHOEBE:
 mon', not that you didnt sound good, but...

MONICA:
 good? didnt you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for  making me do this. thats is the best gift ever.

 also a good gift? underwear.     

 thank you so much for letting me do this. public bathrooms  freak me out, i can't even pee, let alone doanything else.

ROSS:
 but, whats great is that you dont mind talking about it.

 its so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with  me, because its like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.

ROSS:
 uh-ah!

 no dont worry, this is not some rebound thing. i am totally  over eric.

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
 oh, hey! hi, there you are, ive been looking for you  everywhere!

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am.

RACHEL:
 listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock.  so i was hoping you and i could have achance to kind of talk somebody  here?

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, yeah thats michelle.

RACHEL:
 who?

ROSS:
 oh, just this woman ive been seeing.

RACHEL:
 youve being seeing someone?

ROSS:
 yeah, didnt i mention that? yeah, i mean, we havent being going  out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. i-i  mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. i thought it  wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.

 what are you taking amoxicillin for?

ROSS:
 how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look  through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, thatsmy roommate, rachel.

RACHEL:
 hi, and i am also emmas mother.

 ah, who is emma?

ROSS:
 i told you about my daughter.

 this is your daughter? i can be your new mummy!     

CHANDLER:
 and done!

JOEY:
 oh my god! i didnt feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a  job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the  saloon

CHANDLER:
 thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look  great! how you doing!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little  worried i was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to  be a little piece of chocolate.

JOEY:
 thank you so much.

CHANDLER:
 no problem.

JOEY:
 listen thats a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some  manly make up for it.

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 comb my eyelashes.     

MONICA:
 ok, for my next song i think ill sing something a little more  upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointersisters i am so excited. and  make it bouncy!

PHOEBE:
 oh youll probably take care of that on your hands.

CHANDLER:
 i am sorry i am late. youll understand when youll see  joey.

MONICA:
 honey, youre just in time, im about to sing another  song!

CHANDLER:
 really? in front of all this people?

MONICA:
 and they love me!

CHANDLER:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 yes, she gives the people what they want.

MONICA:
 all right, watch!

MONICA:
 "tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll  put all other things aside. give in thistime and show me some  affection..."

CHANDLER:
 are those my wifes nipples?

PHOEBE:
 oh? isnt that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have  let her go up again.

CHANDLER:
 i gotta stop this.

MONICA:
 oh, who cares, they still love me! "i am so excited..."

CHANDLER:
 you, touching yourself, out!     

RACHEL:
 wow. she does that a lot!

 ross, you didnt tell me you were a doctor!

RACHEL:
 what, what, wait a minute! you havent even told her you were a  doctor, yet? how long have you known her, likean hour?

 actually about an hour and a half.

ROSS:
 i told you it wasnt long, but there is an amazing connection  between us.

 you feel that too? oh, i thought that was just me!

ROSS:
 are you kidding?

 hey, do you want to go away this weekend?

ROSS:
 well see.

RACHEL:
 ok, ross, whats going on here, are we just bringing strange  women back to the apartment now?

ROSS:
 i dont know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?

RACHEL:
 how do you know about that?

ROSS:
 through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to  sleep...

 emma.

ROSS:
 when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a  guy you know, for what? a week?

RACHEL:
 oh, thats what this is all about? did you bring her up here to  get back at me?

 no, actually, see i had to pee, cause i cant use public  bathrooms because the doodie parasites.

ROSS:
 ok, michelle, its time to go.

 well, call me!

ROSS:
 ok.

 no, wait, you dont have my phone number!

ROSS:
 you know, if its meant to be, ill guess it. bye, bye.

RACHEL:
 score.

ROSS:
 oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we  could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.

RACHEL:
 oh god, i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this.  it was one kiss, one guy, one time!

ROSS:
 oh, really!

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 oh, really!

RACHEL:
 oh yeah.

ROSS:
 what about the guy from the bar?

RACHEL:
 what? who?

ROSS:
 the guy you gave your number to.

RACHEL:
 whoa, how do you know about that?

ROSS:
 because he called here looking for you. so dont tell me  this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? youve been  out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. and you didnt even  have the courtesy to tell me.

RACHEL:
 why didnt i get that message?

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 from the guy in the bar, why didnt i get that message?

ROSS:
 because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you  not look there?

RACHEL:
 ross?

ROSS:
 i never gave it to you.

RACHEL:
 why?

ROSS:
 i dont know.

RACHEL:
 oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to  decide what messages i should or should not get?

ROSS:
 who am i?

RACHEL:
 yes.

ROSS:
 i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars  meeting guys!

RACHEL:
 oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in  here hoping to have a mature conversation with youabout us! but i cant do  that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my  apartment!

ROSS:
 none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! thats not the  point. ok? the point is you...you are the onewho moved on and didnt tell  anyone!

RACHEL:
 oh, ross, this is just so messed up! whats wrong with us? you  know when people hear about our situation theyalways ask, what, you live  together but youre not a couple? and you have a baby, isnt that weird?» and i  say no.you know what, its not, because it works for us!» but you know this  doesnt work. in fact this is the opposite of working!

ROSS:
 uh, clearly.

RACHEL:
 and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as  long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,just doesnt make sense  anymore.

ROSS:
 yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do?     

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi. can emma and i live here for a while?

JOEY:
 ha, oh, of course.

RACHEL:
 thank you.

JOEY:
 your eyebrows look weird.     

JOEY:
 morning, roomie!

RACHEL:
 hey! you remembered to put clothes on this morning.

JOEY:
 fifth day's a charm.

RACHEL:
 oh, joey, it's so great to be back here. i gotta tell you, you're       making it so easy on me and emma.

JOEY:
 hey, it's great having you back. you know, stay as long as you want,       and when does she stop crying all night? 

ROSS:
 hey, you're not naked! so hey, rach, when will we expect to see you       tonight?

RACHEL:
 well, i'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's       in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually fall back to sleep,       so...

JOEY:
 she's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did       last night.

RACHEL:
 bye! 

ROSS:
 bye! hey, i hope emma isn't making it too hard on you.

JOEY:
 no, hey, it's been great.

ROSS:
 yeah?

JOEY:
 yeah. and look, i just want you to know that with rachel staying       here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?       and even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using       a breast pump...

ROSS:
 yeah, that'll do it.

JOEY:
 wow! so, how are you?

ROSS:
 i'm, i'm okay. 

JOEY:
 really?

ROSS:
 sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have       worked out? of course. you know, i'm disappointed, but it's not like it's       a divorce.

JOEY:
 well, actually it...

ROSS:
 no, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! anyway, i think rachel       and i need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing       other people.

JOEY:
 wow, really?

ROSS:
 yeah, sure, why not? in fact, if you know anyone that would be good       for me...

JOEY:
 sure, i know lots of girls. 

ROSS:
 yeah? any names come to mind?

JOEY:
 ooh, names? opening credits.  

PHOEBE:
 hey.

JOEY:
 hey. i was just gonna get something to eat. you want something?

PHOEBE:
 what you got? joey        strained carrots... ooh! strained plums. we haven't tried that yet.

PHOEBE:
 goodie! thanks. so, how is it living with rachel again? i mean, apart       from the great food.

JOEY:
 i'm fine, i'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with       her and ross. you know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god, rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too.

JOEY:
 why are they doing this?

PHOEBE:
 i don't know. they're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.

JOEY:
 you know what's crazy? these jars. what is it, like two bites in       here?

PHOEBE:
 i just wish they'd realise they should be together.

JOEY:
 i know, i know. and when they moved back in together, i figured y'know,       that's where things were headed.

PHOEBE:
 i know. they should be a family. they should get married and have       more children.

JOEY:
 yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. i may not have       kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.

PHOEBE:
 you know what? maybe once they start dating, and they see what's       out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.

JOEY:
 yeah, because it is slim pickings. i had this date last night: yuck!       but we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.

PHOEBE:
 so, what are we gonna do? are we just gonna go ahead and set them       up with people?

JOEY:
 i know; that just pushes them further and further apart. 

PHOEBE:
 yeah.        up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.

JOEY:
 ooh, that's a great plan! 

PHOEBE:
 yeah, you know what the best part of it is? i get to do my "plan-laugh."   

JOEY:
 shhh! not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...    

RACHEL:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?

CHANDLER:
 see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married?       i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you'll       excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries.

RACHEL:
 i was just asking 'cause i need someone to watch emma tonight.

MONICA:
 sure, we'll do that. what are you up to?

RACHEL:
 well, phoebe set me up on a date. 

MONICA:
 oh my god.

CHANDLER:
 wow.

RACHEL:
 why? what's the big deal?

MONICA:
 just figured, 'cause you and ross are...

RACHEL:
 what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set.

CHANDLER:
 well, i think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? i       mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood!

MONICA:
 you want a job? turn off "oprah," and send out a resume!

RACHEL:
 so i'll bring her by around seven? is that okay?

MONICA:
 oh, it's perfect.

RACHEL:
 oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! she's at such a cute age.       oh, a couple things. now that she's eating solid food, she poops around       the clock. and watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. and       oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody       murder, but ah... thanks, you guys. have fun! chandler   

PHOEBE:
 ooh, joey. 

JOEY:
 hey.

PHOEBE:
 hey. i'm so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight. 

JOEY:
 all right! who is he?

PHOEBE:
 well, it's this guy i used to massage. and by massage, i mean hold       down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me. joey        for ross.

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah. 

JOEY:
 she's this really boring woman. she's a teacher! 

PHOEBE:
 a teacher?

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... and oh,       oh, she loves puzzles. huh? come on, who loves puzzles?

PHOEBE:
 well, ross does. what... you're - you're ruining the plan! joey,       you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! 

JOEY:
 oh my god, you're right! 

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 she even reads for pleasure!

PHOEBE:
 how do you even know a woman like that?

JOEY:
 what? i'm not allowed to know smart women? 

PHOEBE:
 joey.

JOEY:
 i met her at the library. i went in to pee.

PHOEBE:
 so now what do we do?

JOEY:
 well, okay, i'll - i'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,       and find him somebody else.

PHOEBE:
 what if we don't find him somebody else? we'll just tell her the       date's off, but we don't tell ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets       stood up!

JOEY:
 ooh...i hear that's bad. 

PHOEBE:
 ooh, so this is great! rachel's gonna have a terrible date, ross       gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.

JOEY:
 ah, yes, the plan!  

PHOEBE:
 it's not santa's plan. no, it's...  

JOEY:
 yeah, you know, it's not that fun.

PHOEBE:
 no, i think we killed it.  

CHANDLER:
 emma? emma? look at me! well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while.  

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it's okay, it's okay. i didn't go.       don't cry, it's just a bit! i'm your uncle chandler; funny is all i have! 

MONICA:
 okay, just so you know, i'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until       the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.

CHANDLER:
 i don't do that. 

CHANDLER:
 i'll try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth?

MONICA:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 today is the sixth.

MONICA:
 no, it's not. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, it's also 2003.

MONICA:
 oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may be done ovulating! i may have       also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.

CHANDLER:
 it's okay. go take the test and see if we're okay.

MONICA:
 okay.  

CHANDLER:
 tough crib.

MONICA:
 hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? there's only one here.

CHANDLER:
 i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times.

MONICA:
 chandler!

CHANDLER:
 i am not working. there's not much to do around here!  

ROSS:
 excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? someone average height,       dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?

 uh, there's a drunk chinese guy.

ROSS:
 well, if i'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.

 can i get you another glass of wine? 

ROSS:
 nah, i don't know if i should. i don't wanna be drunk when i go home       alone.

 got stood up, huh?

ROSS:
 yeah, it's no big deal. it's just a blind date.

 are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?

ROSS:
 no!    

MONICA:
 we're okay. i'm still ovulating.

CHANDLER:
 oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, i am not. 

MONICA:
 so, let's do this.

CHANDLER:
 i - i don't think i can.

MONICA:
 come on. i know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.

CHANDLER:
 because of emma.

MONICA:
 oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here. oh, you're       right, we can't do this. we can't leave her alone.

CHANDLER:
 sorry.

MONICA:
 unless... maybe we do it here. i mean, how much can she even be aware       of at this age?

CHANDLER:
 well, she's aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start...       canoodling in it.

MONICA:
 canoodling?

CHANDLER:
 well, i can't say "hump" or "screw" in front       of the b-a-b-y.

MONICA:
 i don't know. i mean, i guess having sex in front of a baby isn't       so...

CHANDLER:
 horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for?

MONICA:
 i guess you're right.

CHANDLER:
 you guess i'm right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you       wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through       the window.

MONICA:
 but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?        together with her date, steve. steve is the stoned restaurateur from 115 

RACHEL:
 wow, everything looks so good! i think i'm gonna have the chicken. steve 

RACHEL:
 oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. thank you.

 i'm kind of funny looking. 

RACHEL:
 what?

 oh, come on, you're way out of my league. everybody in here knows       it. bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with       him? he must be rich!" well, i'm not!  rachel        excited about that chicken.

 i'm not funny either. so, if you were thinking, "well, he's       not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... that ain't       gonna happen.

RACHEL:
 well, come on, steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. hey, now       wait a minute. phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.       that's impressive.

 i lost it. to drugs.  

 i silk-screen t-shirts now.

RACHEL:
 really? what's that like?

 it's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. that's       right. i have no money, i'm not funny, i live in a studio apartment with       two other guys, and i'm pretty sure i'm infertile. rachel        that you like about yourself. 

 i do like my hair.

RACHEL:
 really?   

PHOEBE:
 hello? 

RACHEL:
 phoebe, it's me. i'm going to hunt you down and kill you!

PHOEBE:
 hey, rach!

RACHEL:
 this is the worst date ever. how could you set me up with this creep?

PHOEBE:
 you know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. 

RACHEL:
 i don't care! this guy is a nightmare!

PHOEBE:
 oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.

RACHEL:
 he's not stoned.

PHOEBE:
 did he go out for a cigarette? 

RACHEL:
 yeah, four times.

PHOEBE:
 my dear, sweet rach.  phoebe        time, and ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.

JOEY:
 oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.

PHOEBE:
 by the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny       mexico.         asleep in her playpen, and chandler has fallen asleep right next to her 

MONICA:
 she's asleep. chandler?  

MONICA:
 what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 emma was doing it!

MONICA:
 she's asleep.

CHANDLER:
 ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...

MONICA:
 yes, but we have to be fast. chandler  monica   

JOEY:
 hello?  

JOEY:
 emma? hey! hi! 

JOEY:
 how are ya? how are ya? where are your babysitters, huh? why's the       bedroom door closed?  

JOEY:
 you can't have s-e-x, when you're taking care of the b-a-b-i-e!   

 i've got bad news. the chinese guy left. 

ROSS:
 eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.

 look; you got stood up, who cares? we're gonna show you a good time.       just sit and relax. in fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on       the house.

ROSS:
 wow, free crab cakes. well, that's nice. although i was hoping to       have sex tonight.

 ooh...  

ROSS:
 just the crab cakes. 

 what are you       doing? are you trying to get him to stay? because you can't do that.

 just get out of here, okay?

ROSS:
 what's - what's going on?

 eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. we have a bet on       how long it'll take before you give up and go home.

ROSS:
 what? you - you're making money off my misery?

 well, if you stay till 9:20, i am.

ROSS:
 this is unbelievable. i - i have never been so insulted in my life.       now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, i'll be on my way.  

MONICA:
 well, that was weird. you were loud, and i was fast.

CHANDLER:
 i think we may have really done it this time.

MONICA:
 oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.

CHANDLER:
 you may wanna get some more of those too. 

CHANDLER:
 where's emma?

MONICA:
 oh my god, where's emma? where's emma?

CHANDLER:
 don't ask me, i was in there canoodling you!

MONICA:
 okay, okay, i'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma.       you go look across the hall, and i'll call her cell.

CHANDLER:
 okay. 

MONICA:
 hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,       we're giving a baby back to rachel.   steve        think i'm so pathetic.

RACHEL:
 no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry.

 really? 

RACHEL:
 don't touch my coat! 

RACHEL:
 oh, sorry, it's my phone. hello? monica 

RACHEL:
 oh my god, this is the worst date ever!  rachel        that this was going well? 

MONICA:
 hey, did you stop by here?

RACHEL:
 no.

MONICA:
 oh my god, then... 

MONICA:
 oh, thank god! emma, there you are!

RACHEL:
 what? what do you mean, "there you are"? where was she?

MONICA:
 oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." she just  she loves       it when i'm dramatic.  monica 

JOEY:
 because you two were having sex!

MONICA:
 no, we weren't!

JOEY:
 don't you lie to me! i could tell by chandler's hair.        you are so lazy. can't you get on top for once?

CHANDLER:
 all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's       ovulating.

JOEY:
 hey! it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in       the next room. i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this.  

CHANDLER:
 no, no, no.

MONICA:
 no, please don't. please, joey. she will kill us!

JOEY:
 hey, i gotta! unless...

MONICA:
 unless what?

JOEY:
 unless you name your firstborn child joey.

CHANDLER:
 what? why?

JOEY:
 hey, i may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family       name.

CHANDLER:
 your family name is tribbiani.

JOEY:
    

RACHEL:
 well, uh...

 look, i think i know the answer to this question, but... would you       like to make love to me?

RACHEL:
 really, really not.

 eh, it's just as well. doesn't work anyway.

RACHEL:
 all right, well that's good to know. good night, steve.        sitting on the couch, eating crab cakes. she takes off her coat while groaning 

ROSS:
 hey, what's wrong?

RACHEL:
 i just had a rough night.

ROSS:
 oh. crab cake?

RACHEL:
 eww!

ROSS:
 well, what happened?

RACHEL:
 oh, well, i...it's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...

ROSS:
 monica told me you had a blind date.

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 i did, too.

RACHEL:
 oh.

ROSS:
 but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?

RACHEL:
 oh, oh no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left?

ROSS:
 why does everyone keep saying that?

RACHEL:
 well, if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date hadn't shown       up.

ROSS:
 that bad?

RACHEL:
 well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be       appropriate to give me this.  

ROSS:
 female body inspector? what size is that?  

PHOEBE:
 now, wait a minute. so, they're gonna name their first child joey?

JOEY:
 uh-huh.

PHOEBE:
 how - how do i get them to name the next one after me?

JOEY:
 it's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.

PHOEBE:
 oh, so they owe me like, three phoebes. 

PHOEBE:
 oh my god! look, it's ross and rachel. oh, the plan is working. 

PHOEBE:
 don't, don't do the plan-laugh. 

ROSS:
 the first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.

RACHEL:
 oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would       set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you       up on a date that didn't even show.

ROSS:
 wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? i mean, that's       just stupid. 

JOEY:
 we're geniuses! yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really       bonding.

PHOEBE:
 oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, they see us! oh, they, they look mad. oh, they figured it out.       they're coming this way. run!

JOEY:
 where?

PHOEBE:
 mexico!   end credits.  

JOEY:
 can you believe they're still not here?

ROSS:
 i know. a double blind date, and we both get stood up. what are the       chances?

JOEY:
 i know, i'm so bummed. can we have our free crab cakes now?

 what?

JOEY:
 we've been stood up. 

 guys, give it a rest. nobody's betting on you tonight. although we       do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.  

CHANDLER:
  

JOEY:
 uh, ah, monica's pregnant?! 

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 what's your news? 

CHANDLER:
 thank you. i got a job in advertising.  

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
 actually, it pays nothing. it's an internship. 

JOEY:
 oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'.  

CHANDLER:
 right. so, it'll be the same except less sex with you.  

ROSS:
 so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? 

CHANDLER:
 well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. 

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating    

CHANDLER:
    

ROSS:
 you know, if i didn't already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising. 

MONICA:
 ross, you did not come up with "got milk?" 

ROSS:
 yes, i did, i did!   opening credits   

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 hey! 

JOEY:
 where's chandler? i wanna wish him good luck on his first day.  

MONICA:
 he just left. 

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
  

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
  

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 what is she talking about? 

JOEY:
 i don't know, but it sounds great.  

RACHEL:
 your agent called. you got that audition. 

JOEY:
 with lennart haze? 

RACHEL:
 yes. 

JOEY:
 oh my god, that is great! that is *** for a play on broadway and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time. 

MONICA:
 is it a good play? 

JOEY:
 well, it must be, because i read and i didn't understand a singe word.  

RACHEL:
 yeah, and lennart haze is starring in it 

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah, and directing. 

MONICA:
  

RACHEL:
  

MONICA:
 no, but i saw the previews. they played it right before jackass. 

  

JOEY:
 yeah, he's done some amazing works. 

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah. oh, i loved him in those cell phone commercials.  

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 hey! maybe the monkey will be at the audition! 

JOEY:
     

CHANDLER:
  

 can i get you a cup of coffee, sir? 

CHANDLER:
 oh, no, no, i'm an intern, just like you guys except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that i can rent a car. 

 seriously, you're an intern? 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom. 

  

CHANDLER:
 right. look, i know i'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope    

CHANDLER:
 the comedian? uso?! 

       

 this is joey tribbiani. joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is lennart haze.    

JOEY:
 it is so amazing to meet you.  

 well, i've i've been blessed with a a lot of great roles.  

JOEY:
 tell me about it! "unlimited nights and weekends!"  

 you making fun of me? because i am not a sell-out.  

JOEY:
 no, i-i-i wasn't making fun of you, honestly, i-i think you were great in those commercials.  

 really? 

JOEY:
 yeah. 

 well, i do bring a certain credibility to the role. 

JOEY:
  

 peeeeeooooooooch  

JOEY:
 wow! 

 so, shall we read? 

JOEY:
 oh, yah, sure. 

 top of act two. this is my entrance. you got it?    

 "what the hell are you still doing here"?   

JOEY:
 err, "i think you know".  

 "bastard"! 

JOEY:
 "i am what you made me. you know what? i could go right now." 

 "go, go!" 

JOEY:
 "i can't. oh, i want to, long pause, but i can't." 

 i'm sorry, sorry. you're not supposed to say "long pause" 

JOEY:
  

 no. thank you so much for coming in. we appreciate it, thank you.  

JOEY:
 ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? i could do it with an accent, you know, southern  

    

 joey, hang on for a second. lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?   

 you, you gotta be kidding. see, h-he, he can't act.    

 hey! i-i-i don't care if he's hot, you know. if you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.    

JOEY:
  

 well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. ready? 

JOEY:
 yeah. 

 uhm, you're in your head. you-you're thinking way too much.  

JOEY:
 i really doubt that.  

    

JOEY:
     

PHOEBE:
 hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? 

ROSS:
 oh, i can't. i've got a date with that waitress, katy, yeah, i know we've been only going out like twice, but i have a really good feeling about her.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, i hear divorce bells.    

 alright. just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.  

ROSS:
  

 i have a gun  

ROSS:
 o-ok. just relax, phoene, just stay calm.    

 alright, lady, now give me your purse! 

PHOEBE:
 no. 

ROSS:
    

PHOEBE:
 lowell, is that you? 

 phoebe?  

PHOEBE:
    

PHOEBE:
  

 ross, nice to meet you.  

ROSS:
 yeah, a real pleasure. 

PHOEBE:
 ah, it's been so long, so long.  

 ough, i know, but i quit smoking! 

PHOEBE:
 good for you!  

 so you look like you're doing really well! i guess you're mugging days are behind you? 

PHOEBE:
 ouh  

ROSS:
  

PHOEBE:
 excuse me, ross, old friends catching up    

MONICA:
 hey, how did the audition go?  

JOEY:
 well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, lennart haze did not like me.  

MONICA:
 what happened? 

JOEY:
 well, he said i wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical. oh, and he said that i should think less. 

MONICA:
 so far so good!  

CHANDLER:
  

MONICA:
  

CHANDLER:
 i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them. 

MONICA:
 so you're a little older. try to look at the positive: you have all this life experience. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, but i don't think life experience with these.  

JOEY:
 wooooooooow  

MONICA:
 what are they?  

CHANDLER:
 they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. 

JOEY:
  

CHANDLER:
 what am i supposed to do with these? 

MONICA:
 ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time. 

CHANDLER:
 well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and i think i heard somebody say "slorps".  

MONICA:
 okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?  

CHANDLER:
 no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.  

JOEY:
 hey, that'd work on me! why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords?     

 hey, hey! 

ROSS:
 hey, you'll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged! 

MONICA:
 you okay?! 

ROSS:
  

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us.  

ROSS:
 you wanna know how she knew him?  

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 well, i'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i 

MONICA:
  

PHOEBE:
 well, ok, i wasn't rich like you guys, ok, i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer 

MONICA:
 you're mother killed herself! 

PHOEBE:
 she was a drug dealer! 

ROSS:
 well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because  

PHOEBE:
  

MONICA:
 well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, ross. 

PHOEBE:
 why? 

MONICA:
 well, ross was mugged as a kid. 

PHOEBE:
  

ROSS:
 yeah, it was pretty traumatic. i was outside st. marc's comics you know, i-i-i was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-  

MONICA:
  

ROSS:
 anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone  

PHOEBE:
  

ROSS:
 i know! and-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book: "science boy" 

MONICA:
 oh yeah! what was his superpower again? 

ROSS:
 a superhuman thirst for knowledge. 

MONICA:
 that's it.  

ROSS:
 well, i-i better get to class  

PHOEBE:
 no actually, you might wanna stay away from jane street that's where stabby joe works.    

PHOEBE:
 okay, i think we have a problem here.  

MONICA:
 what? 

PHOEBE:
 well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marc's comics.  

MONICA:
 yeah? 

PHOEBE:
 well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.  

MONICA:
 so? 

PHOEBE:
 well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- 

 "geology rocks!"  

MONICA:
 oh my god! 

PHOEBE:
 i know i mugged ross!     

 you're late! 

JOEY:
  

 no, lennart doesn't wait! 

JOEY:
 but i'm bursting with u-hu! 

  

JOEY:
 actually, i really need 

  

JOEY:
 yes ahahaaa  

 ready? "what the hell are you still doing here?" 

JOEY:
  

 "oh, you sick bastard!" 

JOEY:
 "i am what you made me! you know what?" 

 "what?" 

JOEY:
 "i could go right now."  

 "then go, go!" 

JOEY:
  

 cut! that was good.  

JOEY:
  

 yes. plus what you've got that i don't know what you've got going this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that i couldn't've even imagined. wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but  you know what?  more, more. can you do that? 

JOEY:
 sure, yeah. i don't have time to say thank you because i really gotta go.  

     

MONICA:
 hey! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

MONICA:
 what are you doing? 

CHANDLER:
 putting on the sneakers thought i'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything 

RACHEL:
 oh, anything yet? 

CHANDLER:
 yes, how's this: they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!   

JOEY:
  

 hey!    

JOEY:
 probably wanna know what i'm doing? 

MONICA:
 no, that seems about right. 

JOEY:
 yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. i got a call-back, so i'm drinking everything. oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great! 

RACHEL:
 joey, that was formula. 

JOEY:
 we gotta get more of that.  

CHANDLER:
  

RACHEL:
 okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph.  

CHANDLER:
 alright    

CHANDLER:
     

PHOEBE:
  

ROSS:
 hey! 

PHOEBE:
 hey, how was class? 

ROSS:
 no one ever asked me that, what's wrong?  

PHOEBE:
 nothing, i really wanna know. 

ROSS:
 oh  

PHOEBE:
  

ROSS:
  

PHOEBE:
 you don't have to lie anymore, ross, i know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. 

ROSS:
 no, it wasn't. 

PHOEBE:
 yes, it was.  

ROSS:
 no, it wasn't. you don't think i would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old 

PHOEBE:
  

ROSS:
  

PHOEBE:
  

ROSS:
 it's not the best! 

PHOEBE:
 i know, i'm sorry, please forgive me. i don't know what to say 

ROSS:
  

PHOEBE:
 really? even more humiliating than 

ROSS:
       

  and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other! 

  

CHANDLER:
 okay  

  

CHANDLER:
 a-huh. so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "not suitable for adults!"  

 chandler, that's great!  

CHANDLER:
 oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me  

 you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's.  

CHANDLER:
  

 that is great. good work!  chandler. thank you.  

 see all of you tomorrow.    

CHANDLER:
 the cold weather hurts my hip!    

PHOEBE:
 hey, ross!  

ROSS:
 sure, go ahead. whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.  

PHOEBE:
 i just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting.    

ROSS:
  

PHOEBE:
 look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke.  

ROSS:
 oh my god.  

PHOEBE:
 i can't say, i just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day.  

ROSS:
 you really thought "science boy" was worth saving!  

PHOEBE:
 yeah but you should know, i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.  

ROSS:
 still this is amazing oh my god, thank you, phoebe.  

PHOEBE:
 you're welcome. and thank you for "science boy". i learned a lot from him  

ROSS:
 you're welcome.     

JOEY:
  

 "i-i-i can't tell you somethin' i don't know." 

JOEY:
 "you know!" 

 "i don't know!" 

JOEY:
 "i need an answer now!"  

 "alright, here, you want an answer the answer is"   

JOEY:
  

 "she never loved me, she only loved you." 

JOEY:
 "you knew this all along and you never told me? you never told me? i can never forgive you, i can never forgive myself, i have nothing to live for  bang  end scene!" 

 absolutely amazing!  

JOEY:
  

 wa-wa-wa-wait! congratulations! you did it! you did it!     closing credits   

MONICA:
 wow, that's a big cable bill! huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a saturday afternoon?!  

ROSS:
  

MONICA:
  that she was the huge guy that mugged you? yah.  

ROSS:
 i see. you didn't happen to tell 

MONICA:
  everybody we know? yeah. 

CHANDLER:
 did you see our bank statement? can this be right?

MONICA:
 i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since   i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened to all   our money?

CHANDLER:
 i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron.

MONICA:
 i guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than   we're bringing in.

CHANDLER:
 maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.

MONICA:
 oh, but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask   you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...   finding gold.

CHANDLER:
 you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal   out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next   month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's   refrigerator for a change. you're chef... what can you make out of backing   soda and beer?

MONICA:
 ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.

CHANDLER:
 no! we're not borrowing money.

MONICA:
 why not?

CHANDLER:
 because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing   my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool   house... but the other thing was never borrow money.

MONICA:
 wow! i had no idea you had this much pride.

CHANDLER:
 that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through   this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. opening credits  

 i'm gonna go. 

PHOEBE:
 why??

 i haven't been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more   clothes.

PHOEBE:
 oh...you don't have to go, i have something that will fit you.

 i put that tube top on as a joke.

PHOEBE:
 i want you to stay.

 i want to stay too but i've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers   as i can..

PHOEBE:
 why don't you turn them inside ou...

 done it.    of hours.

PHOEBE:
 i'll miss you.

 me too.    what? i just realised something. i don't wanna go home.

PHOEBE:
 great! ok...i'll go get the tube top.

 no, no! what i mean is, i hate going back to my apartment now... and   partly because i live above a known crack den but... mostly because when i'm   there, it's just, i really miss you. so.. do you want to move in together?

PHOEBE:
 wow, mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say "hell   yeah!"

 so we're doing it?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! let's do it! let's live together!   oh god, we're really going to move in together!

 yeah!

PHOEBE:
 i've always wanted to live with a guy. "pick up your socks!" "put   down the toilet seat!" "no! we're not having sex anymore!" it's   gonna be fun! 

MONICA:
 hey joey!

JOEY:
 hey!

MONICA:
 listen...i need to know that what i'm about to ask you, will never   get back to chandler. 

JOEY:
 i'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself. chandler is   my best friend, it would be wrong. good...

MONICA:
    not what i'm here to talk to you about. i need to borrow some money.

JOEY:
 aww, i don't know monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always   a mistake.

MONICA:
 but chandler lent you money!

JOEY:
 and i think he would tell you it was a mistake.

MONICA:
 come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.

JOEY:
 oh...how much?

MONICA:
 two thousand dollars?

JOEY:
 two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap opera star!?

MONICA:
 yeah...

JOEY:
 that's right i am! 

RACHEL:
 hi you guys!

 hey!

JOEY:
 oo...what's in the bag?

RACHEL:
 oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this   place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment.

JOEY:
 oh...baby-proofing... why is this such a big deal now? y'know, when   i was a kid it was like.. "whoops! joey fell down the stairs!" or   er.. "whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!" huh!

MONICA:
 anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?

RACHEL:
 no. i was just going to do this myself. 

JOEY:
 you're gonna do it?

RACHEL:
 yeah, why? you don't think a woman can do this?

JOEY:
 oh, women can. you can't.

RACHEL:
 monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?

MONICA:
 you're a pig. and you can't do this.

RACHEL:
 wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!

JOEY:
 the hardware store is right down the street.

RACHEL:
 there is a hardware store right down the street?  

PHOEBE:
 hey you guys! ok, we've got great news.

 phoebe and i are moving in together.

 congratulations!/good for you!/great!

PHOEBE:
 i know it's so exciting! you know i've never lived with a guy before.

MONICA:
 well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal   your makeup. unless they're playing "this is what my sister would look   like" 

CHANDLER:
 yeah.... she's not so cute.

 i'm gonna go to the bathroom.

PHOEBE:
 okay, well you put down the toilet seat.

 yes dear.

MONICA:
 is that a bit you guys do?

PHOEBE:
 uh huh...we're playing you two.

MONICA:
 we don't do that! tell her we don't do that!

CHANDLER:
 yes dear.

ROSS:
 i can't believe you guys are moving in together. that's, that's great!   i mean...i'm happy for you guys..

MONICA:
 i hear wedding bells.

PHOEBE:
 monica slow down! ok? i'm just excited to be living with him. you   know i mean, i don't know, can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah.   y'know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that   highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house   in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send   sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do.

ROSS:
 phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional.

PHOEBE:
 i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a   soccer mom!

 you ready to go?

PHOEBE:
 yeah! you bet roomy!

MONICA:
 don't you mean..groomy?

 what are you talking about?

PHOEBE:
 oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have   us picking out china patterns.  

PHOEBE:
 china patterns!!!!! 

RACHEL:
 this is easy...can't do this!   oh! wow! seriously i can't do this.  

CHANDLER:
 hey joe!

JOEY:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything   about it.

JOEY:
 i thought you didn't have secrets from monica.

CHANDLER:
 and that would have made the official party line.    and i are having a little financial trouble.

JOEY:
 yeah, i know.

CHANDLER:
 what? what do you mean you know?

JOEY:
 err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you're not working and   the economy is bad.

CHANDLER:
 oh! right.

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 anyway, err... i need to borrow some money.

JOEY:
 oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars?

CHANDLER:
 yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that!  

JOEY:
 err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much your   rent is. 

CHANDLER:
 oh ok.

JOEY:
  chandler       did monica borrow money from you?

JOEY:
 err... kind of.

CHANDLER:
 i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?

JOEY:
 oh no no no no no... it wasn't... it wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her.

CHANDLER:
 what?

JOEY:
 something personal.

CHANDLER:
 what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she   wouldn't tell me about? 

 excuse me.

JOEY:
 boob job.

MONICA:
 i don't want her to get a boob job! that's crazy!

JOEY:
 well it's...it's not that crazy okay? making them smaller, that would   be crazy. 

 well hey, i wanna ask you about monica's little "groomy" joke.

PHOEBE:
 oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it's   a play on the word roomy.

 i get the joke. sophisticated as it was. now the thing i wanna say is...   maybe we should have talked about this before. us living together, you're not   expecting a proposal, right?

PHOEBE:
 oh no! no no! not at all. we're just moving in right now. see where   it goes.

 yeah well, that's the thing. for me it's as far as it can ever go.

PHOEBE:
 what do you mean?

 look. phoebe, i-i love you. very much. but i never want to get married   again.

PHOEBE:
 oh. wow.

 it's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. i kind of   lost faith in the whole idea.

PHOEBE:
 was it really that bad?

 at one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....

PHOEBE:
 ok, well that's bad. but don't you think it might be different with   someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in   the ocean.

 look it's not about who i would marry. and i was certain the first time   i got married it would last forever. and i was totally wrong!

PHOEBE:
 but it's just...

 look phoebe, it's not about you. i just never wanna get married again.

PHOEBE:
 oh!

 i'm sorry. are you ok with that? cause if not...maybe us moving in together   isn't the best idea.

PHOEBE:
 no! i definitely don't wanna get married. no i just wanted to make   sure you didn't want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in and you start   changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!

 trust me, i will never...

PHOEBE:
 yeah i get that.  

RACHEL:
 hi!

MONICA:
 so you gave in and decided to call someone?

RACHEL:
 yeah, i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.

 you're all set. 

RACHEL:
 oh thank you so much.    you forgot your erm...your game. 

 thanks..... 

CHANDLER:
 hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.

RACHEL:
 don't look at me i never get his jokes.

MONICA:
 thank you?

CHANDLER:
 oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing   i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not... two...   single things.

MONICA:
 ok, you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad?

CHANDLER:
 no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for your form.

MONICA:
 ok..you know the old classics you know,you look nice? they're still   ok.

CHANDLER:
 well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice.   i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it. at all. and more   specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.

MONICA:
 okay...

CHANDLER:
 i mean, you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would   you? don't answer that. 

RACHEL:
 just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.

MONICA:
 i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?

RACHEL:
 i don't know! i mean, what brought that on?

MONICA:
 oh my god. we're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting   to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.

RACHEL:
 no you really think that's what it is?

MONICA:
 you heard him! "no bigger!" "you're perfect!" "just   don't get any bigger!" oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling   coach. you know what? i'm going to have to talk to chandler.

RACHEL:
 yeah! if you don't i will! of course your body's gonna change. your   breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose   bladder control.  

PHOEBE:
 hi

ROSS:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage.

ROSS:
 oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? i mean i can see for   all hanging out but to come to my home!

PHOEBE:
 no...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.

ROSS:
 why?

PHOEBE:
 mike doesn't ever wanna get married.

ROSS:
 never?

PHOEBE:
 never.

ROSS:
 wow, are you still going to move in with him?

PHOEBE:
 i want to, but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really   that big a deal. you know that i won't, i won't be missing out on anything.   that marriage stinks!

ROSS:
 yeah, marriage... stinks! i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight   and a woman stop shaving? get them married.

PHOEBE:
 that's not how you really feel is it?

ROSS:
 no, i'm sorry. look i don't think that's what you wanna hear right now   but i can't help it. i love marriage.

PHOEBE:
 seriously? you divorce-o?

ROSS:
 if you have to call me name, i prefer "ross the divorcer".   it's just cooler. look, i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. but i love   to be that committed to another person. and carol had some good times before   she became a lesbian... and once afterward. i'm sorry.

PHOEBE:
 it's ok that's how you feel.

ROSS:
 but come on! i mean living together will be great! i mean you guys have   so much fun and you love mike.

PHOEBE:
 i do love mike.

ROSS:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

CHANDLER:

RACHEL:
 argh. fascist

MONICA:
 well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!   and you know what? it's not just my breasts. my ass is going to get bigger   too.

CHANDLER:
 your ass?!?!?

RACHEL:
 man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!

CHANDLER:
 they...do that?

MONICA:
 it's kind of a package deal!

CHANDLER:
 god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?

MONICA:
 i thought i was something that we both wanted!

CHANDLER:
 alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get   on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?

RACHEL:
 oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to   be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present   that's shooting out of her!?

CHANDLER:
   

RACHEL:
 joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?

JOEY:
 because she is!

MONICA:
 joey, chandler knows i borrowed the money.

JOEY:
 mmmm hmm! for your boob job!

 it's over/joe!

JOEY:
 ok so i'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any   bigger?  

ROSS:
 hey! what do you guys think about this. "ross: the divorce-force".

PHOEBE:
 better.

 very cool.

ROSS:
 hey pheebs, you know i'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the   other day and i hope i was a little helpful.

PHOEBE:
 oh yeah you were helpful! yeah, no, thanks you.

ROSS:
 good, good. yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised   i don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.

PHOEBE:
 what do you mean?

ROSS:
 well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in   the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? i mean can you honestly   picture yourself in a volvo?

PHOEBE:
 they are awfully boxy...

ROSS:
 i don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. i mean it's so... normal.

PHOEBE:
 uh huh. 

ROSS:
 hey hey, can i help?

CHANDLER:
 well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow   hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets   really tricky.

ROSS:
 you know sometimes your words... they hurt.

JOEY:
 hey uh, where do you guys want this?

RACHEL:
 yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.    mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.

PHOEBE:
 just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle   room? none at all?

 no but... you don't want to get married either right?

PHOEBE:
 right. except that i do want to get married.

JOEY:
 

 you wanna get married?

PHOEBE:
 someday.

CHANDLER:
 aaaaand....... hernia.

PHOEBE:
 i haven't exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was   missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the   regular stuff.

 but if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?

PHOEBE:
 because i just didn't know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and   i wanted to live with you.

 i want to live with you too! let's do that!

PHOEBE:
 but i don't think i can! it was ok to move in when i didn't know what   was gonna happen, but i can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.

 can we at least try living together? i mean you might change your mind   about marriage.

PHOEBE:
 are you gonna change yours?

 no.

PHOEBE:
 me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.

 but i don't want this to end.

PHOEBE:
 i don't want it to end either.

 i can't believe this is gonna end. i guess i'll have my stuff packed   up.

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

 ok... so...

 bye bye mike!/cya mike!/bye mike!/bye bye now!

RACHEL:
 i'm so sorry pheebs.

MONICA:
 we're all sorry... 

CHANDLER:
 ah, look on the bright side, i mean you won't have to live with   this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you.  ending credits  

CHANDLER:
 hey! ready to go?

ROSS:
 oh yeah, let me just finish this.

JOEY:
 hey ross, check this out! 

CHANDLER:
 what are you doin'?

ROSS:
 have you seen this? it's a new alumni website for college! it's cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.

CHANDLER:
 great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless .

ROSS:
 it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich?

CHANDLER:
 the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?

ROSS:
 uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... 

CHANDLER:
 bet she'd sleep with you now... 

ROSS:
 no... i already e-mailed her.

CHANDLER:
 let me see what you wrote about yourself: "doctor paleontology, two kids... " 

ROSS:
 you know what? i'm gonna finish this later, ok? let me just grab my coat.

JOEY:
 hey! 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 maybe we finish this for him! 

JOEY:
 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:
 dude! 

ROSS:
 i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!

JOEY:
  opening credits 

RACHEL:
 hey! how was basketball?

JOEY:
 oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye!

RACHEL:
 oh, no! who did that?

JOEY:
 chandler... hey... 

RACHEL:
 she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let her sleep with him. that's all right? isn't it?

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him!

JOEY:
 rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? i do not love hugsy. i like him a normal amount... 

RACHEL:
 all right... oh, emma loves him!

JOEY:
 why wouldn't she? he's a wonderful person! 

PHOEBE:
 hi.

MONICA:
 hey phoebe... how you doin'? you feelin' better?

PHOEBE:
 breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike!

CHANDLER:
 oh, i'm so sorry!

PHOEBE:
 oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!! 

CHANDLER:
 you're not gonna need my help?

PHOEBE:
 well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you.

CHANDLER:
 oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth 

PHOEBE:
 ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never wants to get married and i shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon i'm gonna miss him so much. i'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.

MONICA:
 ok, you got it!

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 really? if that's what you want... 

PHOEBE:
 that was a test and you just failed.

MONICA:
 damn it! rookie mistake! 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 i believe i read that somewhere!

ROSS:
 that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long...  

CHANDLER:
 i respectfully disagree.

ROSS:
 i can't believe you put that on my alumni page!

CHANDLER:
 who cares? nobody reads those things

ROSS:
 you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today.

CHANDLER:
 i don't have a page.

ROSS:
 oh oh oh! i respectfully disagree!! 

JOEY:
 look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. 

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 it's okay, it's okay rach, it's me. put down the scrunchy.

RACHEL:
 what are you doing?

JOEY:
 well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy.

RACHEL:
 oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that i'm up i'm going to go to the bathroom.

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  

CHANDLER:
 because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.

MONICA:
 but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true. 

CHANDLER:
 would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! 

MONICA:
 what are you doing?

CHANDLER:
 oh, you'll see my friend. 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 posting that i died? that really isn't funny.

CHANDLER:
 well, how you died was funny.

ROSS:
 oh please, hit by a blimp?

CHANDLER:
 it kills over one americans every year.

ROSS:
 unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings here.

CHANDLER:
 you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west!

ROSS:
 you've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. that's right! your coming out is about to get real graphic. 

PHOEBE:
 god, i wish mike were here.

MONICA:
 okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing? 

MONICA:
 what are you, animals? it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!

PHOEBE:
 i gotta call him. just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.

MONICA:
 phoebe, that's how it starts. i don't need to eat the cake, i'll just smell the icing... why don't i just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. and next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. phoebe, honey, i know this is hard. look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. and if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. i know that's not what you want. 

PHOEBE:
 here.

MONICA:
 and now your cell.

PHOEBE:
 okay 

MONICA:
 this is your cellphone?

PHOEBE:
 yes.

MONICA:
 this is your current cellphone?

PHOEBE:
 yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.

MONICA:
 phoebe, where's your purse? 

MONICA:
 no, no! give it to me!

PHOEBE:
 you can't have it.

MONICA:
 give it to me!

PHOEBE:
 no 

MONICA:
 i'll go in there.

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 phoebe come here 

MONICA:
 haha!

PHOEBE:
 damn you monica geller hyphen bing! 

JOEY:
 hey, look who's here! it's joey, and he brought home a friend.

RACHEL:
 joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.

JOEY:
 no, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new hugsy!

RACHEL:
 oh that's so great, now emma has two hugsy's.

JOEY:
 no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh? the other hugsy, i don't know, i guess i'll just take it back.

RACHEL:
 oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail... 

JOEY:
 make the transfer! 

RACHEL:
 should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can't find it?

JOEY:
 oh, no don't worry about that, i swallowed that years ago. 

RACHEL:
 oh, i don't think she likes the new hugsy.

JOEY:
 but he's the same.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i think she wants the old one back.

JOEY:
 but he's the same.

RACHEL:
 joey, come on!

JOEY:
 he's the same! 

JOEY:
  

MONICA:
 haha!

PHOEBE:
 you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after i've buzzed you into the building.

MONICA:
 so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.

PHOEBE:
 those are my shoes.

MONICA:
 oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.

PHOEBE:
 monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but i'm actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kinda want to be alone right now. 

MONICA:
 who's that? 

PHOEBE:
 i ordered chinese food. 

PHOEBE:
 what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!?

MONICA:
 

 phoebe called me.

MONICA:
 phoebe!

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry, i broke down...  i wanted to see him.

MONICA:
 damnit phoebe! how did you even call him?

PHOEBE:
 there is a speakerphone on the base unit... 

MONICA:
 base unit! think monica! think!

 look, if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see... 

MONICA:
 

 oh! sorry, i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name!

MONICA:
 look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.

PHOEBE:
 not if nothing happens. why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?

MONICA:
 sure! if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll join ya. you know, i'm your friend 

PHOEBE:
 sit down. 

MONICA:
 oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend! 

 

MONICA:
 i've been pretty good!

 

PHOEBE:
 thanks, you look good too.

MONICA:
 oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean!

PHOEBE:
 so how's the piano playing going?

 actually i've been playing a lot of love songs lately. i've missed you.

PHOEBE:
 i've missed you too. 

MONICA:
 you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it! 

CHANDLER:
 hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... 

ROSS:
 uhu uhu, check this out. 

CHANDLER:
 huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya?

ROSS:
 eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little "ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead. 

CHANDLER:
 no, come on, you know that's not true.

ROSS:
 what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead!

CHANDLER:
 well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.

ROSS:
 i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy! 

CHANDLER:
 alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.

ROSS:
 you're right. there isn't a decent outlet.

CHANDLER:
 right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.

ROSS:
 exactly!! 

CHANDLER:
 ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? 

ROSS:
 no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me!

CHANDLER:
 ross, don't press send, don't press se... !

ROSS:
 oh, too late, too late! it's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...  

RACHEL:
 i'm trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy?

JOEY:
 original or crappy?

RACHEL:
 original.

JOEY:
 no, sorry haven't seen him.

RACHEL:
 then what's that big lump under your covers?

JOEY:
 it's monica, ok?

RACHEL:
 that's not monica!

JOEY:
 alright!! fine! it's original hugsy! no, now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him..

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 ... she's being unreasonable!

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 it does?

RACHEL:
 yeah! and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much.

JOEY:
 really? she... she loves me?

RACHEL:
 oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, don't worry. emma will totally understand. i won't... but whatever 

JOEY:
 ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then...  well she can have him.

RACHEL:
 oooh... you're sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up. 

JOEY:
 look forget it forget it...  i can't do it.

RACHEL:
 are you gonna...  you're going to take hugsy away from a little child?

JOEY:
 how do you think i got him in the first place?  

MONICA:
 alright you two, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. now i don't want anything going on while i'm gone. here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it.

 i've missed you so much! no, i'm not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.

PHOEBE:
 i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?

 it can't be any harder than this... i mean, if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time, i... i would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time...  i never would have stopped.

MONICA:
 

PHOEBE:
 what?

MONICA:
 didn't you hear that speech? if you don't kiss him then i will!

PHOEBE:
 oh, i missed you so much! 

 

 oh, crap!

PHOEBE:
 who is this?

 my friend manny. i asked him to keep me away from you.

MONICA:
 hi, that's what i'm doing for phoebe!

 well, you are not doing a very good job!

MONICA:
 excuse me?

 what's with the kissing?

MONICA:
 hey, at least i knew where my guy was.

 oh yeah yeah, thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing!

MONICA:
 you didn't hear the speech!

 i've heard the speech: 

MONICA:
 hey, it was very moving! you're just heartless!

 you're weak!

MONICA:
 you're... weird!

 your pants are undone!

MONICA:
 oh 

 

MONICA:
 damn it!

 oh we blew it. i blame myself.

MONICA:
 and i blame you too. 

ROSS:
 it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted! 

CHANDLER:
 there you go! someone came!

ROSS:
 ok, ok! i'm gonna go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!  

MONICA:
 hi, glad you could come.

CHANDLER:
 

 hi, you're chandler bing, right? i'm tom gordon, i was in your class.

CHANDLER:
 oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.

 thanks... uh... i'm so sorry about ross, it's... 

CHANDLER:
 at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps 

ROSS:
 who is he?

CHANDLER:
 some guy, tom gordon.

ROSS:
 i don't remember him, but then again i touched so many lives. 

MONICA:
 so, did you know ross well?

 oh, actually i barely knew him. yeah, i came because i heard chandler's news. d'you know if he's seeing anyone?

MONICA:
 

 what? you... you... oh! can i ask you a personal question? ho-how do you shave your beard so close?

CHANDLER:
 

 

CHANDLER:
 ok! 

ROSS:
 

MONICA:
 i look like a man??

CHANDLER:
 please, one ridiculous problem at a time!

ROSS:
 it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here!

CHANDLER:
 you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand!

ROSS:
 yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone?

CHANDLER:
 oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something?

ROSS:
  

CHANDLER:
 i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide.  

 hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service.

CHANDLER:
 kori? kori weston?

 yeah... 

CHANDLER:
 wow! you look amazing!

 and you are... 

CHANDLER:
 chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all.

MONICA:
 you are married though.

CHANDLER:
 don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! 

 i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad.

CHANDLER:
 i didn't know ross and you were so close.

 we weren't but we had one class together. he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. i always remembered him.

CHANDLER:
 i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.

 i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. i guess i really missed my chance.

ROSS:
 

 you sick freak, who does that? i can't believe i had a crush on you! 

ROSS:
 did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!! ending credits 

JOEY:
 monica, hey, can i borrow the porsche?

MONICA:
 ok.

JOEY:
 alright!

MONICA:
 but ehm...what is it not?

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 and what else is it not?

JOEY:
 

MONICA:
 very good!  for anyway?

JOEY:
 oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in new york, so...

RACHEL:
 oh! so you're driving up to connecticut?

JOEY:
  virginia.

MONICA:
 hey, maybe i'll drive you up there! i'd like to buy some tickets myself! 

JOEY:
 uh!

MONICA:
 yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million? no thank you!

PHOEBE:
 hey will you get me tickets too?

RACHEL:
 yeah me too. oh! i have an idea. why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!

 yeah thats a great idea!

ROSS:
 no thanks!

PHOEBE:
 you don't wanna win the lottery?

ROSS:
  be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart.

CHANDLER:
 still on amelia earhart?

ROSS:
 the woman just vanished!

JOEY:
 seriously, ross, you don't want in on this?

ROSS:
 no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.

CHANDLER:
 yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.

JOEY:
 i like those odds!

ROSS:
 seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.

CHANDLER:
  boohaki?

ROSS:
 oh oh, we think emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.

RACHEL:
 yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.

MONICA:
 how do you know she's gonna start talking?

RACHEL:
 well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i'm saying.

CHANDLER:
 kinda like joey.

JOEY:
  opening credits  

MONICA:
 god! look at all these tickets! it's so exciting! you know i haven't won anything since the sixth grade.

CHANDLER:
 pie eating contest?

MONICA:
 oh! you assume because i was heavy that's the only way i could win something? 

CHANDLER:
 no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.

MONICA:
  

ROSS:
  towing your car!!

MONICA:
 i'm parked in a garage on morton! 

ROSS:
 

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

JOEY:

RACHEL:
 she dropped off a casserole?

JOEY:
 oh yeah! the casserole lady.

MONICA:

ROSS:

CHANDLER:
  get it, i'll get it!! 

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 

RACHEL:
 

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

MONICA:
 hey that reminds me, i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work.

ROSS:
  else a chance!

MONICA:
 alright, who wants to do it?

PHOEBE:
 oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it's really not fair either! you know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!

MONICA:
 ok, hey rach?

RACHEL:
 oh no, i'm good, i don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.

JOEY:
 i'll do it!! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine. 

PHOEBE:
 i hope i win!

MONICA:
 well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?

JOEY:
 i can't tell you what i'm wishing for! else...you know...won't come true!

MONICA:
 right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!

JOEY:
 can't really say!

MONICA:
 i understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?

JOEY:
  these questions!

 please, just do it!

PHOEBE:
 one, two, three! 

JOEY:
 i won, hey!

ROSS:
 you know what, i'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  gets hot!!

RACHEL:
 you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you gonna feel if we actually do win?

ROSS:
 uh, you're not gonna win.

RACHEL:
 oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you gonna feel? you know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, i can't guys, i'll meet you guys up there, i gotta gas up the hyundai"

ROSS:
 ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that.

CHANDLER:
 i can see the headline now: "lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".

ROSS:
 why would i eat my own arm?

CHANDLER:
 well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.

MONICA:
 you know what, ross? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.

ROSS:
 why?

MONICA:
 because i know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. and you're my brother, and i want you to be a part of this.

ROSS:
 you don't have to do that, i'll pay for myself. but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! come here 

PHOEBE:
 get a room!

CHANDLER:
 ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?

ROSS:
 i don't know, probably just invest it.

CHANDLER:
 ooh! calm down ...

JOEY:
 seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it? 

ROSS:
 oh, i'm sorry, did i say "invest it"? i meant "be cool and piss it all away" 

JOEY:
 ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks!

RACHEL:
 i don't really care about the knicks.

JOEY:
 oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward.

RACHEL:
 

CHANDLER:
 you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.

JOEY:
 you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me!

CHANDLER:
 you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.

ROSS:
  numbers, mommy? 

CHANDLER:
  ... mommy?

ROSS:
 oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel "mommy" when we're around emma. which i now realize we are not ...

RACHEL:
 i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.

ROSS:
 although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "daddy" too.

PHOEBE:
 oooh, i like that, "daddy" 

ROSS:
 i ... i was just talking about rachel.

PHOEBE:
  daddy gonna spank me?

ROSS:
  been a baaad gi ..  

CHANDLER:
 hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye. 

JOEY:
 dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right?

CHANDLER:
 well no, charlie's gonna get that.

MONICA:
 hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!

CHANDLER:
 he's the boss's son.

MONICA:
 come on, lottery!! 

RACHEL:
 ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.

MONICA:
 ok, here we go. we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?  divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.

RACHEL:
 ooh, i have another idea!

MONICA:
 i'm sorry, idea time is over.

PHOEBE:
 ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?

MONICA:
 yeah.

CHANDLER:
 what about the ones you have on the nightstand?

MONICA:
 there are no tickets on the nightstand!

CHANDLER:
 yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago. 

MONICA:
 un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken!

CHANDLER:
 honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!

MONICA:
 chandler, sense the tone!! 

RACHEL:
 well, well, well, look what mommy found!! 

MONICA:
 ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler.

PHOEBE:
 uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.

ROSS:
 i can't believe this, i thought we were all in this together!

MONICA:
 hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!

ROSS:
 3 minutes ago!!! i don't know why that's important ...

JOEY:
 i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did you even get those?

MONICA:
 when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!

JOEY:
 

RACHEL:
 ok, well monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?

MONICA:
 please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!

RACHEL:
 chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?

CHANDLER:
  tickets just for us ...

MONICA:
 ahhh!  

CHANDLER:
 let me finish ...  doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!  

MONICA:
 there's the man i married!!

RACHEL:
 all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!

MONICA:
 fine! don't be my friends! i'll buy new friends! yeah, and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!

RACHEL:
  want my share of the tickets 

JOEY:
 yeah, i want my tickets too  ! and i'm buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah!

ROSS:
 than i want mine, too  if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.

PHOEBE:
 oh, you guys! we've got to keep all the tickets together 

MONICA:
 no, no! we should divide them up  and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them!

JOEY:
 hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea! 

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!

RACHEL:
 ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up!  

JOEY:
 

PHOEBE:
   ooooohhhhh!

ROSS:
 

PHOEBE:
   fine, i can't take it anymore! i'm putting an end to this!  

RACHEL:
 oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets.

JOEY:
 no, no!  

PHOEBE:
 if we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets!  .

 no!!

PHOEBE:
 don't come any closer!

CHANDLER:
 can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...

PHOEBE:
 no, what's more important, your friends or money?

 friends! 

MONICA:
 money! 

PHOEBE:
 hey monica, what about your extra tickets?

MONICA:
 they're all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra 

ROSS:
 monica!

PHOEBE:
 ok, good!  no way i was gonna dump this...  oh god, no!  your bowl.

ROSS:
 go, go, go!!   

PHOEBE:
 what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun.

MONICA:
 phoebe, we lost half of them.

PHOEBE:
 so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i  was gonna win, remember?

ROSS:
 weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...

PHOEBE:
 as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die. 

CHANDLER:
  messages. these could be from work!

MONICA:
 oh, play them!

CHANDLER:
 ok, here we go! 

  the balcony calling to apologise"  sh.. i shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. it-it was all my fault. not hers. bye. coo." 

PHOEBE:
 well, i bet that was very hard for him to do.

 "hey chandler, it's charlie"

CHANDLER:
 this is..shhh!

 "listen, oh... it turns i got the last spot. i'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. give me a call if you want."

MONICA:
 oh god, i am so sorry honey...

 oh, so sorry man! sorry!

RACHEL:
 oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted sandra over me at work.

CHANDLER:
 oh, is she related to ralph lauren?

RACHEL:
 no, she was just much better at job than me!

PHOEBE:
 guys, the drawing is about to start!

RACHEL:
  house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down.

ROSS:
 oh yeah, it's a good idea!

MONICA:
  about this, i know how badly you wanted that job.

CHANDLER:
 yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it.  chances to win, right?

MONICA:
  131! 

ROSS:
  remember, you're daddy's little girl...  phoebe's totally ruined that for me...  

RACHEL:
 hi mum, put her back on!

JOEY:
  they are announcing the numbers! my god, i can already feel myself changing.

 "here we are, the official powerball numbers! we have 53"

CHANDLER:
 i got that!

ROSS:
 oh, we have one too!!

MONICA:
 we are on a roll, people!!

ROSS:
 

RACHEL:
  lips, but i can barely understand you! would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?

 "and number 29! here we go! the powerball is 7"

MONICA:
 check your numbers! make me rich!

RACHEL:
  guys, you're not gonna believe this! i was just saying goodnight to emma and she said her first words!!

 wow!

JOEY:
 and what did she say?

RACHEL:
 she said "gleba"!!   

MONICA:
 make me rich!!

RACHEL:
 

ROSS:
 oh yeah, no no no...that's great!

RACHEL:
 why-why aren't you more excited?

ROSS:
 oh, rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.

RACHEL:
 oh, but of course it is!

ROSS:
 okay, what does it mean?

RACHEL:
 i don't know all the words.

ROSS:
 i'm just, i'm just glad i didn't miss my daughter's first words 

ROSS:
 yes you did, gleba is a word!

ROSS:
 ok, use it in a sentence.

RACHEL:
 ok... "emma just said gleba"!

ROSS:
 it's not a word!

RACHEL:
 okay, okay, okay, fine, i'm gonna look it up  .

ROSS:
 oh, oh, ok, great. you know what, while you're at it she

 pbbqqt.... 

RACHEL:
  gleba...  inner mass of a certain fungi.  smug look; then she squints at the dictionary, as though unsure what to 

ROSS:
 she's gonna be a scientist!  

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 no.

PHOEBE:
 i'm still looking through mine...

MONICA:
 just double checking  

MONICA:
 

CHANDLER:
 ah, the "i'm sorry i rejected you" phone call. i'm not used to getting it from guys.   hey, steve.

 chandler, hi! i'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. we just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.

CHANDLER:
 oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!

 chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. we're offering you the position of junior copywriter.

CHANDLER:
 me, that guy who just said butt cracks?

 yes, that's right. we're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.

CHANDLER:
 ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow   

CHANDLER:
 what?  copywriter.

 

MONICA:
 oh sweetie, i'm so proud of you!

CHANDLER:
 does that mean i get the good loving tonight?

MONICA:
 you bet! no tv or anything!  

JOEY:
 

CHANDLER:
 thanks, man.

JOEY:
 and i like to think i had a little something to do with it.

CHANDLER:
 really? what?

JOEY:
 well, before, with the wishbone... i didn't wish we would win the lottery, i wished you'd get the job.

CHANDLER:
   listen, don't tell monica, she'll rip your heart right out.

JOEY:
 oh yeah.

RACHEL:
 you know what? there is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.

ROSS:
 me too. so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park.

PHOEBE:
 you guys, what was the powerball number again?

 seven.

PHOEBE:
 we won.

RACHEL:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 we won!

MONICA:
 let me see! 

PHOEBE:
 don't tear it.

ROSS:
 phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.

PHOEBE:
 i know that, but look, we've got the powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!

CHANDLER:
 wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.

PHOEBE:
  anything before, i can't believe this!

RACHEL:
 so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?

PHOEBE:
 it's not all mine. we all get 50 cents.

MONICA:
 you know what? you can have mine.

CHANDLER:
 me too.

JOEY:
 me too.

RACHEL:
 me too. 

ROSS:
 i guess if everybody else is... closing credits   

JOEY:
  powerball hotline, can you believe it? nobody won.

PHOEBE:
 i beg to differ  .

 maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000  

JOEY:
  

RACHEL:
 i don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but i think a  cantaloupe might hurt less.

JOEY:
 oh, ehm...i'm...i'm rehearsing my lines.they gave me a big romantic story on days of our lives. it's the first time my character's got one. i'm so nervous, you know, i really want it to be good!

RACHEL:
 woow!i haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!

JOEY:
 yeah, that was a disappointment...

RACHEL:
 

JOEY:
 yeah!hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.

RACHEL:
 hey, that was an honest mistake!

JOEY:
 right!

RACHEL:
 yeah, that was an awesome day! opening credits 

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey!

ROSS:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:

ROSS:

MONICA:
 well you can't! we're booked solid for the next month!

PHOEBE:
 well, i can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!

ROSS:
 phoebe, what happened?

PHOEBE:
 well, it was an accident...you know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! 

PHOEBE:
 oh no!you guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!

CHANDLER:
 what? no, i'm taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont 

PHOEBE:
 oh, good!ok, good for you!try to recapture the magic!

CHANDLER:

CHANDLER:

MONICA:
 yeah, i'm sorry. i really am.

CHANDLER:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
 and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing!

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 oh, don't worry about it! just use your travel insurance.

CHANDLER:
 i don't have travel insurance.

ROSS:
 well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!

MONICA:
 why don't you take ross?

ROSS:
 uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? i mean, two guys in a romantic inn...

MONICA:
 no, not if their room has two beds!

ROSS:
  

RACHEL:
 hey joey, is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity?

JOEY:
 i don't know, but one of the extras sure did! 

RACHEL:
 oh, please!honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, i'm...oh my god!is that christian sanders?he's so gorgeous!

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

 joey, joey! we're ready for you!

JOEY:
 oh, wish me luck!

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

 i don't have a choice...

 yes, you do.yes...you do. i'm the one who doesn't have a choice because i...because i can't stop loving you.

RACHEL:

MONICA:

MONICA:
 thank you!

MONICA:
 oh..please!i-i welcome criticism.

 the musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!

MONICA:
 what musician? 

PHOEBE:
 

MONICA:
 what are you doing here!

PHOEBE:
 well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so i am here to entertain!

MONICA:
 great!

PHOEBE:
 yeah! it really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! yeah, "you suck" and "shut up and go home".

MONICA:
 listen phoebe...

PHOEBE:
 yeah.

MONICA:
 you know how much i love listening to your music, you know, but...

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:
 hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation.

 welcome to the chestnut inn mr. bing, so where are you joining from?

CHANDLER:
 new york.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.

ROSS:
 yeah, i ate all my gifts for everybody.

 i am sorry mr. bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.

CHANDLER:
 well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?

ROSS:
 

 i'm sorry, it's not here.

ROSS:
 not there.

CHANDLER:
 let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?

 i don't know what to say.

ROSS:
 

CHANDLER:
 just give us the cheapest room you have.

 unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.

CHANDLER:
 that's insane!

ROSS:
 totally insane. dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.

CHANDLER:
 does that room have a closet i can lock him in? 

 great.

CHANDLER:
 

ROSS:
 dude, don't worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! like those apples. instead of taking one, i'm... i take six!

CHANDLER:
 great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!

ROSS:
 c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!

CHANDLER:
 dude, you're shaking!

ROSS:
 i think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
