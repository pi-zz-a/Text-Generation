JOEY:
  hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?

CHANDLER:
  well, let me see... i-i believe i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv.

JOEY:
 look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.

CHANDLER:
 i could fall asleep at a play.

PHOEBE:
 what is it?

JOEY:
 it's a one-woman play called "why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".

MONICA:
 it sounds interesting!

ROSS:
 yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, i don't think it gets bett... 

PHOEBE:
 i know, i know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?

JOEY:
 you guys are gonna have a great time, i promise!

ROSS:
 what? how come that you don't have to go!

JOEY:
 i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.

CHANDLER:
  uh, let's see, who do i hate?

RACHEL:
  oh, sorry... oops, sorry.

JOEY:
  hey, here you go.

RACHEL:
 ooh... oooh...  can i ask you a question?

MONICA:
 yeah.

RACHEL:
 do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?

MONICA:
 no, i don't think it ever works. why?

RACHEL:
 no reason.

MONICA:
 no, no, rachel?

RACHEL:
 yeah

MONICA:
 who do you wanna fool around with?

RACHEL:
  nobody, forget it!  maybe.

MONICA:
  you can't!

RACHEL:
  seriously i did not understand a word that you said.

MONICA:
 in the hall. 

MONICA:
 you wanna fool around with joey?

RACHEL:
 yeah! you know, ever since i had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! and what's the big deal, people do it all the time!

MONICA:
 who? who do you know that are friends that just fool around?

RACHEL:
 ok, off the top of my head... don and janet.

MONICA:
 who, who are they?

RACHEL:
 i know them from work.

MONICA:
 both of them?

RACHEL:
 no, one of them...

MONICA:
 which one?

RACHEL:
 i don't know, what were the names i just said?

MONICA:
 rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.

RACHEL:
 all right, all right, you're right, i won't do anything with joey, i just thought that we 

MONICA:
 what the hell are you cooking! opening credits

ROSS:
 hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

CHANDLER:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey, you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today.

CHANDLER:
 yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.

ROSS:
  there're these two professors who are joining my department and i have to meet them here and show them around campus.

MONICA:
 what's so bad about that?

ROSS:
 it's i just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.

MONICA:
 : ross?

ROSS:
  these aren't suede.  excuse me, i'm looking for someone. you don't, by any chance, know a ross geller?

GUNTHER:
 no.

ROSS:
 hi, hi, i'm ross geller.

CHARLIE:
 oh, hi. i'm professor wealer.

ROSS:
 oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.

CHARLIE:
 it's a... it's good to meet you! thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.

ROSS:
 oh, no, it's no big deal, i mean, if i weren't doing this i'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.

MONICA:
  is he gonna introduce us?

CHANDLER:
  no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now.

CHARLIE:
 and, by the way, i really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

ROSS:
 oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute.

MONICA:
  twenty bucks says they're married within the month.

ROSS:
  we should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.

CHARLIE:
 oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?

ROSS:
 i don't think so.

CHARLIE:
 i'm pretty sure, professor spafford from cornell?

ROSS:
 oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all".  shall we?

CHARLIE:
 you don't think we should wait for him?

ROSS:
 you know what, he's a big boy, i'm sure he'll find us, ok?

PROFESSOR SPAFFORD:
 professor geller?

ROSS:
 oh, damn it!   hi joey it's jane rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. listen, i forgot your address, can you give me a call? thanks, bye.

JOEY:
  hey!

RACHEL:
 hey!

JOEY:
 what's happenin'?

RACHEL:
 yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.

JOEY:
 oh, i'd love to, but i gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... 

MESSAGE:
 "hi joey, it's jane rogers can't wait for your party tonight" 

JOEY:
  stupid jane rogers!!

RACHEL:
  you are having a party tonight??

JOEY:
 kinda have a... a thing for the days of our life's people.

RACHEL:
 and you weren't going to tell us? how did you think you were gonna get away with that?

JOEY:
 i do it every year.

RACHEL:
 you do that every year??

JOEY:
 i didn't have to tell you that!! i'm stupider than jane rogers!!

RACHEL:
 oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??

JOEY:
 yeah...

RACHEL:
 and last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?

JOEY:
 yeah...

RACHEL:
 oh! and the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?

JOEY:
  i can't believe you guys went for that one!

RACHEL:
 joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?

JOEY:
 you're fine, ok? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!

RACHEL:
 well, then so you just invite me...!

JOEY:
  please, i was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!

RACHEL:
 oh, joey, come on! please, please! let me come, i will behave, i promise! i will behave! please, please, please...

JOEY:
 ok, ok! fine! you can come, but don't tell anybody else. it's up on the roof at 8.

RACHEL:
  and it's out of my system! 

PROFESSOR SPAFFORD:
  and then my wife and i went on a cruise to the galapagos. there was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. there were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. it's a pity i'm allergic to shellfish.

ROSS:
  so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?

PROFESSOR SPAFFORD:
 and that's not all i'm allergic to.

ROSS:
  oh, it's not over!

PROFESSOR SPAFFORD:
 i'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...

ROSS:
 so basically all nuts?

PROFESSOR SPAFFORD:
 interestingly... no.

CHARLIE:
 kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".

PROFESSOR SPAFFORD:
 if you'll excuse me i'm going to use the restroom. 

CHARLIE:
 oh my god!!

ROSS:
 i've lost the will to live.

CHARLIE:
 let's ditch him!

ROSS:
 what?

CHARLIE:
 come on, he's still in the bathroom! i'm begging you!

ROSS:
 oh... ok, fine. but... ehm... i just have one question for you, ehm...  when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...

CHARLIE:
 stop it, stop it! he talks slow but he might pee fast! ok, let's go!!  

ROSS:
  oh, hey you guys! this is charlie! charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica.

PHOEBE:
 hi!

ROSS:
 yeah, charlie is gonna be joining my department.

PHOEBE:
 oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  oh, ok, now, what do you think of ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?

CHARLIE:
 well, i think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...

PHOEBE:
 ah, ah.

CHARLIE:
 

ROSS:
  ranion's theory of species variegation?

PHOEBE:
 yeah, i saw the article on your coffee table and i memorized the title to freak you out!

MONICA:
  so, did you two have fun?

ROSS:
 oh my god, she's great! i mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...

MONICA:
 and i don't know if you've noticed but she's a  hi!

RACHEL:
  hey... hi you guys! listen, you know what? i'm not feeling really well. i think i can't get out for the play.

ROSS:
 really? wh-what's wrong?

RACHEL:
 i don't know! i think it's kind of serious! oh, you know... i was watching this thing on tv this morning about... newcastle disease... and i think i might have it!!

CHARLIE:
 oh, newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.

RACHEL:
 ... ok, who is this?

ROSS:
 i'm sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she's a collegue.

RACHEL:
 oh, hi! i would check your hand but... i'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!

MONICA:
 hey, rachel, can-can i see you for a sec?

RACHEL:
 sure!  oh...

MONICA:
 you're not sick!

RACHEL:
 what? yes, i am!

MONICA:
 ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??

RACHEL:
 when you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! 

MONICA:
 you just wanna stay home so you can make a move on joey!

RACHEL:
 oh, no, no! i heard you before, that is so not what this is!

MONICA:
 ok, what is this?

RACHEL:
 ok!  joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!

MONICA:
  what?

ROSS:
  wh-what's going on?

MONICA:
 joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof!

RACHEL:
 and he didn't want you guys to know about it but i came over here to tell you!!

CHARLIE:
 i thought you came to say you were sick.

RACHEL:
 ok professor or detective?

PHOEBE:
 joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?

RACHEL:
 yeah, and he does it every year! that's why he's sending you to that play! that's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!

PHOEBE:
 and that horrible museum tour!

ROSS:
 no, i arranged that...  hey you guys, i'm turning in. have fun.

PHOEBE:

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:

KYLE LOWDER:
 

MONICA:
  i love you!

JOEY:
 hey, that's why i didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...

MONICA:
 oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.

PHOEBE:
 hey!

MONICA:
  oh my god, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? i can barely control myself.

PHOEBE:
 monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where is chandler anyway? 

MONICA:
  oh my god! chandler! 

CHANDLER:
 where the hell is everybody?

 WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?! CHAPTER ONE:
 my first period. 

MONICA:
  hey! joey said no autographs! but if she's gettting one, then i want one too: to monica. and none of this "best wishes" crap. i want "love".

RACHEL:
 ok actually mon, matthew was just giving me his phone number.

MONICA:
 oh man! if i had known i was coming to this party i never would have gotten married!

MATTHEW ASHFORD:
 it was nice to meet you rachel.

RACHEL:
 nice to meet you.

MATTHEW ASHFORD:
 call me.

RACHEL:
 ok  we will!!

MONICA:
  look at you with all the guys!

RACHEL:
 yeah!

MONICA:
 i guess you have forgotten all about joey?

RACHEL:
 yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly you've forgotten about chandler!

MONICA:
 please... chandler is the love of my life...   so, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston, huh?

CHARLIE:
 actually, i'm kinda happy to be leaving... i just broke up with someeone.

ROSS:
 ooh... so sad... still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?

CHARLIE:
 actually, alby is the guy i broke up with.

ROSS:
 you... you dated albert wintermeyer?

CHARLIE:
 yeah...

ROSS:
 ... and you called him alby!?  i mean that's like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby...

CHARLIE:
 yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

ROSS:
 eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

CHARLIE:
 yes! and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...

ROSS:
  oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "access hollywood".

CHARLIE:
 ok, you want the dirt? alby was seriously insecure. i mean, he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him.

ROSS:
 who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?

CHARLIE:
 a guy who won two.

ROSS:
  two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart

CHARLIE:
 yeah... for three years.

ROSS:
 oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the nobel prize?

CHARLIE:
 ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend billy.

ROSS:
 oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?

CHARLIE:
 no, but he did just win the mcarthur genius grant.

ROSS:
 huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine? 

PHOEBE:
 hey ross!

RACHE:
 how is it going with charlie?

ROSS:
  oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.

PHOEBE:
 oh, what's the matter?

ROSS:
 she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.

RACHEL:
 i always loved that!!

ROSS:
 of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 worse?

ROSS:
 oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  oh, you... you like that?

PHOEBE:
 

ROSS:
 what? 

RACHEL:
 come on! i think this is funny!  

BITTER LADY:
 well, i bet you are all thinkin' "now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?

CHANDLER:
  oh yes, god yes!!

BITTER LADY:
  how could he leave me?!?!

CHANDLER:
 i... i don't know... you seem lovely. 

JOEY:
 hey ross, this is one of my co-stars, dirk. 

ROSS:
 nice to meet you.

DIRK:
 hey! so what show are you on?

ROSS:
 oh, i'm no actor, i'm a professor of palaeontology.

JOEY:
 it's a science.

DIRK:
 oh! hey well listen, i play a scientist on "days". and my character has just won the nobel prize.

JOEY:
 hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...

ROSS:
 oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.

DIRK:
 hey, i got a 690 on my sats.

ROSS:
 i'd lead with that. .

JOEY:
 monica!

MONICA:
 don't worry joe, i won't come next year!  what have you got there?

ROSS:
 just some boys gave me their phone numbers.

JOEY:
 ah, let me see!  damn, that's a lot of guys! are you a little slutty?

RACHEL:
  i think i am.

JOEY:
 . and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and i don't feel any different.  pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...

RACHEL:
  why, why, what's wrong with these guys?

JOEY:
 nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.

RACHEL:
 joey, you're so sweet.

JOEY:
 that's true. but you know what, it doesn't matter because i already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.

RACHEL:
 who ?

JOEY:
 me.

RACHEL:
  really?

JOEY:
 yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!

RACHEL:
 oh! screw it, i didn't get it! 

JOEY:
 gotcha.

RACHEL:
 oh, very funny... joey.  so, how did you enjoy the play?

MONICA:
 oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry.

CHANDLER:
 well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.

MONICA:
 you really liked it?

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because as a man i've been trained  but after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", i was uplifted.

MONICA:
 oh really!

CHANDLER:
 oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!

MONICA:
 no!

CHANDLER:
 did somebody sign your bra?

MONICA:
 so i got it when i was 13... 

PHOEBE:
 hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper?

ROSS:
 it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.

PHOEBE:
 go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average joe phd.

ROSS:
 yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited.

PHOEBE:
 you're so much more than just brains! you're sweet, and kind, and funny...

ROSS:
 and sexy.

PHOEBE:
 ok well give her a chance to see all of that!

ROSS:
 yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her.

PHOEBE:
 good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch!

ROSS:
 stop going through my stuff !  hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 i just wanted to let you know i've changed my mind: i'm gonna do it, i'm gonna kiss joey.

MONICA:
 no, you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea.

RACHEL:
 please, what about you and chandler?

MONICA:
 that's different! i was drunk and stupid!

RACHEL:
 well hello !

MONICA:
 what about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? why don't you just kiss one of them?

RACHEL:
 i could, i could but i don't want to! i want to kiss joey!

MONICA:
 alright . i think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.

RACHEL:
  i'm gonna do it.

MONICA:
 and i can't stop you.

RACHEL:
 no.  hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?

ROSS:
 i'm smarter than him! closing credits

PHOEBE:
 hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler.

CHANDLER:
 oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you.

MONICA:
 oh, you're so wonderful.

BITTER WOMAN:
 why don't you like me! chapter one: my first period.
