MONICA:

PHOEBE:

CHANDLER:
 thank you. i got a job in advertising.  

MONICA:
  oh, honey, that's incredible! 

PHOEBE:
  

CHANDLER:

JOEY:
 oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'.  

CHANDLER:
 right. so, it'll be the same except… less sex with you.  

ROSS:
 so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? 

CHANDLER:
 well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. 

PHOEBE:
  that's great. 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating    

CHANDLER:
  humiliating and noble!   

ROSS:
 you know, if i didn't already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising. 

MONICA:
 ross, you did not come up with "got milk?" 

ROSS:
 yes, i did, i did!  i should have written it down!  opening credits   

JOEY:
  hey!

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

RACHEL:

JOEY:

MONICA:

JOEY:
 well, it must be, because i read and i didn't understand a singe word.  

RACHEL:
 yeah, and lennart haze is starring in it… 

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah, and directing. 

MONICA:

RACHEL:

MONICA:

RACHEL AND JOEY:
  ah! 

JOEY:
 yeah, he's done some amazing works. 

RACHEL:
 oh, yeah. oh, i loved him in those cell phone commercials.  

JOEY:
  

MONICA:

JOEY:

CHANDLER:
  good morning, everybody. 

INTERN:
 can i get you a cup of coffee, sir? 

CHANDLER:
 oh, no, no, i'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that i can rent a car. 

INTERN:
 seriously, you're an intern? 

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom. 

INTERN:
  dude! 

CHANDLER:
 right. look, i know i'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope     

CHANDLER:
 the comedian? uso?! 

INTERN:
  uhm, it's usa, sir.      

RECEPTIONIST:
 this is joey tribbiani. joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is lennart haze.     

JOEY:
 it is so amazing to meet you.  i'm such a big fan of your work. 

LENNART:
 well, i've… i've been blessed with a… a lot of great roles.  

JOEY:
 tell me about it! "unlimited nights and weekends!"  

LENNART:
 you making fun of me? because i am not a sell-out.  i didn't do that for the money, i believe in those phones. i almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service. 

JOEY:
 no, i-i-i wasn't making fun of you, honestly, i-i think you were great in those commercials.  

LENNART:
 really? 

JOEY:
 yeah. 

LENNART:
 well, i do bring a certain credibility to the role. 

JOEY:
  are you kiddin'? when they shoot you out of that cannon… 

LENNART:
 peeeeeooooooooch  "hang up that phone!" one take! 

JOEY:
 wow! 

LENNART:
 so, shall we read? 

JOEY:
 oh, yah, sure. 

LENNART:
 top of act two. this is my entrance. you got it?    

LENNART:
 "what the hell are you still doing here"?   

JOEY:
 err, "i think you know".  

LENNART:
 "bastard"! 

JOEY:
 "i am what you made me. you know what? i could go right now." 

LENNART:
 "go, go!" 

JOEY:
 "i can't. oh, i want to, long pause, but i can't." 

LENNART:
 i'm sorry, sorry. you're not supposed to say "long pause" 

JOEY:
  

LENNART:
 no. thank you so much for coming in. we appreciate it, thank you.  

JOEY:
 ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? i could do it with an accent, you know, southern  "i could go right now, maaan!" 

LENNART:
  my god in heaven.    

PRODUCER #1:
 joey, hang on for a second. lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?   

LENNART:
 you, you gotta be kidding. see, h-he, he can't act. .    

LENNART:
 hey! i-i-i don't care if he's hot, you know. if you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  this is a play. no, listen: if you insist on this, i will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think i'm next door.   

JOEY:
  you should, please, just gimme another chance. i really wanna get better, please.  

LENNART:
 well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. ready? 

JOEY:
 yeah. 

LENNART:
 uhm, you're in your head. you-you're thinking way too much.  

JOEY:
 i really doubt that.  

LENNART:
  no, no, no. it's that you're not connected with anything in your body. there's no urgency. the scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. also, what you did was horizontal. don't be afraid to explore the vertical. and don't learn the words. let the words learn you.    

JOEY:
  couldn't i just sleep with the producer?    

PHOEBE:
 hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? 

ROSS:
 oh, i can't. i've got a date with that waitress, katy, yeah, i know we've been only going out like twice, but i have a really good feeling about her.  

PHOEBE:
 oh, i hear divorce bells.    

MUGGER:
 alright. just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.  

ROSS:
  what? 

MUGGER:
 i have a gun  

ROSS:
 o-ok. just relax, phoene, just stay calm. . oh my god, i can't find my wallet.    

MUGGER:
 alright, lady, now give me your purse! 

PHOEBE:
 no. 

ROSS:
  what do you mean "no"? i knew you'd be my death, phoebe buffay.    

PHOEBE:
 lowell, is that you? 

LOWELL:
 phoebe?  oh my god! 

PHOEBE:
  oh my god!    

PHOEBE:
  i'm sorry, ross, this is my old friend lowell from the streets. lowell, ross. 

LOWELL:
 ross, nice to meet you.   

ROSS:
 yeah, a real pleasure. 

PHOEBE:
 ah, it's been so long, so long.  i can't believe you're still doing this! 

LOWELL:
 ough, i know, but i quit smoking! 

PHOEBE:
 good for you!  

LOWELL:
 so you look like you're doing really well! i guess you're mugging days are behind you? 

PHOEBE:
 ouh…  

ROSS:
  oh my god. phoebe, you used to mug people?  

PHOEBE:
 excuse me, ross, old friends catching up…    

MONICA:
 hey, how did the audition go?  

JOEY:
 well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, lennart haze did not like me.   

MONICA:
 what happened? 

JOEY:
 well, he said i wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical. oh, and he said that i should think less. 

MONICA:
 so far so good!  

CHANDLER:
  honey, i'm old! 

MONICA:
  what's wrong? 

CHANDLER:
 i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them. 

MONICA:
 so you're a little older. try to look at the positive: you have all this life experience. 

CHANDLER:
 yes, but i don't think life experience with these.  

JOEY:
 wooooooooow  it's like they're on fire! 

MONICA:
 what are they?  

CHANDLER:
 they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. 

JOEY:
  i give you $ 500 for them! 

CHANDLER:
 what am i supposed to do with these? 

MONICA:
 ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time. 

CHANDLER:
 well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and i think i heard somebody say "slorps".  would you help me try to sell these? 

MONICA:
 okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?  

CHANDLER:
 no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.  

JOEY:
 hey, that'd work on me! why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords?     

ALL:
 hey, hey! 

ROSS:
 hey, you'll never guess what just happened… phoebe and i got mugged! 

MONICA:
 you okay?! 

ROSS:
  yah, because phoebe knew the mugger!  

MONICA:
  how do you know a mugger? 

PHOEBE:
 i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us.  

ROSS:
 you wanna know how she knew him?  because phoebe used to mug people.  

MONICA:
  seriously? 

PHOEBE:
 well, i'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i… 

MONICA:
  phoebe, that is awful! 

PHOEBE:
 well, ok, i wasn't rich like you guys, ok, i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer… 

MONICA:
 you're mother killed herself! 

PHOEBE:
 she was a drug dealer! 

ROSS:
 well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because  i was about to do some serious damage!  

PHOEBE:
  okay… 

MONICA:
 well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, ross. 

PHOEBE:
 why? 

MONICA:
 well, ross was mugged as a kid. 

PHOEBE:
  you were? 

ROSS:
 yeah, it was pretty traumatic. i was outside st. marc's comics… you know, i-i-i was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-  

MONICA:
  wonderwoman! 

ROSS:
 anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone…  … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "gimme your money, punk!" 

PHOEBE:
  oh my god… 

ROSS:
 i know! and-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book: "science boy" 

MONICA:
 oh yeah! what was his superpower again? 

ROSS:
 a superhuman thirst for knowledge. 

MONICA:
 that's it.  

ROSS:
 well, i-i better get to class  are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way, phoebe? 

PHOEBE:
 no… actually, you might wanna stay away from jane street… that's where stabby joe works.    

PHOEBE:
 okay, i think we have a problem here.  

MONICA:
 what? 

PHOEBE:
 well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marc's comics.  

MONICA:
 yeah? 

PHOEBE:
 well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.  

MONICA:
 so? 

PHOEBE:
 well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- 

PHOEBE AND MONICA:
 "geology rocks!"  

MONICA:
 oh my god! 

PHOEBE:
 i know… i mugged ross!     

RECEPTIONIST:
 you're late! 

JOEY:
  i know, i'm sorry, but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom? 

RECEPTIONIST:
 no, lennart doesn't wait! 

JOEY:
 but i'm bursting with u-hu! 

LENNART:
  joey! here we go. let's go very quickly! 

JOEY:
 actually, i really need… 

LENNART:
  we must go now, quickly, please. 

JOEY:
 yes… ahahaaa  

LENNART:
 ready? "what the hell are you still doing here?" 

JOEY:
  "i think you know!"  

LENNART:
 "oh, you sick bastard!" 

JOEY:
 "i am what you made me! you know what?" 

LENNART:
 "what?" 

JOEY:
 "i could go right now."  

LENNART:
 "then go, go!" 

JOEY:
  "i, oh, i can't. i want to, but i can't!" 

LENNART:
 cut! that was good.  that was very good. you did everything i asked for.  

JOEY:
  i did?  

LENNART:
 yes. plus… what you've got that… i don't know what you've got going… this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that i couldn't've even imagined. wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but – you know what? – more, more. can you do that? 

JOEY:
 sure, yeah. i don't have time to say thank you because i really gotta go.  

LENNART:
  look at that: still in character, i like it… i plant seeds i can't explain.    

MONICA:
 hey! 

CHANDLER:
 hey! 

MONICA:
 what are you doing? 

CHANDLER:
 putting on the sneakers… thought i'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything… 

RACHEL:
 oh, anything yet? 

CHANDLER:
 yes, how's this: they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!   

JOEY:
  hey! 

ALL:
 hey!    

JOEY:
 probably wanna know what i'm doing…? 

MONICA:
 no, that seems about right. 

JOEY:
 yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. i got a call-back, so i'm drinking everything. oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great! 

RACHEL:
 joey, that was formula. 

JOEY:
 we gotta get more of that.  

CHANDLER:
  you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren. 

RACHEL:
 okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph.  

CHANDLER:
 alright  i feel youger already!    

CHANDLER:
  yah, i think i broke my hip.    

PHOEBE:
  hey, you! 

ROSS:
 hey! 

PHOEBE:
 hey, how was class? 

ROSS:
 no one ever asked me that, what's wrong?  

PHOEBE:
 nothing, i really wanna know. 

ROSS:
 oh…  well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene… 

PHOEBE:
  alright, nothing is worth this. uhm, i have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid… 

ROSS:
  wh-what are you talking about? it wasn't a girl. it was this huge dude. 

PHOEBE:
 you don't have to lie anymore, ross, i know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. 

ROSS:
 no, it wasn't. 

PHOEBE:
 yes, it was.  

ROSS:
 no, it wasn't. you don't think i would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old… 

PHOEBE:
  "gimme your money, punk!" 

ROSS:
  oh my god, it was you! i can't believe it, you… you mugged me?  

PHOEBE:
  i mean, well, it's just that i i've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and i have… have a great one!  

ROSS:
 it's not the best! 

PHOEBE:
 i know, i'm sorry, please forgive me. i don't know what to say… 

ROSS:
  there's nothing you can say. that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.  

PHOEBE:
 really? even more humiliating than… 

ROSS:
  hey, let's not do this!       

INTERN:
 … and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other! 

BOSS:
  chander… 

CHANDLER:
 okay…  you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he's about my age… 

INTERN:
  your age? 

CHANDLER:
 a-huh. so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "not suitable for adults!"  

BOSS:
 chandler, that's great!  

CHANDLER:
 oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me  

BOSS:
 you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's….  you did you come up with that? 

CHANDLER:
  i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow. 

BOSS:
 that is great. good work!  chandler. thank you.  

BOSS:
 see all of you tomorrow.    

CHANDLER:
 the cold weather hurts my hip!    

PHOEBE:
 hey, ross!  i know you're still mad at me, but can i just talk to you for a second?  

ROSS:
 sure, go ahead. whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.  

PHOEBE:
 i just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting.     

ROSS:
   

PHOEBE:
 look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell… or smoke.  

ROSS:
 oh my god.  it's all here. what made you save it all these years?  

PHOEBE:
 i can't say, i just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.  

ROSS:
 you really thought "science boy" was worth saving!  

PHOEBE:
 yeah… but you should know, i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.  

ROSS:
 still… this is amazing… oh my god, thank you, phoebe.  

PHOEBE:
 you're welcome. and thank you for "science boy". i learned a lot from him  

ROSS:
 you're welcome.     

JOEY:
  "i need an answer!" 

LENNART:
 "i-i-i can't tell you somethin' i don't know." 

JOEY:
 "you know!" 

LENNART:
 "i don't know!" 

JOEY:
 "i need an answer now!"  

LENNART:
 "alright, here, you want an answer… the answer… is…"    

JOEY:
  oh! 

LENNART:
 "she never loved me, she only loved you." 

JOEY:
 "you knew this all along and you never told me? you never told me? i can never forgive you, i can never forgive myself, i have nothing to live for – bang – end scene!" 

LENNART:
 absolutely amazing!  the part is yours.  

JOEY:
  oh thanks, thanks! now, i really have to get… 

LENNART:
 wa-wa-wa-wait! congratulations! you did it! you did it!  you can relax now. yeah.    closing credits   

MONICA:
 wow, that's a big cable bill! huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a saturday afternoon?!  i was in the house!  

ROSS:
  hey, uhm, phoebe didn't by any chance mention that… 

MONICA:
 … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? yah.  

ROSS:
 i see. you didn't happen to tell… 

MONICA:
 … everybody we know? yeah.
