CHANDLER:
 hey!

ROSS:
 yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what  happened here last night?

CHANDLER:
 sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like  you! do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what  they did or didn't do ...i mean come on!!

ROSS:
 ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about?

CHANDLER:
 no!

ROSS:
 ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from  her office out on your balcony.

CHANDLER:
 our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica  we should put lights on our balcony. and she said"no, no. it's too cold,  nobody will go out there." and i said "maybe if we put some light out there they  will"

ROSS:
 right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel  kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were no lights !

CHANDLER:
 so are you gonna...talk to her?

ROSS:
 why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's  fine!

CHANDLER:
 you know when "that's fine" sounds true when someone yells it  and spits!

ROSS:
 no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care  but...at least she could have told me. you knowi...i've been putting my life  on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing  guys shebarely knows, then so will i ! very funny! ross is gay! ah!  ah!

CHANDLER:
 no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where  you're moving?

ROSS:
 i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now  there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.and then the other  day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

CHANDLER:
 dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!

ROSS:
 well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who  totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalpotluck dinner.

CHANDLER:
 why did i get married?!        

JOEY:
 hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken  tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks ishould have my eyebrows  waxed. is that weird for a guy?

PHOEBE:
 well it depends.

JOEY:
 on...?

PHOEBE:
 on how far along he's in the sex change process!

MONICA:
 no i totally disagree. no i think it's fine for a guy to do  something like that. such you an actor. not that you need to,your eyebrows  are...

JOEY:
 ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you're freaking me out!

PHOEBE:
 your knuckles are kinda hairy too...

JOEY:
 oh man! i have to get those done too?!

PHOEBE:
 wow! talking about high maintenance

JOEY:
 hey hey! you dye your hair!

PHOEBE:
 i'm a woman!

JOEY:
 arghhh! double standards!

PHOEBE:
 oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar  tonight?

MONICA:
 only if i don't have to get up and sing.

PHOEBE:
 but everybody sings. it's so much fun! last time this adorable  old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone  booed him off the stage. so funny.

MONICA:
 it's just, i'm not good at singing.

PHOEBE:
 oh! what's the matter? are you scared? you're afraid i'm a better  singer? you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing?

MONICA:
 no no, it's not working on me. wow! i must be growing up!

PHOEBE:
 ok fine! please come and support mike. you don't have to  sing.

MONICA:
 so i don't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass  judgments on others?

PHOEBE:
 while drinking...

MONICA:
 i'm there!

RACHEL:
 hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something  really stupid.

PHOEBE:
 well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out  there

RACHEL:
 no not that. i kissed gavin last night.

PHOEBE:
 oh my god.

MONICA:
 you kissed him?

RACHEL:
 yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony  and...

MONICA:
 wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed  that?

PHOEBE:
 it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping  paper.

MONICA:
 oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing?

RACHEL:
 you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me  and, oh and he gave me this scarf...

MONICA:
 i thought you hated him?

RACHEL:
 you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and  it turns out that line...is a scarf!

MONICA:
 so are you thinking of starting up something with this  guy?

RACHEL:
 i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you  know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don'tknow what to do  and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes.

MONICA:
 sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin,  and you definitely should talk to ross

RACHEL:
 or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...

PHOEBE:
 wow! five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss  a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!   

SALON GIRL:
 hi

JOEY:
 hey. i'm here for my eyebrow appointment.

SALON GIRL:
 name?

JOEY:
 chandler bing.

SALON GIRL:
 ok. very good. have a seat right over here mr. bing and sonia  will be right with you.

JOEY:
 ok thanks.. i touched the  stuff

SONIA:
 i'll take care of it

JOEY:
 thanks. do you get a lot of guys in here?

SONIA:
 oh absolutely.

JOEY:
 oh good...

SONIA:
 are you looking to meet somebody?

JOEY:
 all right let's just do this.

SONIA:
 we'll get to the wax in a minute. first i want to tweeze some of  the strays, ok? this may sting just a little bit...

JOEY:
 please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my  face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right!just a little bit of shock  that's all but i'll be fine you can go again. i'm ok(he tries to avoid the  tweezers) dammit! woman!! how hoooow! 

CHANDLER:
 hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on  going?

ROSS:
 not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand  but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.

CHANDLER:
 well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i  mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,two  illegitimate children. the personal ad writes itself....

ROSS:
 that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again?

CHANDLER:
 what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!

ROSS:
 i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to  me

CHANDLER:
 maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just  an impulsive one-time birthday thing

ROSS:
 no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a  bar.

CHANDLER:
 did she go out with him?

ROSS:
 no. when he called, i...i threw the message away.

CHANDLER:
 ah! the high road...

ROSS:
 you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey  check out those two blondes over there!hey come with me!

CHANDLER:
 are you trying to get everybody divorced?

ROSS:
 you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the  two of us, like college, remember? you...you break theice with some kind of  jokes so that they know you're the funny one and i swoop in with some  interesting conversation, sothey'll see that i'm the brilliant, brooding,  sexy one...

CHANDLER:
 i thought i had to make the jokes!

ROSS:
 don't you have to be at work?

CHANDLER:
 oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend  ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. we only  need six more people for a human pyramid...swoop!! swoop!!

ROSS:
 hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the 

PAPER...ANOTHER FLOOD IN EUROPE? HERE’S A QUESTION:
 "would you...would you  rather drown or be burnt alive?"

BLONDE GIRL:
 sorry...we were just leaving

CHANDLER:
 we still got it!     

RACHEL:
 who is it?

GAVIN:
 gavin! i brought you some soup.

RACHEL:
 why?

GAVIN:
 i heard you were sick...

RACHEL:
 oh! right! yeah! hold on, i'll be just clean up in here a little  bit! hello gavin

GAVIN:
 i missed you at work today. how are you feeling?

RACHEL:
 i a not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick

GAVIN:
 oh! good! because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i  thought you called in sick to avoid me.

RACHEL:
 oh no no no

GAVIN:
 so i had fun last night

RACHEL:
 so did i

GAVIN:
 exactly how contagious is this thing you have? i mean is it a cold  for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?

RACHEL:
 it's just a cold

GAVIN:
 do you have fever? let me see. hum...

RACHEL:
 what? what's the matter?

GAVIN:
 what's ross doing to you on that picture?

RACHEL:
 oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be  funny.

GAVIN:
 right. right. ross. so what's the deal with you guys? i don't want  to get in the middle of anything

RACHEL:
 oh you're not. you're not gonna get in the middle of anything,  don't worry about ross really, really.(she hears the noise of the key in the  lock) oh! hide! that's ross! hide! hide!

GAVIN:
 yeah! but you said not to worry about...

RACHEL:
 i lied! and i'm not sick! just stay behind the curtain!

MOLLY:
 hi!

RACHEL:
 oh! molly! you're not ross.

MOLLY:
 no i'm here to take emma to your mother's, remember?

RACHEL:
 right, right, yes!

MOLLY:
 don't panic!

RACHEL:
 what?

MOLLY:
 there is a man behind your curtain. i have a mace in my  purse.

RACHEL:
 no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my  business associate gavin. he's just being silly.gavin come out from behind  that curtain!

GAVIN:
 hi! gavin! please to meet you. it was my idea to stand  there.

MOLLY:
 hello! i just go and get emma.

RACHEL:
 ok.

GAVIN:
 so hum...why did i have to hide?

RACHEL:
 i thought it was ross.

GAVIN:
 so what if it was? i thought there was nothing going on between  you two...

RACHEL:
 there isn't. there is totally isn't.

GAVIN:
 you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming  out of a chute for the first time. i used to be arodeo clown.

RACHEL:
 all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were  here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not inany relationship  but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus  there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...i don't know, i'm sorry,  i'm just all over the place.

GAVIN:
 it's ok. i know it's probably not my place but can i give you a  piece of advice?

RACHEL:
 yes

GAVIN:
 i think you should talk to ross about all this.

RACHEL:
 people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin

GAVIN:
 don't be. it's just bad timing.

RACHEL:
 so seriously...rodeo clown?

GAVIN:
 one of the best, ma'am, one of the best...     

PHOEBE:
 "no time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the  world...!" thank you! 

MIKE:
 oh she's my girlfriend. that's not just how we do it here. i got to  get a break and when we come back we've got kennethsinging "i touch  myself"...i'm not here to judge!

PHOEBE:
 hi hi...oh you have got to sing.

MONICA:
 no i told you i can't.

PHOEBE:
 but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice  voice.

MONICA:
 what have you heard me sing?

PHOEBE:
 all the time when you're cooking.

MONICA:
 what?

PHOEBE:
 yeah you're always singing "yummy yummy yummy, i've got love in  my tummy"

MONICA:
 yeah i do rock that one.

PHOEBE:
 ok so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up  there?

MONICA:
 just a little but...it's just so scary! i don't even know what i  would sing...

MIKE:
 well i've got a book around...

MONICA:
 "delta dawn"     

ROSS:
 hi! i could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace

WOMAN:
 you already hit on me an hour ago

ROSS:
 right, so that's a firm "no". i cannot believe this, i just keep  striking out.

CHANDLER:
 i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate,  you're asking women how they want to be killed

ROSS:
 this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the  one she wants and i'm gonna die alone.

CHANDLER:
 by drowning or...?!

MICHELLE:
 why would he break up with me?

HER FRIEND:
 i don't know sweetie.

MICHELLE:
 all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back.  i mean, am i so unlovable?

CHANDLER:
 well...

ROSS:
 i know!        

MIKE:
 all right, that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of  "i touch myself". coming up next we've got monicasinging "delta  dawn".

MONICA:
 wait wait! i can't sing in front of all these people.

PHOEBE:
 just pretend they're not even here! it's ok monica, when that  spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.

MONICA:
 hi! i'm monica and i'm gonna be singing "delta dawn""delta  dawn, what's that flower you have on? could it be a faded rose from days gone  by? ..."

PHOEBE:
 can you totally see through her shirt ?

MIKE:
 like an x-ray. bad day not to wear a bra.

MONICA:
 "to take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"     

JOEY:
 hey, i need your help.

CHANDLER:
 wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley  judd?

JOEY:
 look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my  eyebrows shaped

CHANDLER:
 i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!

JOEY:
 you may be a sissy but i'll still . all  right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they  don’t match!

CHANDLER:
 it’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!

JOEY:
 all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic  marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one soi don’t look stupid for my  pictures.

CHANDLER:
 ok. first of all, this is green!

JOEY:
 what the hell am i supposed to do!

CHANDLER:
 all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you  will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you.

JOEY:
 what, what.

CHANDLER:
 ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the  lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mineby plucking the eyebrows  of my father and his “business” partners.

JOEY:
 oh my god!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, well, i guess you don’t need my help victor  victoria!

JOEY:
 ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help,  but chandler i don’t know if i can take anymoreplucking. it hurts so  bad!

CHANDLER:
 oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my  gentle self-loathing touch.     

MONICA:
 "take me to the mansion in the sky-y". i am sorry, the song is  over. did you see me out there?

PHOEBE:
 every little bit of you!

MONICA:
 i can’t believe i did this. i can’t believe i'm singing for the  people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear thatone shouting “look at those  tips”! i mean, did i really help you get a lot of tips?

MIKE:
 sure.

PHOEBE:
 mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but...

MONICA:
 good? didn’t you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for  making me do this. that’s is the best gift ever.

MIKE:
 also a good gift? underwear.     

MICHELLE:
 thank you so much for letting me do this. public bathrooms  freak me out, i can't even pee, let alone doanything else.

ROSS:
 but, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it.

MICHELLE:
 it’s so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with  me, because it’s like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.

ROSS:
 uh-ah!

MICHELLE:
 no don’t worry, this is not some rebound thing. i am totally  over eric.

ROSS:
 . good choice ross.

RACHEL:
 oh, hey! hi, there you are, i’ve been looking for you  everywhere!

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am.

RACHEL:
 listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock.  so i was hoping you and i could have achance to kind of talk… somebody  here?

ROSS:
 oh, yeah, yeah that’s michelle.

RACHEL:
 who?

ROSS:
 oh, just this woman i’ve been seeing.

RACHEL:
 you’ve being seeing someone?

ROSS:
 yeah, didn’t i mention that? yeah, i mean, we haven’t being going  out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. i-i  mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. i thought it  wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.

MICHELLE:
 what are you taking amoxicillin for?

ROSS:
 how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look  through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, that’smy roommate, rachel.

RACHEL:
 hi, and i am also emma’s mother.

MICHELLE:
 ah, who is emma?

ROSS:
 i told you about my daughter.

MICHELLE:
 this is your daughter? i can be your new mummy!     

CHANDLER:
 and done!

JOEY:
 oh my god! i didn’t feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a  job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the  saloon

CHANDLER:
 thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?

JOEY:
 yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look  great! how you doing!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little  worried i was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to  be a little piece of chocolate.

JOEY:
 thank you so much.

CHANDLER:
 no problem.

JOEY:
 listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some  manly make up for it.

CHANDLER:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 comb my eyelashes.     

MONICA:
 ok, for my next song i think i’ll sing something a little more  upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointersisters “i am so excited”. and  make it bouncy!

PHOEBE:
 oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.

CHANDLER:
 i am sorry i am late. you’ll understand when you’ll see  joey.

MONICA:
 honey, you’re just in time, i’m about to sing another  song!

CHANDLER:
 really? in front of all this people?

MONICA:
 and they love me!

CHANDLER:
 oh my god!

PHOEBE:
 yes, she gives the people what they want.

MONICA:
 all right, watch!

MONICA:
 "tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll  put all other things aside. give in thistime and show me some  affection..."

CHANDLER:
 are those my wife’s nipples?

PHOEBE:
 oh? isn’t that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have  let her go up again.

CHANDLER:
 i gotta stop this.

MONICA:
 oh, who cares, they still love me! "i am so excited..."

CHANDLER:
 you, touching yourself, out!     

RACHEL:
 wow. she does that a lot!

MICHELLE:
 ross, you didn’t tell me you were a doctor!

RACHEL:
 what, what, wait a minute! you haven’t even told her you were a  doctor, yet? how long have you known her, likean hour?

MICHELLE:
 actually about an hour and a half.

ROSS:
 i told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection  between us.

MICHELLE:
 you feel that too? oh, i thought that was just me!

ROSS:
 are you kidding?

MICHELLE:
 hey, do you want to go away this weekend?

ROSS:
 we’ll see.

RACHEL:
 ok, ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange  women back to the apartment now?

ROSS:
 i don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?

RACHEL:
 how do you know about that?

ROSS:
 through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to  sleep...

MICHELLE:
 emma.

ROSS:
 when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a  guy you know, for what? a week?

RACHEL:
 oh, that’s what this is all about? did you bring her up here to  get back at me?

MICHELLE:
 no, actually, see i had to pee, ‘cause i can’t use public  bathrooms because the doodie parasites.

ROSS:
 ok, michelle, it’s time to go.

MICHELLE:
 well, call me!

ROSS:
 ok.

MICHELLE:
 no, wait, you don’t have my phone number!

ROSS:
 you know, if it’s meant to be, i’ll guess it. bye, bye.

RACHEL:
 score.

ROSS:
 oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we  could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.

RACHEL:
 oh god, i can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this.  it was one kiss, one guy, one time!

ROSS:
 oh, really!

RACHEL:
 yeah.

ROSS:
 oh, really!

RACHEL:
 oh yeah.

ROSS:
 what about the guy from the bar?

RACHEL:
 what? who?

ROSS:
 the guy you gave your number to.

RACHEL:
 whoa, how do you know about that?

ROSS:
 because he called here looking for you. so don’t tell me  this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? you’ve been  out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. and you didn’t even  have the courtesy to tell me.

RACHEL:
 why didn’t i get that message?

ROSS:
 what?

RACHEL:
 from the guy in the bar, why didn’t i get that message?

ROSS:
 because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you  not look there?

RACHEL:
 ross?

ROSS:
 i never gave it to you.

RACHEL:
 why?

ROSS:
 i don’t know.

RACHEL:
 oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to  decide what messages i should or should not get?

ROSS:
 who am i?

RACHEL:
 yes.

ROSS:
 i am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars  meeting guys!

RACHEL:
 oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in  here hoping to have a mature conversation with youabout us! but i can’t do  that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my  apartment!

ROSS:
 none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! that’s not the  point. ok? the point is you...you are the onewho moved on and didn’t tell  anyone!

RACHEL:
 oh, ross, this is just so messed up! what’s wrong with us? you  know when people hear about our situation theyalways ask, “what, you live  together but you’re not a couple? and you have a baby, isn’t that weird?» and i  say “no.you know what, it’s not, because it works for us!» but you know this  doesn’t work. in fact this is the opposite of working!

ROSS:
 uh, clearly.

RACHEL:
 and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as  long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,just doesn’t make sense  anymore.

ROSS:
 yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do?     

JOEY:
 hey!

RACHEL:
 hi. can emma and i live here for a while?

JOEY:
 ha, oh, of course.

RACHEL:
 thank you.

JOEY:
 your eyebrows look weird.
