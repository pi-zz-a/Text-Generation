ROSS:
 you said you’d marry joey?

RACHEL:
 okay you have to realize, i was exhausted, i was emotional, i would have said yes to anybody. like that time you and i got married!  i’m not helping.

ROSS:
 so you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?

RACHEL:
 that is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but i am prepared to let that go.

ROSS:
 so when i came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.

RACHEL:
 well—really? i thought chandler was your best friend.

ROSS:
 well, chandler’s my oldest friend, but joey’s my—no! ah! 

RACHEL:
 ooooo!

JOEY:
  hey you guys i’m gonna take off. i just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.

ROSS:
 rachel said she’d marry you?!

JOEY:
  this isn’t the right room, sorry folks.  opening credits  and rachel to come home and monica is looking at the sign phoebe bought that says, 

MONICA:
 ok, i don’t wanna be negative so i’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.

PHOEBE:
 no they ran out of "it’s a girl" but i can fix this one,  see?

MONICA:
  so sexy.  honey.

CHANDLER:
 yea yea. 

MONICA:
 honey why don’t you go lie down.

CHANDLER:
 no, no, ross and rachel will be back soon and then i gotta go to the office  am i producing them?

JOEY:
 why’re you so tired?

CHANDLER:
 couldn’t sleep last night you know, then i started worrying about this big divisional meeting that i have later today, the more i worried about it the more i couldn’t sleep.  y’know? i was like, if i fall asleep now i’ll get six hours sleep, but if i fall asleep now i’ll get five hours sleep. not matter what i did i couldn’t fall asleep.

JOEY:
 you know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.

RACHEL:
  hi!

EVERYONE:
 hi, welcome home!

MONICA:
 phoebe did the signs!

RACHEL:
 oh you guys thanks for doing this.

PHOEBE:
 look at all the stuff people sent!

RACHEL:
 oh ah!  oh my gosh there’s something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! what are people think…  oh you guys i love it.

JOEY:
 hey so where’s ross?

RACHEL:
 he’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.

JOEY:
 is he still mad at us?

RACHEL:
 well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. i mean, i just had his baby.

JOEY:
 that’s not fair! i can’t do that.

RACHEL:
 yeah, i’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.

JOEY:
 see this is what i was afraid of, i didn’t think i should be here either but somebody  said he’d be over it by now.

CHANDLER:
 hey, what do i know? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla. 

MS. MCKENNA:
 the numbers we are seeing new york, chicago, and london are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields. 

MS. MCKENNA:
 boston is down, atlanta is down, houston is down, i could go on and on but instead of boring you i’ll go straight to my forty two point plan. (chandler leans over to fall asleep on the man’s shoulder next to him, only the man catches his attempt.)

CHANDLER:
 walter .  

PHOEBE:
 she’s just so cute! i just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.

MONICA:
 phoebe! but i could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.

ROSS:
  okay i put most of the stuff away.

RACHEL:
 oh great, the pacifiers?

ROSS:
 in the closet.

RACHEL:
 the burping clogs?

ROSS:
 linen closet.

RACHEL:

ROSS:

PHOEBE:
 wow you guys got a hospital?  fancy!

ROSS:

RACHEL:
 alright thanks, oh ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?

ROSS:
 sure what kind?

RACHEL:
 umm let me think...what do i want, what d-o i w-a-n-t...

ROSS:
 please take your time, it’s an important decision. not like, say, i know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.

RACHEL:
 blueberry.

ROSS:
 blueberry it is.

RACHEL:
 thanks.

MONICA:
 wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?

RACHEL:
 god how long do you think that’s gonna last?

PHOEBE:
 i dunno, well he got over the "we were on a break" thing really quickly.

RACHEL:
 y’know i can’t even worry about that right now, cause i got the cutie little baby, oh i can’t believe how much i love her, i can’t get enough of her, like right now i miss her.  i actually miss her.

PHOEBE:
 you know that’s… that’s her.

RACHEL:
 oh god look at her sleeping.  oh, i love her so much!  oh, i think i’m gonna wake her up.

PHOEBE:
 oh no, rach, no no, you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.

RACHEL:
 well i can do whatever i want!  i made her!  come on little girl, hi! 

PHOEBE:
 i can say i told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.

RACHEL:
 oh i’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. shh.   shhh! go back to sleep 

MONICA:
 breaks your heart doesn’t it

PHOEBE:
 it really does… how long do you think we have to stay? 

MS. MCKENNA:
 ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, chandler, (walter puts his hand on chandlers hand, chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he then wakes up and pulls his hand away) chandler?

CHANDLER:
 yep.

MS. MCKENNA:

CHANDLER:
  yes.

MS. MCKENNA:

PHOEBE:
 well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! go back in time and listen to phoebe!

MONICA:
 alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.

RACHEL:
 ok. 

MONICA:
 it worked!

RACHEL:
 oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (emma starts crying again.) oh come on, what am i gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stop crying.

MONICA:
 umm, she rach, not it, she. 

RACHEL:
 yeah, i’m not so sure.

MONICA:
 oh my god, i am losing my mind.

PHOEBE:
 yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with ross! 

ROSS:
 hey gunther, can i get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (he puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)

GUNTHER:
 diapers huh?

ROSS:
 yep.

GUNTHER:
 so i guess rachel had you baby?

ROSS:
 yep, can you believe it?

GUNTHER:
 nope!  i still can’t believe she slept with you in the first place.

ROSS:
 huh? ooh  you mean like a… huh?

JOEY:
  hey. (ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it’s joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) ross, i know you’re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.

ROSS:
 ah actually we don’t.  

JOEY:
  fine, fine okay.  but i gotta say technically, i didn’t even do anything wrong.

ROSS:
  you didn’t do anything wrong?!

JOEY:
 i said i didn’t technically.

ROSS:
 okay let’s put aside that you  "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  "accidentally" proposed to rachel.

JOEY:
 look, can i just stop you right there for a second? when people do this  i don’t really know what that means. (ross just looks at him) you were saying?

ROSS:
 and i can even understand that you couldn’t tell rachel, but why couldn’t you tell me, huh? you had all day to and you didn’t.

JOEY:
 i know i should’ve.  "i’m sorry." 

ROSS:
 not using it right, joe. 

ROSS:
 i’m gonna go.

JOEY:
 no, come on ross!  look, ross, we have to get past this.

ROSS:
 give me the bag.

JOEY:
 no, look, i don’t know what else to do. i said i’m sorry!

ROSS:
 joey!

JOEY:
 you should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.

ROSS:
 i’m not gonna hit you.

JOEY:
 why not?  you’ll feel better!  i’ll feel better, and you know you want to. i can see it in your eyes.

ROSS:
 no i don’t.

JOEY:
 a little bit.

ROSS:
 no.

JOEY:
 little bit.

ROSS:
 no!

JOEY:
  a little bit more.

ROSS:
 give me the bag.

JOEY:
 no, hit me

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 joe i’m not kidding…

JOEY:
  hit me, hit me.

ROSS:
 no!

JOEY:
  hit me! hit me!  (ross throws a punch, but joey ducks and ross punches the pole. ross then screams from the pain and turns to gunther, and gunther has a huge smile on his face.)

ROSS:
 you ducked!!

JOEY:
 i’m sorry! it was a reflex! 

ROSS:
 oh my god, this really hurts!!!

JOEY:
 i couldn’t help it! when a fist comes at your face, you duck! look! (he goes to punch ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn’t and joey punches ross.   gunther is amused.)

ROSS:
 what is the matter with you?!?

JOEY:
 you were supposed to duck!!! why didn’t you duck?

ROSS:
 why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?

JOEY:
 good, good yeah,  maybe while we’re there, they can check your reflexes.  (makes quote marks.) "oops." commercial break 

MONICA:
 try feeding her again.

RACHEL:
 i already fed her.

MONICA:
 i know, that’s why i said again!

PHOEBE:
 alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, okay?  that’s just what she wants.

CHANDLER:
  hey.

MONICA:

CHANDLER:
 monica can i talk to you outside for a minute?

RACHEL:
 oh no, you guys, just stay here, i’m gonna go check her diaper, pheebs you wanna come?

PHOEBE:
 oh i’m kinda part of this.

CHANDLER:
 actually pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing

PHOEBE:
 i knew i should have married chandler. (phoebe and rachel go to the back room and emma continues to cry in the background while chandler and monica talk.)

MONICA:
 okay what’s up

CHANDLER:
 umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to paris for a year? you know, you could study french cooking and i could write and we could take a picnic along the seine and go wine tasting in bordeaux?

MONICA:
 oh yeah .

CHANDLER:
 okay, you know how that people say that tulsa is the paris of oklahoma?

MONICA:
 what? who says that?

CHANDLER:
 people who’ve never ever been to paris.

MONICA:
 what’s going on?

CHANDLER:
 we’re moving to tulsa! 

MONICA:
 excuse me?

CHANDLER:
 okay, ms. mckenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to tulsa and be the president of our office there, and i was sleeping and apparently, said yes.

MONICA:
  tulsa, oklahoma!

CHANDLER:
 the sooner state, whatever that is.

MONICA:
 chandler, i don’t even wanna see the musical oklahoma!

CHANDLER:
 really? oh what a beautiful morning!  surrey with a fringe on top.

MONICA:
 are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to oklahoma, or that you’re gay? all right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?

CHANDLER:
 no, no, but they are going to lease us a ford focus. (monica’s not impressed.) i’ll get out of it.

MONICA:
 thank you.

CHANDLER:
  what is wrong with emma?

MONICA:
 oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to tulsa. 

CHANDLER:
 umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  i kind of have some bad news. i don’t think i can move to tulsa.

MS. MCKENNA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 it’s a funny story, actually.  i kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when i said i’d move to tulsa, i didn’t really know what i was saying.

MS. MCKENNA:
 you fell asleep?

CHANDLER:
 but only because i was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? irony? not a fan, alright . see, here’s the thing. i went home and told my wife about tulsa and she won’t go. see, me, i love tulsa!  tulsa is heaven!  tulsa is italy—please don’t make me go there!

MS. MCKENNA:
 chandler, i…

CHANDLER:
 no no no! look, carol, can i call you carol?  wh-why would i when your name is elaine? oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (she glares at him.) that’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. i like a girl with a strong jaw. i’ll call you from tulsa.  

JOEY:
 hey, so how is it?

ROSS:
 i broke my thumb.

JOEY:
 your thumb? that’s weird.  you sure you’re punching right? make a fist.  maybe later. ross i feel terrible.

ROSS:
 you know what, you can go, i just have to fill out some forms. (tries to hold the pen but can’t)

JOEY:
 you, you want me to help you with that?

ROSS:
 why, does it look like i’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (he hands joey the form)

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:

JOEY:

ROSS:
 i don’t think that we are.

JOEY:
 but you two were supposed to be together.

ROSS:
 well, i thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.

JOEY:
 come on, ross, that didn’t mean anything! she just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.

ROSS:
 yeah that’s what she said.

JOEY:
 so?

ROSS:
 so i don’t wanna be just anybody.

JOEY:
 wow.

ROSS:
 you know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. i mean i don’t know what i was thinking, going down that road again with us. it’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.

JOEY:
 really?

ROSS:
 yeah.

JOEY:
 and you’re okay with that?

ROSS:
 yes. i mean, it’s what we always planned.  and if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  that’s why they call them plans.  hello?  i’m fine.

JOEY:
 hey, for what it’s worth, with rachel i don’t think you’ll ever be just  "anybody."

ROSS:
 hey there you go! 

JOEY:
  "thanks."  

RACHEL:

MONICA:

PHOEBE:
