 gunther: ha!
joey:  gesundheit
 hayley: i would love to go out with you.
joey: really, great, did i actually ask you?
 hayley: no that's just where you were going i just figured that i'd help   you out, you don't seem like the kind of guy that does this very a lot.
 gunther: ha!
joey:  seriously gunther you should see   someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could die! (gunther looks   scared)  
ross: so how'd the date go?
phoebe: well it was awful every time i thought about what   you said i started crying.
ross: so he hasn't called?
phoebe: would you call this girl?    thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
ross: now i feel terrible this is all my fault.
phoebe: well you not what you should feel terrible about,   this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. do you   know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
ross: we are a rare breed.  
 hayley: what a great dinner.
joey: yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that   last piece of cake at the restaurant.
 hayley:  your welcome again, i'm gonna make some coffee can i get   you anything?
joey: do you have any cake?  (hayley laughs and goes into the kitchen thinking it's a joke, joey doesn't   see what's so funny about it)  >>> joey's subconscious   so this is going pretty good. dinner was nice, got a lot in common. (sees a     magazine) victoria's secret huh we even like the same books. (walks over     to a painting on the wall) oh now there's a scary painting. wait a minute     i think i've been scared by that painting before.  you know     what this whole place look familiar i have definitely been in this apartment     i know i've seen this weird plant before      awch! it did that the last time. oh my god, i've gone out with this girl     before yeah we had sex on this couch and then on that chair and no. no we     didn't do it hear which is weird because it seems like a perfectly good place.
joey: (bends down to see and the cactus pricks him in the   ass) awch! that's why.  
ross:  hey mike sorry   to just drop by like this, can i come in?
mike: sure  who are you?
ross: i'm ross, phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.

ross: yeah i really, really need to talk to you about something.
mike: ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join   a cult are you?
ross:  no
mike: oh it's just you have that look 
ross: damn super cuts!
mike: what's up is phoebe ok?
ross: oh no yeah, no phoebe is great, but umm i'm an idiot   look right before you guys went out i accidentally got her all upset.
mike: that's why she was weird.
ross: yes, yeah i said something stupid about her never   having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,   a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
mike: i'm not blowing her off, i actually just got off the   phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, i mean i hope that's ok with   you stranger from the coffee house.
ross: well then i didn't need to bother you or the four   other mike hanagens i bothered.
mike: hey wait wait wait wait wait! is that true what you   said phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
ross: of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship   i'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
mike: but you did say it
ross: yes, yes i did. and i will also say what i'm about   to say vis-à-vis the following phoebe has never had a serious relationship   since her. super-serious relationship with. vicrum.
mike: vicrum?
ross: what that's a real name!  
chandler:  oklahoma where the wind comes   sweeping down the plane, stop it! why couldn't they have sent me to texas?   7 o clock maybe i'll hit the gym  who am i kidding pay-per-view   porn.  -cuts to monica (she's just arrived outside his room she   fixes a bent photo hanging on the wall then sprays mint in her mouth and enter)
chandler:" do not disturb do not disturb! monica: "
monica:": is everything all right?"
chandler: everything's great, just watching some regular   television there, what a pleasant surprise. (she hugs him, and she knows what   he was doing so she looks at the tv and sees sharks swimming around thinking   chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
monica:": i'm gonna go freshen up ok"
chandler: ok honey. that was close.  -cut to rachel 
rachel: hello
monica:": hey rach its me ok i just got the chandler's room   and i caught him molesting himself."
rachel: oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know   guys do that.
monica:": yea well the weird part is... he was getting off   to a shark attack show!"
rachel: nooooooooo!
monica:": yes! chandler watches shark porn!     "
rachel: well watching sharks? are you sure that's what he   was doing?
monica:": do you know how many times i've seen him jump up   like that, believe me i know what he was doing."
rachel: man sharks. i always knew there was something weird   about that dude. but you promised to love him no matter what.
monica:": what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone.   not if he gets his jollys to jaws!"
rachel: ah! you know what honey guys are just different,   they like things that we can't understand, you know i once dated this guy who   wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that   he unfroze from a block of ice.
monica:": eww are you talking about my bother."
rachel: yeah i didn't disguise that very well did i.
joey:  hey
rachel:  hi
joey: listen to this... i went out with this girl last night   and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her.  
rachel: so basically you've slept with all the woman in   new york and now you're just going around again.
joey: well that's not even the weird part. i don't think   she remembered sleeping with me.
monica:": but you don't remember sleeping with her."
joey: yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am   very memorable, you guys know.
rachel: what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
joey: and who's fault is that.
monica:": what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe   you were having an off night"
joey: hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes   when i'm a little bloated i don't feel very sexy but even then i'm better then   most!
monica:": honey why don't you just let it go and ask her   out again."
rachel: yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember   who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
joey: interesting. all right i'll go out with her again   and try to get past it  oh salt bloaty!
monica:": joey, joey."
joey: what?
monica:": you don't think sharks are sexy do you?"
joey: no.  wait a minute what was the little mermaid?    
phoebe: it's open.
ross: hey!
phoebe: hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay!   
ross: yay! (he continues the happiness with her by dancing   around) quick thing, i went to talk to mike.
phoebe: what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross!
ross: oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there   to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended   up telling him that.
phoebe: what!
ross: umm. that you had a six year long relationship with   a guy named vicrum.
phoebe: what! why?
ross: well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in   a serious relationship.
phoebe:  if you hadn't just had a baby   with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your   danglers right now!
ross: well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know   a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer  and he   used to date oprah. 
phoebe: i'm not going along with some lie you made ross,   no i'm just gonna be honest with him.
ross: good yeah just be honest with him.
phoebe: yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't   been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a   real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will   and that's ok. so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be. it'll   be fine. it'll be fine. i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh   
ross: i'll get it
phoebe: ok
mike:  you know i'm trying to think   of the last time i opened a door and you weren't there, phoebe are you ok?   
phoebe: uh huh yeah  there's just something umm,   there's something you should know  vicrum just called.  
 hayley: so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents,   a perfect couple getting divorced, i kinda took it the hardest cause i was   the youngest.
joey: uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me?
 hayley: what?
joey: how could you not remember that we slept together?
 hayley: what! when?
joey: i dunno!
 hayley: i really, really think i would remember sleeping with you
joey: come on, come on, search your brain all right. it   was  a certain amount of time ago, i was here you were here, we had   sex  here, here, here not there. anything?
 hayley: no it's not ringing any bells.
joey: my god woman! how many people do you have to had been   with not to remember any of this?
 hayley's roommate: hey hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. joey!
joey: ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember   me hey! i still got it.  so were good. (she just glares   at him) i'll let myself out.  
phoebe: .and i said vicrum you can't just call every time   you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel.
mike: but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross
phoebe: yeah well  yeah you know emma's birth certificate   might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee.
mike: that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
phoebe: i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you   know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
mike: i just think there's somebody better out there for   you,  i mean i'm not saying me but. maybe me.
phoebe: oh.
mike: and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with   me. although i do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway i just   think i can make you happy.
phoebe: ok i can't do this.
mike: what's wrong?
phoebe: well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because   i never really have been in a long-term relationship, i've never lived with   a guy, and i've never even celebrated an anniversary so.  if that's   too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand. in fact i'll close   my eye's make it less awkward (she sits with her eyes closed and mike kisses   her, phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) you kissed me.
mike: uh huh
phoebe: so you don't think i'm a total freak
mike: no. well look can i think your weird and also cool   for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
phoebe: i guess so, can i. can i think it's cool that you   kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and phoebe pulls   back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
mike: definitely
ross: (they kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it   up, its ross putting on an accent pretending to be vicrum) this is vicrum.   
chandler: hi honey i'm home!
monica:": hi, how was your flight? "
chandler: oh it was great.
monica:": here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable   because i.  have   a little surprise for you."
chandler: well, well, well it must be five in tulsa because   it's six o clock in ny.c!
monica:": ok  this is how much i love   you. "
chandler:  honey why am i watching   a bunch of sharks swimming around.
monica:": is this not the good part? do you want me to fast   forward to something a little toothier."
chandler: no i'm not quite sure you got the right movie   that's all.
monica:": oh well this is the only one they had at our video   store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. or does it always   have to be sharks?"
chandler: does what always have to be sharks.
monica:": honey look we can do something else, do you want   me to get into the tub and thrash."
chandler: what's going on?
monica:": sweetie it's ok, i still love you, let me be a   part of this."
chandler: let me be a part of this!
monica:": i saw what you were doing in tulsa. angry sharks   turn you on!"
chandler: no they don't
monica:": then why were you watching them and giving yourself   a treat."
chandler: oh my god! when you came in i switched the channel,   i was just watching regular porn
monica:": really?"
chandler: yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american   action.
monica:": i cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (they   hug)"
chandler: you are an amazing wife.  no really   you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, i mean where do you   find the strength and understanding over something like that.
monica:": im very, very drunk right now.     "
joey:  see ordinarily i would talk   to her, but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her? did i not sleep with   her?
 phoebe: you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your     whole dating attitude. your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious     relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you     go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience     never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
