joey:  hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
chandler:  well, let me see... i-i believe i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv.
joey: look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
chandler: i could fall asleep at a play.
phoebe: what is it?
joey:" it's a one-woman play called ""why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life""."
monica: it sounds interesting!
ross: yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, i don't think it gets bett... 
phoebe: i know, i know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
joey: you guys are gonna have a great time, i promise!
ross: what? how come that you don't have to go!
joey: i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
chandler:  uh, let's see, who do i hate?
rachel:  oh, sorry... oops, sorry.
joey:  hey, here you go.
rachel: ooh... oooh...  can i ask you a question?
monica: yeah.
rachel: do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
monica: no, i don't think it ever works. why?
rachel: no reason.
monica: no, no, rachel?
rachel: yeah
monica: who do you wanna fool around with?
rachel:  nobody, forget it!  maybe.
monica:  you can't!
rachel:  seriously i did not understand a word that you said.
monica: in the hall. 
monica: you wanna fool around with joey?
rachel: yeah! you know, ever since i had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! and what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
monica: who? who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
rachel: ok, off the top of my head... don and janet.
monica: who, who are they?
rachel: i know them from work.
monica: both of them?
rachel: no, one of them...
monica: which one?
rachel: i don't know, what were the names i just said?
monica: rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
rachel: all right, all right, you're right, i won't do anything with joey, i just thought that we 
monica: what the hell are you cooking! opening credits
ross: hey!
monica: hey!
chandler: hey!
ross: hey, you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today.
chandler: yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
ross:  there're these two professors who are joining my department and i have to meet them here and show them around campus.
monica: what's so bad about that?
ross: it's i just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
monica:" : ross?"
ross:  these aren't suede.  excuse me, i'm looking for someone. you don't, by any chance, know a ross geller?
gunther: no.
ross: hi, hi, i'm ross geller.
charlie: oh, hi. i'm professor wealer.
ross: oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
charlie: it's a... it's good to meet you! thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
ross: oh, no, it's no big deal, i mean, if i weren't doing this i'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
monica:  is he gonna introduce us?
chandler:  no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
charlie: and, by the way, i really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
ross: oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute.
monica:  twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
ross:  we should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
charlie: oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
ross: i don't think so.
charlie: i'm pretty sure, professor spafford from cornell?
ross:" oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"".  shall we?"
charlie: you don't think we should wait for him?
ross: you know what, he's a big boy, i'm sure he'll find us, ok?
professor spafford: professor geller?
ross: oh, damn it!   hi joey it's jane rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. listen, i forgot your address, can you give me a call? thanks, bye.
joey:  hey!
rachel: hey!
joey: what's happenin'?
rachel: yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
joey: oh, i'd love to, but i gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
rachel: oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... 
message:" ""hi joey, it's jane rogers can't wait for your party tonight"" "
joey:  stupid jane rogers!!
rachel:  you are having a party tonight??
joey: kinda have a... a thing for the days of our life's people.
rachel: and you weren't going to tell us? how did you think you were gonna get away with that?
joey: i do it every year.
rachel: you do that every year??
joey: i didn't have to tell you that!! i'm stupider than jane rogers!!
rachel: oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
joey: yeah...
rachel: and last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
joey: yeah...
rachel: oh! and the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
joey:  i can't believe you guys went for that one!
rachel: joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
joey: you're fine, ok? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
rachel: well, then so you just invite me...!
joey:  please, i was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
rachel: oh, joey, come on! please, please! let me come, i will behave, i promise! i will behave! please, please, please...
joey: ok, ok! fine! you can come, but don't tell anybody else. it's up on the roof at 8.
rachel:  and it's out of my system! 
professor spafford:  and then my wife and i went on a cruise to the galapagos. there was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. there were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. it's a pity i'm allergic to shellfish.
ross:  so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
professor spafford: and that's not all i'm allergic to.
ross:  oh, it's not over!
professor spafford: i'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
ross: so basically all nuts?
professor spafford: interestingly... no.
charlie:" kinda playing fast and loose with the word ""interesting""."
professor spafford: if you'll excuse me i'm going to use the restroom. 
charlie: oh my god!!
ross: i've lost the will to live.
charlie: let's ditch him!
ross: what?
charlie: come on, he's still in the bathroom! i'm begging you!
ross: oh... ok, fine. but... ehm... i just have one question for you, ehm...  when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
charlie: stop it, stop it! he talks slow but he might pee fast! ok, let's go!!  
ross:  oh, hey you guys! this is charlie! charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica.
phoebe: hi!
ross: yeah, charlie is gonna be joining my department.
phoebe: oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  oh, ok, now, what do you think of ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
charlie: well, i think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
phoebe: ah, ah.
charlie: 
ross:  ranion's theory of species variegation?
phoebe: yeah, i saw the article on your coffee table and i memorized the title to freak you out!
monica:  so, did you two have fun?
ross: oh my god, she's great! i mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
monica: and i don't know if you've noticed but she's a  hi!
rachel:  hey... hi you guys! listen, you know what? i'm not feeling really well. i think i can't get out for the play.
ross: really? wh-what's wrong?
rachel: i don't know! i think it's kind of serious! oh, you know... i was watching this thing on tv this morning about... newcastle disease... and i think i might have it!!
charlie: oh, newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
rachel: ... ok, who is this?
ross: i'm sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she's a collegue.
rachel: oh, hi! i would check your hand but... i'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
monica: hey, rachel, can-can i see you for a sec?
rachel: sure!  oh...
monica: you're not sick!
rachel: what? yes, i am!
monica: ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??
rachel: when you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! 
monica: you just wanna stay home so you can make a move on joey!
rachel: oh, no, no! i heard you before, that is so not what this is!
monica: ok, what is this?
rachel: ok!  joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
monica:  what?
ross:  wh-what's going on?
monica: joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof!
rachel: and he didn't want you guys to know about it but i came over here to tell you!!
charlie: i thought you came to say you were sick.
rachel: ok professor or detective?
phoebe: joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
rachel: yeah, and he does it every year! that's why he's sending you to that play! that's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
phoebe: and that horrible museum tour!
ross: no, i arranged that...  hey you guys, i'm turning in. have fun.
phoebe: we know about your party joey.
joey: what party?
monica: the game's over! take off your robe!
joey:  ok... i mean...
everyone: no!! cover it up!!
joey:  
joey:  thanks for coming.
monica: oh my god! kyle lowder!
kyle lowder: 
monica:  i love you!
joey: hey, that's why i didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
monica: oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
phoebe: hey!
monica:  oh my god, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? i can barely control myself.
phoebe: monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where is chandler anyway? 
monica:  oh my god! chandler! 
chandler: where the hell is everybody?
 why don't you like me?! chapter one: my first period. 
monica:"  hey! joey said no autographs! but if she's gettting one, then i want one too: to monica. and none of this ""best wishes"" crap. i want ""love""."
rachel: ok actually mon, matthew was just giving me his phone number.
monica: oh man! if i had known i was coming to this party i never would have gotten married!
matthew ashford: it was nice to meet you rachel.
rachel: nice to meet you.
matthew ashford: call me.
rachel: ok  we will!!
monica:  look at you with all the guys!
rachel: yeah!
monica: i guess you have forgotten all about joey?
rachel: yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly you've forgotten about chandler!
monica: please... chandler is the love of my life...   so, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston, huh?
charlie: actually, i'm kinda happy to be leaving... i just broke up with someeone.
ross: ooh... so sad... still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?
charlie: actually, alby is the guy i broke up with.
ross: you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
charlie: yeah...
ross: ... and you called him alby!?  i mean that's like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby...
charlie: yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
ross: eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
charlie: yes! and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
ross:"  oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""access hollywood""."
charlie: ok, you want the dirt? alby was seriously insecure. i mean, he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him.
ross: who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
charlie: a guy who won two.
ross:  two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart
charlie: yeah... for three years.
ross: oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the nobel prize?
charlie: ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend billy.
ross: oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?
charlie: no, but he did just win the mcarthur genius grant.
ross: huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine? 
phoebe: hey ross!
rache: how is it going with charlie?
ross:  oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
phoebe: oh, what's the matter?
ross: she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
rachel: i always loved that!!
ross: of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god!
phoebe: worse?
ross: oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  oh, you... you like that?
phoebe: 
ross: what? 
rachel: come on! i think this is funny!  
bitter lady:" well, i bet you are all thinkin' ""now would be a really great time for an intermission"", huh?"
chandler:  oh yes, god yes!!
bitter lady:  how could he leave me?!?!
chandler: i... i don't know... you seem lovely. 
joey: hey ross, this is one of my co-stars, dirk. 
ross: nice to meet you.
dirk: hey! so what show are you on?
ross: oh, i'm no actor, i'm a professor of palaeontology.
joey: it's a science.
dirk:" oh! hey well listen, i play a scientist on ""days"". and my character has just won the nobel prize."
joey: hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
ross: oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
dirk: hey, i got a 690 on my sats.
ross: i'd lead with that. .
joey: monica!
monica: don't worry joe, i won't come next year!  what have you got there?
ross: just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
joey: ah, let me see!  damn, that's a lot of guys! are you a little slutty?
rachel:  i think i am.
joey: . and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and i don't feel any different.  pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
rachel:  why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
joey: nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
rachel: joey, you're so sweet.
joey: that's true. but you know what, it doesn't matter because i already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
rachel: who ?
joey: me.
rachel:  really?
joey: yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
rachel: oh! screw it, i didn't get it! 
joey: gotcha.
rachel: oh, very funny... joey.  so, how did you enjoy the play?
monica: oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry.
chandler: well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
monica: you really liked it?
chandler:" oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because as a man i've been trained  but after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", i was uplifted."
monica: oh really!
chandler: oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!
monica: no!
chandler: did somebody sign your bra?
monica: so i got it when i was 13... 
phoebe: hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper?
ross: it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
phoebe: go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average joe phd.
ross: yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited.
phoebe: you're so much more than just brains! you're sweet, and kind, and funny...
ross: and sexy.
phoebe: ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
ross: yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her.
phoebe: good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch!
ross: stop going through my stuff !  hey!
monica: hey!
rachel:" i just wanted to let you know i've changed my mind: i'm gonna do it, i'm gonna kiss joey."
monica: no, you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea.
rachel: please, what about you and chandler?
monica: that's different! i was drunk and stupid!
rachel: well hello !
monica: what about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? why don't you just kiss one of them?
rachel: i could, i could but i don't want to! i want to kiss joey!
monica: alright . i think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
rachel:  i'm gonna do it.
monica: and i can't stop you.
rachel: no.  hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?
ross: i'm smarter than him! closing credits
phoebe: hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler.
chandler: oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you.
monica: oh, you're so wonderful.
bitter woman:" why don't you like me! chapter one: my first period."
