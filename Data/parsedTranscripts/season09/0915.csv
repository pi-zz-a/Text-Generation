chandler|  guys, guys, i've got great news! guess what… 
joey| uh, ah, monica's pregnant?! 
monica|  let's get past the moment. 
phoebe| what's your news? 
chandler| thank you. i got a job in advertising.  
monica|  oh, honey, that's incredible! 
phoebe|  
chandler| actually, it pays nothing. it's an internship. 
joey| oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'.  
chandler| right. so, it'll be the same except… less sex with you.  
ross| so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? 
chandler| well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. 
phoebe|  that's great. 
chandler| yeah, i mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating    
chandler|  humiliating and noble!   
ross| you know, if i didn't already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising. 
monica|" ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?"" "
ross| yes, i did, i did!  i should have written it down!  opening credits   
joey|  hey! 
monica| hey! 
joey| where's chandler? i wanna wish him good luck on his first day.  
monica| he just left. 
joey|  
rachel|  joey! you never gonna believe it: she called.  
joey|  she did? 
rachel|  you got it! 
joey|  i did? 
monica| what is she talking about? 
joey| i don't know, but it sounds great.  
rachel| your agent called. you got that audition. 
joey| with lennart haze? 
rachel| yes. 
joey| oh my god, that is great! that is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time. 
monica| is it a good play? 
joey| well, it must be, because i read and i didn't understand a singe word.  
rachel| yeah, and lennart haze is starring in it… 
joey| yeah, yeah, and directing. 
monica|  he was so good in that movie of macbeth.  
rachel|  you saw that? 
monica| no, but… i saw the previews. they played it right before jackass. 
rachel and joey|  ah! 
joey| yeah, he's done some amazing works. 
rachel| oh, yeah. oh, i loved him in those cell phone commercials.  
joey|  
monica| hey! maybe the monkey will be at the audition! 
joey|  don't make me more nervous than i already am!    
chandler|  good morning, everybody. 
intern| can i get you a cup of coffee, sir? 
chandler| oh, no, no, i'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that i can rent a car. 
intern| seriously, you're an intern? 
chandler| yeah, well, i'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom. 
intern|  dude! 
chandler| right. look, i know i'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope     
chandler| the comedian? uso?! 
intern|  uhm, it's usa, sir.      
receptionist| this is joey tribbiani. joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is lennart haze.     
joey| it is so amazing to meet you.  i'm such a big fan of your work. 
lennart| well, i've… i've been blessed with a… a lot of great roles.  
joey|" tell me about it! ""unlimited nights and weekends!""  "
lennart| you making fun of me? because i am not a sell-out.  i didn't do that for the money, i believe in those phones. i almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service. 
joey| no, i-i-i wasn't making fun of you, honestly, i-i think you were great in those commercials.  
lennart| really? 
joey| yeah. 
lennart| well, i do bring a certain credibility to the role. 
joey|  are you kiddin'? when they shoot you out of that cannon… 
lennart|" peeeeeooooooooch  ""hang up that phone!"" one take! "
joey| wow! 
lennart| so, shall we read? 
joey| oh, yah, sure. 
lennart| top of act two. this is my entrance. you got it?    
lennart|" ""what the hell are you still doing here""?   "
joey|" err, ""i think you know"".  "
lennart|" ""bastard""! "
joey|" ""i am what you made me. you know what? i could go right now."" "
lennart|" ""go, go!"" "
joey|" ""i can't. oh, i want to, long pause, but i can't."" "
lennart|" i'm sorry, sorry. you're not supposed to say ""long pause"" "
joey|  
lennart| no. thank you so much for coming in. we appreciate it, thank you.  
joey|" ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? i could do it with an accent, you know, southern  ""i could go right now, maaan!"" "
lennart|  my god in heaven.    
producer #1| joey, hang on for a second. lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?   
lennart| you, you gotta be kidding. see, h-he, he can't act. .    
lennart| hey! i-i-i don't care if he's hot, you know. if you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  this is a play. no, listen: if you insist on this, i will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think i'm next door.   
joey|  you should, please, just gimme another chance. i really wanna get better, please.  
lennart| well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. ready? 
joey| yeah. 
lennart| uhm, you're in your head. you-you're thinking way too much.  
joey| i really doubt that.  
lennart|  no, no, no. it's that you're not connected with anything in your body. there's no urgency. the scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. also, what you did was horizontal. don't be afraid to explore the vertical. and don't learn the words. let the words learn you.    
joey|  couldn't i just sleep with the producer?    
phoebe| hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? 
ross| oh, i can't. i've got a date with that waitress, katy, yeah, i know we've been only going out like twice, but i have a really good feeling about her.  
phoebe| oh, i hear divorce bells.    
mugger| alright. just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.  
ross|  what? 
mugger| i have a gun  
ross| o-ok. just relax, phoene, just stay calm. . oh my god, i can't find my wallet.    
mugger| alright, lady, now give me your purse! 
phoebe| no. 
ross|"  what do you mean ""no""? i knew you'd be my death, phoebe buffay.    "
phoebe| lowell, is that you? 
lowell| phoebe?  oh my god! 
phoebe|  oh my god!    
phoebe|  i'm sorry, ross, this is my old friend lowell from the streets. lowell, ross. 
lowell| ross, nice to meet you.   
ross| yeah, a real pleasure. 
phoebe| ah, it's been so long, so long.  i can't believe you're still doing this! 
lowell| ough, i know, but i quit smoking! 
phoebe| good for you!  
lowell| so you look like you're doing really well! i guess you're mugging days are behind you? 
phoebe| ouh…  
ross|  oh my god. phoebe, you used to mug people?  
phoebe| excuse me, ross, old friends catching up…    
monica| hey, how did the audition go?  
joey| well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, lennart haze did not like me.   
monica| what happened? 
joey| well, he said i wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical. oh, and he said that i should think less. 
monica| so far so good!  
chandler|  honey, i'm old! 
monica|  what's wrong? 
chandler| i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them. 
monica| so you're a little older. try to look at the positive: you have all this life experience. 
chandler| yes, but i don't think life experience with these.  
joey| wooooooooow  it's like they're on fire! 
monica| what are they?  
chandler| they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. 
joey|  i give you $ 500 for them! 
chandler| what am i supposed to do with these? 
monica| ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time. 
chandler|" well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and i think i heard somebody say ""slorps"".  would you help me try to sell these? "
monica| okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?  
chandler| no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.  
joey| hey, that'd work on me! why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords?     
all| hey, hey! 
ross| hey, you'll never guess what just happened… phoebe and i got mugged! 
monica| you okay?! 
ross|  yah, because phoebe knew the mugger!  
monica|  how do you know a mugger? 
phoebe| i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us.  
ross| you wanna know how she knew him?  because phoebe used to mug people.  
monica|  seriously? 
phoebe| well, i'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i… 
monica|  phoebe, that is awful! 
phoebe| well, ok, i wasn't rich like you guys, ok, i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer… 
monica| you're mother killed herself! 
phoebe| she was a drug dealer! 
ross| well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because  i was about to do some serious damage!  
phoebe|  okay… 
monica| well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, ross. 
phoebe| why? 
monica| well, ross was mugged as a kid. 
phoebe|  you were? 
ross| yeah, it was pretty traumatic. i was outside st. marc's comics… you know, i-i-i was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-  
monica|  wonderwoman! 
ross|" anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone…  … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: ""gimme your money, punk!"" "
phoebe|  oh my god… 
ross|" i know! and-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book: ""science boy"" "
monica| oh yeah! what was his superpower again? 
ross| a superhuman thirst for knowledge. 
monica| that's it.  
ross| well, i-i better get to class  are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way, phoebe? 
phoebe| no… actually, you might wanna stay away from jane street… that's where stabby joe works.    
phoebe| okay, i think we have a problem here.  
monica| what? 
phoebe| well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marc's comics.  
monica| yeah? 
phoebe| well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.  
monica| so? 
phoebe| well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- 
phoebe and monica|" ""geology rocks!""  "
monica| oh my god! 
phoebe| i know… i mugged ross!     
receptionist| you're late! 
joey|  i know, i'm sorry, but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom? 
receptionist| no, lennart doesn't wait! 
joey| but i'm bursting with u-hu! 
lennart|  joey! here we go. let's go very quickly! 
joey| actually, i really need… 
lennart|  we must go now, quickly, please. 
joey| yes… ahahaaa  
lennart|" ready? ""what the hell are you still doing here?"" "
joey|"  ""i think you know!""  "
lennart|" ""oh, you sick bastard!"" "
joey|" ""i am what you made me! you know what?"" "
lennart|" ""what?"" "
joey|" ""i could go right now.""  "
lennart|" ""then go, go!"" "
joey|"  ""i, oh, i can't. i want to, but i can't!"" "
lennart| cut! that was good.  that was very good. you did everything i asked for.  
joey|  i did?  
lennart| yes. plus… what you've got that… i don't know what you've got going… this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that i couldn't've even imagined. wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but – you know what? – more, more. can you do that? 
joey| sure, yeah. i don't have time to say thank you because i really gotta go.  
lennart|  look at that: still in character, i like it… i plant seeds i can't explain.    
monica| hey! 
chandler| hey! 
monica| what are you doing? 
chandler| putting on the sneakers… thought i'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything… 
rachel| oh, anything yet? 
chandler| yes, how's this: they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!   
joey|  hey! 
all| hey!    
joey| probably wanna know what i'm doing…? 
monica| no, that seems about right. 
joey| yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. i got a call-back, so i'm drinking everything. oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great! 
rachel| joey, that was formula. 
joey| we gotta get more of that.  
chandler|  you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren. 
rachel| okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph.  
chandler| alright  i feel youger already!    
chandler|  yah, i think i broke my hip.    
phoebe|  hey, you! 
ross| hey! 
phoebe| hey, how was class? 
ross| no one ever asked me that, what's wrong?  
phoebe| nothing, i really wanna know. 
ross| oh…  well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene… 
phoebe|  alright, nothing is worth this. uhm, i have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid… 
ross|  wh-what are you talking about? it wasn't a girl. it was this huge dude. 
phoebe| you don't have to lie anymore, ross, i know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. 
ross| no, it wasn't. 
phoebe| yes, it was.  
ross| no, it wasn't. you don't think i would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old… 
phoebe|"  ""gimme your money, punk!"" "
ross|  oh my god, it was you! i can't believe it, you… you mugged me?  
phoebe|  i mean, well, it's just that i i've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and i have… have a great one!  
ross| it's not the best! 
phoebe| i know, i'm sorry, please forgive me. i don't know what to say… 
ross|  there's nothing you can say. that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.  
phoebe| really? even more humiliating than… 
ross|  hey, let's not do this!       
intern| … and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other! 
boss|  chander… 
chandler| okay…  you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he's about my age… 
intern|  your age? 
chandler|" a-huh. so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""not suitable for adults!""  "
boss| chandler, that's great!  
chandler| oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me  
boss| you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's….  you did you come up with that? 
chandler|  i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow. 
boss| that is great. good work!  chandler. thank you.  
boss| see all of you tomorrow.    
chandler| the cold weather hurts my hip!    
phoebe| hey, ross!  i know you're still mad at me, but can i just talk to you for a second?  
ross| sure, go ahead. whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.  
phoebe| i just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting.     
ross|   
phoebe| look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell… or smoke.  
ross| oh my god.  it's all here. what made you save it all these years?  
phoebe| i can't say, i just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.  
ross|" you really thought ""science boy"" was worth saving!  "
phoebe| yeah… but you should know, i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.  
ross| still… this is amazing… oh my god, thank you, phoebe.  
phoebe|" you're welcome. and thank you for ""science boy"". i learned a lot from him  "
ross| you're welcome.     
joey|"  ""i need an answer!"" "
lennart|" ""i-i-i can't tell you somethin' i don't know."" "
joey|" ""you know!"" "
lennart|" ""i don't know!"" "
joey|" ""i need an answer now!""  "
lennart|" ""alright, here, you want an answer… the answer… is…""    "
joey|  oh! 
lennart|" ""she never loved me, she only loved you."" "
joey|" ""you knew this all along and you never told me? you never told me? i can never forgive you, i can never forgive myself, i have nothing to live for – bang – end scene!"" "
lennart| absolutely amazing!  the part is yours.  
joey|  oh thanks, thanks! now, i really have to get… 
lennart| wa-wa-wa-wait! congratulations! you did it! you did it!  you can relax now. yeah.    closing credits   
monica| wow, that's a big cable bill! huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a saturday afternoon?!  i was in the house!  
ross|  hey, uhm, phoebe didn't by any chance mention that… 
monica| … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? yah.  
ross| i see. you didn't happen to tell… 
monica| … everybody we know? yeah.
