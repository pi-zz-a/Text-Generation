MONICA:
 it's so weird, how did joey end up kissing charlie last night?    i thought you'd end up kissing charlie.

ROSS:
 hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise!

CHANDLER:
 i missed most of the party  charlie's a girl, right?

ROSS:
 yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did    not kiss.

RACHEL:
 i don't know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls    at the party, god!

ROSS:
 why do you care so much?

MONICA:
 yes rachel, why do you care so much?

RACHEL:
  be-cause ross is the father of my child! you know...    and i... want him to hook up with lots of women!  i just... all i'm saying    is... i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common.

ROSS:
 oh, i don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each    other's tonsils...

PHOEBE:
 wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids    and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh,    those nerds will get laaaaaid!

RACHEL:
 all right, so... ross, you're ok with all this? i mean...

ROSS:
 yeah, it's no big deal. i mean, i just met her and i'm fine with    it...  

  ROSS:
 oh, god. i forgot how hot she was!

JOEY:
 hey!

ALL:
 hi!

ROSS:
 i'm gonna get some more coffee.

CHARLIE:
 oh, you know what? i'll come with you!

ROSS:
 ok. 

CHANDLER:
  so, a professor, uh?

JOEY:
 yeah! she is cool, and she's so smart! her mind is totally acrimonious     that's not    how she used it...?

CHARLIE:
  i feel like i owe you an explanation. i don't    ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. i'm... well, i'm kind of embarrassed.    i really hope you don't think less of me.

ROSS:
 uhm no! think less of you! no, i don't think less of you. i mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like    someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people.

CHARLIE:
 you know, actually i'm a little surprised to myself. i mean,    joey is so different from the guys i usually date. i mean, they're all professors,    and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you    know, very cerebral...

ROSS:
 yeah, i know the type.

JOEY:
 hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.    no? am i getting close? opening credits 

PHOEBE:
  hey!

MONICA:
 hey!

PHOEBE:
 hey you guys! look what i just got. (she shows them a pair of    slippers)

RACHEL:
 oh, oh! wow, i love those! where did you get them?

PHOEBE:
 i bought them off ebay! they used to belong to the late shania    twain.

RACHEL:
  phoebe, shania twain is still alive!

PHOEBE:
 oh... then i overpaid. 

MONICA:
 hey, what's this?

RACHEL:
 oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho.

MONICA:
 oh, you can't show phoebe this! she hates those corporate massage    chains.

RACHEL:
 ah, why, now i can't get a massage? there are so many things    that she disapproves of! i can't eat veal, i can't wear fur, i can't go hunting...

MONICA:
 do you wanna go hunting?

RACHEL:
 well, i would like to have the option!!

PHOEBE:
  what's up? (she sees the gift    certificate in rachel's hands) hey, rachel!!

RACHEL:
 oh!

PHOEBE:
 no, you can't go there! you know how i feel about these "big    massage places"! they're putting people like me out of business!

MONICA:
 and she wants to go hunting, too!!

RACHEL:
 phoebe, come on, i don't wanna waste it! it would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks!

PHOEBE:
 ok, this is not about the money, ok? it's about... it's    about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.

RACHEL:
 i don't care about any of that!!

PHOEBE:
 well, do you care about friendship?

RACHEL:
 oh!

PHOEBE:
 i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, don't use    this gift certificate. i'm asking you as a friend.

RACHEL:
 oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i won't use it!

PHOEBE:
 promise?

RACHEL:
 i promise.

PHOEBE:
 thank you. 

RACHEL:
 but i am going hunting!! 

MONICA:
  hey honey! i missed you today!

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah?

MONICA:
 yeah.  what d'you wanna do tonight?

CHANDLER:
 oh, well... maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the    table and wordlessly invites monica to have sex on it)

MONICA:
 ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience!    besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.

CHANDLER:
 we really need to take those tests?

MONICA:
 honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests.

CHANDLER:
 but i don't wanna do it in a cup!

MONICA:
 what is the big deal?

CHANDLER:
 it's weird! in a doctor's office?

MONICA:
 it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a taco bell?

CHANDLER:
     and in my defense, it was a wendy's!

MONICA:
 look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think    it's a good idea!

CHANDLER:
 yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the hershey's factory!

MONICA:
  oh!

CHANDLER:
 oh, yeah! rachel talks too! 

JOEY:
  who says that wine has to cost    more than milk!  

JOEY:
 heeey!

CHARLIE:
 hi!

JOEY:
 come on in, how are ya?

CHARLIE:
 i'm good!

JOEY:
 can i offer you a drink?

CHARLIE:
 please, i've been crazed all day! i had a meeting with    the dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and i'm writing the foreword    for a friend's book...

JOEY:
 uh-oh. i hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today i had to    open a door and go  ohhhh!

CHARLIE:
 so i am just so excited to be    here. and i can't wait to start exploring the city!

JOEY:
 hey, if you need a tour guide... 

CHARLIE:
 oh, you mean it? that would be so fun!

JOEY:
 yeah, definitely, definitely. ok, what do you wanna see first?

CHARLIE:
 oh, well, we can go see the chronos quartet at the avery fisher    hall.

JOEY:
  ok!

CHARLIE:
 and there is a collection of walt whitman letters on display    at the public library.

JOEY:
 i know, yeah!

CHARLIE:
 and first, i have to see the met!

JOEY:
 ok, let me stop you right there. the mets suck, ok? you wanna    see the yankees.

CHARLIE:
 no, no, no, not the mets, the met, singular!

JOEY:
 which one, they all suck!

CHARLIE:
 the museum!

JOEY:
  i don't think so. 

RACHEL:
  hi there!

RECEPTIONIST:
  hello, welcome to lavender day spa    spa. how may i help you?

RACHEL:
 oh, hi. i have a massage appointment under rachel green, and    here is my gift certificate.

RECEPTIONIST:
 this has been torn up.

RACHEL:
 and... taped back together.

RECEPTIONIST:
 ok well, i'll call you as    soon as your massage therapist is ready.

RACHEL:

RECEPTIONIST:

RACHEL:
  through the glass doors.

RECEPTIONIST:
 through the glass doors.

RACHEL:
 alright-y then.  

RECEPTIONIST:
 phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.

PHOEBE:
 ok. do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (she    sees rachel) oh, no, no! listen, is there someone    who can fill in for me?

RECEPTIONIST:
 sorry, everyone is booked!

PHOEBE:
 but that woman can't know i work    here. she's a friend of mine and i made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are.

RECEPTIONIST:
 then why you work here?

PHOEBE:
 'cause it's good money! but that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!

RECEPTIONIST:
 well, i think this is a great place to work!

PHOEBE:
  ok, are they listening?   

JOEY:
 ross!

ROSS:
 hi!

JOEY:
 i need to talk to you about charlie.

ROSS:
  oh, do you, do you really?

JOEY:
 yeah, i'm... i'm kind of having a little problem.

ROSS:
 look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"    means, just don't use it!

JOEY:
 no, look, you know charlie, right? she's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo...

ROSS:
 get to the problem!

JOEY:
 yes. it's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls i've    ever dated! combined! i don't want her to think i'm stupid!

ROSS:
  are you wearing two belts?

JOEY:
  eh, what do you know!

ROSS:
 you were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.

JOEY:
 right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and i don't know how to talk about that stuff. you gotta help me out!

ROSS:
 you know, i really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship.

JOEY:
 please, c'mon, you're the smartest person i know and i really    like this girl, ok, i don't wanna lose her.

ROSS:
  fine.

JOEY:
 thanks.

ROSS:
 ok. let's see. oh, you should take her to the met!

JOEY:
 the metsss!

ROSS:
 oh, no! the met! the metropolitan museum of art.

JOEY:
  you know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the muse! you know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!

ROSS:
 yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!

JOEY:
 ok, all right, so i'll take her to the met.

ROSS:
 yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on madison avenue. you know what? she loves architecture,    you know what you should do? you should take a walk down fifth to the    saint patrick's cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love.

JOEY:
 geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!

ROSS:
 but i'm not! . you know what if you're in the mood for    thai food...

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, whoa! slow down, you go way too    fast. ok? just go back to the met, ok?

ROSS:
 ok.

JOEY:
 you got to tell me exactly what to do there.

ROSS:
 ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing. ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire.

JOEY:
 whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! so, i walk in the door and make    the right (and he bends his arm to the left. ross then bends joey's arm to the    right and joey nods) 

CHANDLER:
 i have a weird feeling about this place.  how do i    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.

MONICA:
 because, honey, i mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that. 

NURSE:
 mr. bing?  here you are! you'll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container.

CHANDLER:
 deposit my specimen? you know,    usually i have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk. thanks, got it.

MONICA:
 hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok?

CHANDLER:
 yeah, i guess!

MONICA:
 i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! no one here even    knows you!

JANICE:
 oh my god!!

CHANDLER:
 oh, come on! commercial break

JANICE:
 ah ahahahhahaa! how great is this!

MONICA:
 hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!

CHANDLER:
 why are you here?

JANICE:
 well, sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...

CHANDLER:
  no no no... i mean, why? why is    she here??

JANICE:
 oh! someone's a little cranky today cuz    they have to do it in a cup!  oh! they gave you the kiddy size (looking    at the cup in his hand).

CHANDLER:
 what!?  

MONICA:
 this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!    

CHANDLER:
 i'd love to stay, but i have eh...  got    a hot date... 

JANICE:
 please... go!  just let me know if you    need a hand!

CHANDLER:
  

PHOEBE:
  hello "ja", it's time    for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole.

RACHEL:
 wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person. (puts her    head in the hole and phoebe enters)

PHOEBE:
 okay, then i'm swedish...

MONICA:
 so, what's your name?

PHOEBE:
 it's a normal swedish name... ikea...

RACHEL:
 oh... what an interesting name.

PHOEBE:
 ja!

RACHEL:
 you know i... (lifts her head and tries to look in phoebe's    direction)

PHOEBE:
  time for your scalp massage!

RACHEL:
  wow... i really love    your... 

PHOEBE:
 is something wrong?

RACHEL:
 no, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea...     yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of sweden?

PHOEBE:
  uhm... stockholm.

RACHEL:
 damn! i wish i knew if that was right!  

JOEY:
  note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.

ROSS:
 now, do you have any idea what you just said?

JOEY:
  no, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!

ROSS:
 ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt    m-o-n-a-y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you.

JOEY:
 phonetically? 

ROSS:
 yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time    for this.

JOEY:
 ok.

ROSS:
 ok, but you know what? i gotta say,    i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!

JOEY:
 ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on "days"    i had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".

ROSS:
 wow. what does that mean?

JOEY:
 no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".

ROSS:
 ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?

JOEY:
 ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! (reaches out to touch the    imaginary painting).

ROSS:
 nah ah! nah ah!  no no no! no ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings.

JOEY:
 come on! you... 

ROSS:
 no!  

CHANDLER:
  my specimen is in the    room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there.    really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees    janice is still there) janice! you're not... gone?

JANICE:
 oh! sid is still in his room. i don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. so did you do it? did you make your deposit?

CHANDLER:
 yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!

JANICE:
 that's not the hard part honey! the hard part is what comes    next, i mean aren't you worried about the results?

CHANDLER:
 i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet...    i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.

JANICE:
 oh! well, you know what? it probably is.

CHANDLER:
  yeah, but what if it's not? what if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?

JANICE:
 oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children.    i am sure it's gonna be just fine.

CHANDLER:
  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe    i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...

JANICE:
 what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?

CHANDLER:
  it was a "wendy's!!    "  

PHOEBE:
  "ipan stripan, glupi glabi! " and that is    the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking! 

RACHEL:
 wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have    a friend who is a masseuse.

PHOEBE:
 oh, ja! ja!

RACHEL:
 yah! she's... uhm... not very good though... 

PHOEBE:
 uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?

RACHEL:
 i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar...

PHOEBE:
 or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're    such a high maintenance tight ass!

RACHEL:
  phoebe!!

PHOEBE:
 you know it's me?

RACHEL:
 for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!

PHOEBE:
 how can you come here?

RACHEL:
 how could you not tell me you worked here?

PHOEBE:
 i don't have to tell you everything!

RACHEL:
 yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage!

PHOEBE:
 tips not included.

RACHEL:
 oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?

PHOEBE:
 because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know...    you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh!    paying taxes!

RACHEL:
 phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles    and i so admire that! i don't have any!

PHOEBE:
 you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time    i took my life back!

RACHEL:
 good for you pheebs!

PHOEBE:
 ok.

PHOEBE:
 okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and    whispers) if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any    of that. i love you.  

ROSS:
 haha! got ya! die, die, die!  

ROSS:
  respectfully, professor    r. geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins charlie on the    sofa) hey!

CHARLIE:
 hi!

ROSS:
 hey, how was the met?

CHARLIE:
 the museum was amazing!

ROSS:
 yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?

CHARLIE:
 not so much, no. he had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.

ROSS:
 what do you mean?

CHARLIE:
 well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around.

ROSS:
  wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the met, did you go to the right?

CHARLIE:
 no, we went to the left.

ROSS:
  oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together.

CHARLIE:
 yeah, it's fun .

ROSS:
 what?

CHARLIE:
 actually, you know, joey is your friend, and you don't really    know me that well; it would be weird.

ROSS:
 what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on.

CHARLIE:
 well... i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe i should be with someone... i have more in common    with. you know what i mean?

ROSS:
  yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey    a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.

CHARLIE:
 yeah, i guess that's true.

ROSS:
 and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you    know, that's the kind of guy joey is.

CHARLIE:
 he is very sweet. plus he's hot!

ROSS:
 that was going to be my next argument.  

JOEY:
 hey!

ROSS:
 hey!

CHARLIE:
 hey!

JOEY:
  you're ready?

CHARLIE:
 yeah, let's go.  thanks    ross.

JOEY:
  hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me    up.

ROSS:
 glad i could help man.

JOEY:
 although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but...  i made it work.  

CHANDLER:
 (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited    his specimen in) it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.  

CHANDLER:
 hello? oh hi, doctor connelly.  no, she's not here    but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? (his smile    fades as he hears the answer) oh.     ok. ok, thank you. thanks.   

MONICA:
 hey sweetie.

CHANDLER:
 doctor connelly just called.

MONICA:
 with good news?  of course    it is not good news, you just said  "doctor connelly just called".    if it was good news you would have said  "doctor connelly just    called! " but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem    with me or with you?

CHANDLER:
 actually it's both of us.

MONICA:
 what?

CHANDLER:
 apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment.

MONICA:
 oh... what does that mean?

CHANDLER:
 it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  it    means...

MONICA:
 chandler?

CHANDLER:
  it means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.

MONICA:
  oh my god!

CHANDLER:
 i'm sorry.

MONICA:
 i'm sorry too.  

CHANDLER:
 well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.

MONICA:
  i know. closing credits
